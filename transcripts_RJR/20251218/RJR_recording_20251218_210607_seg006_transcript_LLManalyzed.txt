20251218 210607 I see you staring at the corner of my eye You seem uneasy, won't you approach me, throw me a line But there's something inside you, grab your sense, who am I? I know exactly cause it happens with all the guys Show you so much you're gonna do Come on and touch me Promise you won't even have an attitude Unless Unless you say it but next to me. Don't join my list with the other fools. That ain't the way to be. Yes it's cool, yes I'm in the mood. In simple days, just go and find your heart again.
