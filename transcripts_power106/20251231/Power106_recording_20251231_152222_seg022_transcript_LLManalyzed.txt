20251231 152222 name is very important. So the day where me born Jesse is more important to I, more than the date, because the date will always move, but you will never find the day move. So no one can come tell me, say that Thursday is my birthday and me never born on a Thursday. It's only my birthday, not my birthday because me never born on Thursday. I have a niece who was born on the 29th of February and it's her 5th year. She has a birthday. And I live here. You understand what I'm suggesting? And some of the times when you put across these things, people are going to say, boy, I must say I'm mad, man, that I'm crazy. But let me tell you, time out. And look, because I am saying that there is no, it's only when the 22nd of January pass and I choose it, it's my birthday.
