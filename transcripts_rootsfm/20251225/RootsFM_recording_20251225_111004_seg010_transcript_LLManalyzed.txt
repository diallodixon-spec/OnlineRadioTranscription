20251225 111004 That it's never over, only satisfied Oh it's you, sweet baby I don't wanna be free from your embrace Sweet baby, only hoping it's not too late to try Oh yeah, it's you Sweet baby, I ever know I wasn't captured by your smile Sweet baby, I was gonna be right there by your side. Right by your side. Lying here alone, I'm dreaming. My mind keep wandering. My thoughts are all blue. Looking through the memories in my mind. How a love so real could come so empty, I just keep wondering why. Will I ever find the love we shared together, you and I? Oh, it's you, sweet baby.
