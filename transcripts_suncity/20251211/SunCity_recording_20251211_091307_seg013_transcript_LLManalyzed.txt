And why not? I know you're able. And my God, come through again. You can do all things, you can do all things but fail, cause you never lost a a battle No, you've never lost a battle And I know, I know You never will Everything's possible By the power of the Holy Ghost. A new wind is blowing right now. Breaking my heart of stone, taking over like hysterical. And my walls are all crashing down.
