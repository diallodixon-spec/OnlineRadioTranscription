============================================================

One who'd love me better than you. Well, it may have come as a surprise. Loneliness has opened my eyes. I tried every love I could find. Still, I can't get you out of my mind. Cause there's no one in the world to hold me. No one in the world's gonna move me. No one can love me like you do, baby. Every time I'm with someone, loving you, yes, I wanna run. I wanna run back to your arms again Ain't no one in the world Loves me like you do
