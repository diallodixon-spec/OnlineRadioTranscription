2025-12-12 10:03:47 I feel is to this swing life jungle over feelings to this swing life I'm a white duck in a family suit Why you say I did nothing for you? If I do anything you want me to do Maybe another time, maybe another life You will be my wife and we'll get it right In the old cast, last last Now everybody got your breakfast Have to say bye bye yo, bye bye yo, to the love of my life.
