20251217 201315 But if we just started dating, how am I getting you a Christmas and birthday gift? It's because my birthday is coming in November. If you don't get me anything for November, I won't get you anything for Christmas. Please, sex is not a gift. You've been giving me sex all year. I have to say, why can't I meet your mom more than once? That's a red flag for me. Don't come propose at the Christmas dinner. But everyone is there. But Christmas time when everyone is like together and we like make a plan, yeah. He can link his family a couple days after. Like if we're in a relationship, you have to find time for your person. Yeah, so we're gonna find a time. Boxing day, the 27th to 28th, all the way up to New Year's Eve. Single period during Christmas where we're scrolling and we're seeing the matching pajamas and the gift giving and you're like aww.
