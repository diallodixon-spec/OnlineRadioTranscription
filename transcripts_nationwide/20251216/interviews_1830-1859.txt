Jamaica Teachers Association President Mark Malava Speaks on Wage Negotiations and Teacher Value

In a recent interview on Nationwide 90 FM, President of the Jamaica Teachers Association (JTA), Mark Malava, discussed the ongoing wage negotiations between the JTA and the government. Malava emphasized the importance of recognizing the value and worth of teachers, citing reports such as the Earth and Young report, which valued teachers at a particular level. He noted that teachers are amongst the lowest paid in the Caribbean, while politicians are amongst the highest paid.

Malava stressed that the JTA is seeking a salary increase that reflects the worth and value of teachers, taking into account the fiscal realities of the country. He pointed out that education is the single biggest contributor to productivity and GDP levels in Jamaica, and that investing in teachers is essential to improving education outcomes.

When asked about the percentage of the annual education budget spent on teacher salaries and fringe benefits, Malava estimated it to be above 50%, while the host suggested it was closer to 80%. Malava argued that despite the significant expenditure on teacher salaries, the data shows that over 90% of teachers are performing at a satisfactory level or higher, indicating that the investment in teachers is yielding positive results.

The interview highlighted the challenges faced by the JTA in negotiating with the government, particularly in the aftermath of Hurricane Melissa, which has had a significant impact on the country's economy. Malava emphasized the need for transparent and good-faith negotiations, taking into account the value and worth of teachers, as well as the fiscal realities of the country.

The JTA has submitted claims for salary increases, which are currently outstanding, and Malava expressed his commitment to continuing negotiations with the government to reach a fair and reasonable agreement. The interview provided insight into the complex issues surrounding teacher compensation and the importance of recognizing the value and worth of educators in Jamaica.
