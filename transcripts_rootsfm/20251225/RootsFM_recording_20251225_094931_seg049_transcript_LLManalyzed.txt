20251225 094931 A song with joyful ring all caroling One seems to hear words of good cheer From everywhere filling the air Gently they ring while people sing Songs of good cheer Christmas is here Merry, merry, merry, merry Christmas. Merry, merry, Merry, Merry, Merry Christmas. On and on they sing, on and on without end, their joyful tune to ev'ry home. Ding, ding, ding, ding.
