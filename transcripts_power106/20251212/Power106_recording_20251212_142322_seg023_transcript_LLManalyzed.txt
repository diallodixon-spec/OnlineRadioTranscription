2025-12-12 14:58:02 that today is being observed globally as International Universal Health Coverage Day. What exactly is that? And yeah, the theme is quite interesting. Unaffordable health costs, we're sick of it. Now the day aims to raise awareness of the need for strong and resilient health systems and universal health coverage with multi-stakeholder partners. Each year on December 12, Universal Health Coverage Day advocates raise their voices to share the stories of the millions of people still waiting for health, to champion what we've achieved so far as a global village, and to call on leaders to make bigger and smarter investments in health and encourage diverse groups to make commitments to help move the world closer to universal health coverage by 2030.
