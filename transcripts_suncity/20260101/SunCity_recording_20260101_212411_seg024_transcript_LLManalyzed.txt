20260101 212411 I guess we've come to the serious part. I need to find out if there's a chance for us. Don't give me that same old look. You won't win me over Don't give me that same old speech You don't have to speak at all You can say you love me That I'm your perfect crush How it hurts to need someone that much You can swear you mean it But that ain't good enough
