20251224 102210 Queen Jojo Alastair this is Jojo I apologize for calling in so late I haven't even sent my greetings yet I've been driving and I'm in an appointment and I can't listen to my radio so I am deaf today but I have to wish you all a very Merry Christmas and to my Sunite brothers and sisters all around the globe. I just want to say you guys have made Jojo happier, happier, happier every single day. Sun City, oh my Lord, the day I found Sun City. Oh, it was one of the best days of my life. So I just want to say Merry Christmas for 2025. And you all have a festive Christmas. Eat, be merry, have fun, laugh, hug each other, kiss each other, and be safe.
