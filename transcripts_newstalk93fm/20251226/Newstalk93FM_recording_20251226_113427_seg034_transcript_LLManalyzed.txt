20251226 113427 We are the island, I tell you what's good. So pray for me. If I don't come home in the morning, just know that I say it's not in my place. But this man's have a hold on me. I can't leave until every single button down. If anyone look it for me, then you can do it. Oh Ready to walk, chest up, hold it, time to feel. Carnival won't let me go. To send a search party to find me. I out on the road and line me. Tell them that it's over, I'm made. You won't see me Wednesday. To send a such party to find me, I lost on the road and right me. Tell them, that it's over. I'm made.
