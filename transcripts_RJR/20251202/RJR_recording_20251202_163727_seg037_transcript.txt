Let me feel mushy and kiss up and cocky When you walk out, everybody has to look Wind up your body can't live for one foot All I read in your subway, they call it you a crook Tick tock, tick tock, not good Broke it and set it and broke it, get good At the end of your ear, straight lines in your mouth It's a favor, our love can't run out Anytime you have any doubt What is under me knows for me Yes, you remind me. I want you to tell the world Slowly be what you take time and wine What you possess, girl, is also mine Never met a girl so gorgeous and fine Ever so often I've got to remind you that Who me to choose? Excuse me, excuse me, excuse me I'm real Jamaican, solid like a rock Treat her like a queen
