I'll be there for you with anything you're facing I'll be your sunlight when it's raining Stay together and we go in places, yeah I'll be by your side no matter the case We have a one way ticket to greatness, greatness Girl I don't want to lie, cause I believe in the truth And I just wanna live good I just want to live And I don't want no dirty secrets fighting me and you, boy I could only drive one car at a time But I still want to But I still want too Now let me get to the truth, truth, truth I just wanna live cool
