20251217 113024 I wish you a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year when it comes to you and God Minister of Justice and Constitutional Reform, the Honorable Delroy Chuk. Hurricane Melissa has left deep wounds across our nation. Lives have been upended, homes and livelihoods shattered, and communities that once bustled with hope now face immense challenges. Our people have always risen to meet adversity.
