============================================================

Every promise that he made will come to pass. He won't go back on his word. Every promise that made it will come to pass, keep trusting and believing all things. Supply in the hard times, Light in your darkness. Faith in the bad. And afraid when you're lonely. Keep your vision for your dreams. As I haven't seen Nor have it heard Everything you shall be But tonight I need you
