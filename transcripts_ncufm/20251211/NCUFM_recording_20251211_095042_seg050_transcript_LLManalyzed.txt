It's a beautiful day So yeah, no, I walked through the valleys of the shadows of death I was there, no, we even won't be this made When I see the clock kicking away And things are not in place everything in life happens for a reason disappointment comes with a lesson it's a meter red wiser got to work harder in the end it will get better thank you for rain thank you for joy thank you for joy, thank you for pain It's a beautiful day, it's a beautiful day
