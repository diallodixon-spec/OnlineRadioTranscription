============================================================

hypothetical question you posed. No, I did not pose the hypothetical question. The question was posed by a listener. I read, I am reading the things posted by people. I did not post the question. So I'll read this correctly. Dr. Gale, the hypothetical question posed to you is what faced the country in 1988 hmm what happened in 1980 again do you recall what happened in election held early in 1989 1989 1989 Michael Manley won that election. Do you want to just text and remind me? I have to apologize. I'm not, I'm not omniscient. I don't remember what really happened completely.
