Now maybe you haven't been there before But you've had to go through trials and great tribulations But is there anybody that learned how to bless the Lord in the midst of everything? Listen listen listen to the storm in the rain I will bless the Lord. I will sing this. He has done great things for me, so I will. Say it again. He's done great things. I love you. So I will. We have done great things. She has done great things.
