20260102 094232 We operate so informally because one of the things I realise we don't have problems with is just basic identification. There are some people who are not a part of the formal economy. They don't have any ID. It's amazing. There are many people who come to my office and don't have any valid form of government issued identification. And so that is one of the things that is a problem. Another problem we have is the informal settlements. So you're going to get money to put back a house, but put it back where? A land that you don't own? big problem yes yes yes yes yes
