2025-12-12 13:22:57 I'm so in love, so deep in love You made my life complete You are so sweet, no more complaints Glad you came into my life You got me right to love, with you I am excited You saved my life, so I say I was loved, wow Never thought about, settling down But all the time I knew, I was lucky, never thought about settling down But all the time I knew, I was ready But not with all my friends around But girl, I put you first now You made me, you moved me, turned me into a man I'm so so responsible and I owe it all to you My whole life has changed I knew back then I'm a world that's as your world
