20251225 113430 Once bitter and twice shy I keep my distance but you still catch my eye Tell me baby, do you recognize me? Well, this feeling, it doesn't surprise me Happy Christmas, I rocked it every Sunday Weird thing I can say, I love you, I meant it Now I know what a fool I've been But if you kiss me now I know you'd fool me again Last Christmas I gave you my heart But the very next day you gave it away You gave it away
