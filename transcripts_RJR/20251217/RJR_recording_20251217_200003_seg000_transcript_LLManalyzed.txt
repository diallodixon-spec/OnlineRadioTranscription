20251217 200003 We may not all agree on what makes Christmas special. For some, it's the fellowship. For others, it's the feasting, the food. But we can all agree that purple is the color most associated with royalty. And I'm certain that a certain group would agree. The Kingston College Chapel Choir celebrates the reason for the season. A kingly arrival with a time-ordered Christmas classic. That's it for today's program. Join us next time when we highlight happenings round about J.A. Until then, I'm Joy Jamaica. This is Radio Jamaica at 8 o'clock. Good evening and welcome to this, the nightcap for the 17th day. It's Wednesday.
