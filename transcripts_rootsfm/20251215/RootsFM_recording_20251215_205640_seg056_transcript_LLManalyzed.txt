Living up, come make the tree soon snatched them in space in one day You see, I said the people them Inna the west, the well of them gone crazy Yeah, them love me, we got them chest, yeah, them they inna slavery Them cana, I'm not fool without no money So fool the system and the fruitful side And let them hungry, So clean up your ways. Rinse up your thoughts. Lose no more doggies, because I won't force you to start. Babylon has sealed their soul and their heart. Get thee in peace, and now we want to walk through them. Black people keep your heads down. Empires are lost in the night.
