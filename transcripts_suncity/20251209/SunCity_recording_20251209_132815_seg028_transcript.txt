Sun City! One-on-one fight down's it! We make it to the finish line! It's very spooky Life rough, I'm odd Hard life, safe use, Viagra They want me like Niagara But man, stay strong, cause I have drugs Don't control my life, I'm drunk They're bad, so I'm drunk I'm juggling, they're not sweet, so I'm dead They're so nice, so I put up with toxic They don't want me relaxing, me girl, they don't want top spot They're here, it's a massage, me back wall
