20251219 095135 So sweet, so sweet, so sweet Every time you pass me, skin me teeth Me and the melody, anima, the beat That's how we do it Who you remember? Every word your eyes spoke to me The sweetest surrender Thought that I would grow so weary The love gets better Now my girlfriends, they see it too The glow on my face is because of you, you are You're my piece of mind, mind, mind Oh, all mine Now Never catch a vibe that feels so right.
