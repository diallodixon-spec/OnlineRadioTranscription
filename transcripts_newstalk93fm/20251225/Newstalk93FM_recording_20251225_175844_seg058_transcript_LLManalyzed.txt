20251225 175844 We can go ahead and just head out and chill up in my villa, take it out the whole night. Just get in the drop top, take the head out and cruise with your head outside. Go ahead, it's your time baby. It's your time baby, get my baby. That's the difference when you're my baby, that's how it is when you. Nobody make me stop the world. Tell me what to do when these people don't know what you been through. You survive through the night, through the dark.
