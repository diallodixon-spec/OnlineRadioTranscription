2025-12-11 16:00:58 temperatures have worsened the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, where thousands of displaced families are struggling to survive in makeshift tent camps. Winter storm Byron swept across the territory on Thursday, drenching tents and flooding large sections of the camps, some areas knee-deep in muddy water. Families reported that their belongings, clothing, and food supplies were soaked. Children waded through cold, brown floodwater while trucks tried to navigate slowly through the camps to avoid creating waves that could overwhelm the already fragile shelters. Piles of garbage and sewage spilled into the streams of water, heightening fears of disease. A Kenan court has suspended the implementation of a landmark 5.2 billion health aid deal signed with the U.S. last week over data privacy concerns. It follows a case filed by a consumer rights lobby seeking to stop the alleged transfer and sharing of Kenyan's personal data under the agreement. The interim ruling now bars Kenan authorities from taking any steps.
