Minister of Water, Environment and Climate Change Matthew Samuda says architects and engineers from overseas are scheduled to arrive on the island as early as January to help with the national reconstruction efforts following Hurricane Melissa. Minister Samuda was leading a team from the Fund for Responding to Loss and Damage, FRLD, on a tour of communities in St. Elizabeth and Westmoreland on Thursday. The government is looking to access between 5 million and 20 million US dollars in grant funding from the fund, which recently launched a US $250 million initiative for countries impacted by the storm. Minister Samuda says the tour was to give the multilateral partners a clear, on-the-ground understanding of the scale of the damage across coastal towns and communities where homes, public buildings and critical infrastructure were severely impacted.
