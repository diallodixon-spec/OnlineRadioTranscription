20260101 123026 Oh, oh, oh Sweet love, yeah I didn't mean it when I said I didn't love you so I shoulda held on tight, I never shoulda let you go I didn't know nothing, I was stupid, I was foolish, I was lying to myself I couldn't know farther, that would ever be without your love Never imagined I'd be sitting here beside myself Cause I didn't know you, cause I didn't know me But if I knew everything, I'd never fail The feeling that I'm feeling now that I don't hear your voice
