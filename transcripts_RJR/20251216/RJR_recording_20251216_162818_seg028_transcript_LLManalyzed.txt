20251216 162818 We bring the light, light, light. Shine through the ceiling with a little focus on us. Light it up, light down. Fill your eyes, fill your eyes. I don't. I don't I don't. Look out, look out, shape like a death pattern It's a good piece of mental sand at the cap A piece of game and me love how you chat Watchin' if you step on the paper the way you got Stayin' in my pain, in my pain, on the touch Man, leave me, man, leave me This love, if not deep, the way you move Let me acknowledge the way you do Then I would not lie, baby, you Beat me up like Cardi, here we go
