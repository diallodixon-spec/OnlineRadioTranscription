So the Senate passed a bill to amend the Jamaica Nationality Act of 1962. The bill, moved by the Attorney General, Senator the Honorable Victor Grant, sought to amend the 1962 act by giving the minister power to vary the list of countries in the schedule to the act. Its purpose? To invest the minister with the power so that where changes occur in the names of countries listed in the schedule, he may amend the schedule accordingly. In moving the bill, Senator Grant, the Attorney General, pointed out that the amendment had become necessary because recently, this is back in 1965,, several countries, among them, Tanzanica, Zanzibar, Niasaland, and Southern Rhodesia, had changed their names.
