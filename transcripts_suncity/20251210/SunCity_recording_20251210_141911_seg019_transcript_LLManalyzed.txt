You're gonna stay with me for life I'm taking you home with me tonight Cause I'm a lover, baby I wanna fight She said she didn't know where she was going Aren't you know she had to leave fast? Cause if she didn't leave, she didn't know how long she was gonna last. So many times he told her sorry, so many times he said he'd stop. But she goes on and on, her mind's made up. She said she ain't going back. And just like a knight in shining armor, I used my charm as a cover. Engage her in a good conversation, just trying to ease her frustration. As she told me her story, I told her, baby, no worry, I'm the man that you're looking for.
