============================================================

since the year 1816. So many other celebrations taking place today in Jamaica and around the world. And by the way, today is Wednesday, December 3, 2025, the 337th day of the year in the Gregorian calendar. Only 28 days remain until the end of the year. We greet you well wherever in the world you are listening to us right now. We remain eternally grateful for the gift of life and the privilege to serve you on yet another edition of your program, both sides of the story. We don't ever take your listenership for granted. It is a perfectly competitive media landscape here in Jamaica. Through traditional media and new media, we know you have choices. And that's why we never, ever forget to remember to say thanks for choosing to listen to both sides of the story. Monday to Friday, 2 to 5, right here on Power 106.
