Hello, hello, hello, yeah. So get out of my way, you blow my mind. Hold me tight and bring the wine. Hello, hello, Hello, hello. Are you ready? Ready. Are you ready for this? Are you ready? Are you ready for it? I give it up all night. I need some Friday. I'm givin' up all I'm just for the sun. They're yelling at the army. We'll be steppin' at the party. I wanna hop up on a yardie. Watch me dancin' on you. Music tickle all I don't know. I will be eight, so I get low. I know you want me high as hell. And I want you fast, like slow. Only man say, girl, I'm your fan, too. Now, boy, you way go. Now, boy you drop low. You set the place on fire, girl. I ain't no mommy, mom. Girl, I ain't no Mommy, mom. Girl.
