20251218 114932 delighted to have you join us. Again, we just can't overemphasize that you must be your brother's keeper. And, you know, we, throughout the year, we broadcast things that happen, some of them just so sad. Recently, we talk about a situation over there in Portland, where two friends, they had an altercation, gathered over $1,000. And now, one is in jail, and the other is lying cold in the morgue. Please, please, I beg you my brothers and sisters. There is an advert, a billboard all over that's saying let's talk it out.
