20251217 153118 I search for the time on a watch with no hands I want to see you clearly come closer than this But all I remember are the dreams in the past These dreams go on when I close my eyes Every second of the night, I live another life These dreams that sleep when it's cold outside Every moment I'm awake, the further I'm awake Is it cloak and dagger? Could it be spring or fall? I walk without a cut through a stained glass wall
