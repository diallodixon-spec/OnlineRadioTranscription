And could you tell me, boy? When was the, last time? Could you tell me? When you asked to pray and go down from your knee When was the last, time you prayed, yeah? When was, the last time you prayed, yeah? Never be ungrateful, you have to give thanks For everything where you're gain Don't bother pray for your bread or big feasts Beg your please give thanks For the liquor in your plate Look out and before you push out of your house Beg your wall of reverence You don't know what trouble lies ahead.
