And everything you had got destroyed. Hey, little mama, ooh, you're a center. Hot little picker, yes, you're a winner. And I'm so glad to be yours. You're a class, oh, you're running., little cutie, when you talk to me, I swear the whole world stops. You're my sweetheart, and I'm so glad that you're mine. You are whatever comes in, you'll be mine.
