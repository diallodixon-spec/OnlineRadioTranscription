20251223 115734 Yeah, don't get caught up. Be thankful for what we have. We have life and Melissa has shown that we have life and because we have life, we can go even deeper. We can build even better. Oh, I will say. We can love even deeper. You understand? So true, so true. I just want to say thank you. Just for a moment. I said I had to call you. You know what I'm saying? Yeah, let's give you a call before the holiday season. Thank you for touching this. Of course. And thanks for sending me the song. Oh my gosh. Yeah. I said, you're the first person I sent it to yesterday. I said, listen, Roots of Emny, we recorded it last year. But you know, a song, a Christmas song takes years and years for it to live. Yes. Yes. You know, because it's only happened one month of music, of Christmas music. Right. Right. So I appreciate it. I love it. And I will continue to play it. And I noticed you were playing. You were playing. You touched a little bit on Santa Claus. You ever come to the ghetto?
