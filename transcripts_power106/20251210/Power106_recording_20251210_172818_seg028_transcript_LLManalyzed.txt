A lot of tires that we see that are bargain tires are not made with the rigors and the standards of a higher priced tire. And I'm going to say this to you because it does happen and I've seen it happen. It happens to me as well. Where we hit a pothole with a tire that is fairly new. But you hit this pothole so hard that the plies became loose inside. They're not attached to each other anymore and it's now what we call a warped tire. So now you're going to either feel a bumping in your steering wheel when you're driving or a heavy vibration that balancing can't get rid of. You literally have to buy a new tire, right? So this is some of the things that we have to navigate when we're trying to save money but then in the long run it's costing us more money because we now have to go and buy another tire and then the thing is you may be halfway in the wear of the tire you really should not be buying a brand new tire with one that is 50% wound
