20251215 094739 Welcome back, Peter. Thank you. Yes. Okay, so The Richest Man in Babylon is, you know, one of those timeless books that people in finance know about, maybe the wider public doesn't, but you can look it up on Amazon, right? And one of the things, easy read, easy read if you want to learn about money. One of the things I say in that book is pay yourself first, right? Yes. That's one of the principles. So before you run around spending on everything, what about yourself? You know, why don't you allocate some portion of that check to get monthly for your salary to you and your own financial well-being? I'll have a joke internally in the office. I always say to people, it's amazing that how programmed we are to give away your own money we can't wait to get that paycheck to give it to somebody so think of yourself as a bill just like how you pay bills right and just put aside something for your financial independence
