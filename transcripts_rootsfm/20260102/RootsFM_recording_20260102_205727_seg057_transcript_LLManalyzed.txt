20260102 205727 La, la, la, la. La, la, da, dee, da, da, da. Yeah. I must confess, girl, yes, I'm gonna be your lover. Take a chance. My lover's like no other. On the dance floor, getting down. Hold tight. I never let you down. My love's definitely the key. Like boys and men, I'm all bent and neat. Love is you, not like yourself.
