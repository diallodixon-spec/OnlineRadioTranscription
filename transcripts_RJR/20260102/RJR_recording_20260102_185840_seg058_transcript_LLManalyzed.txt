20260102 185840 to replace Manchester City, Bournemouth are on 23 points. Six more games will be played on Sunday. Brendan Johnson is set to be included in Crystal Palace's squad to face Newcastle on Sunday after the forward's club-record £35 million move from Tottenham was finalised on Friday. Bournemouth were also keen to sign the Wales international as a replacement for Manchester City target Antoine Simeon. But after talks with Palace boss Olivier Glassen on Thursday, Johnson was persuaded to move to Sellers Park. Johnson's arrival eclipses the £27 million the Eagles paid for Liverpool striker Christian Benteke in 2016 as their record transfer. He joined Spurs in a £47.5 million deal from Nottingham Forest in 2023 and scored the winner as the club ended their 17-year wait for silverware with Europa League success last season. But Johnson's minutes have been limited on the Spurs manager Thomas Frank this term.
