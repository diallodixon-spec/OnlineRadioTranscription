20251217 133723 I bet you if me get a little closer, want to grab me like your controller, and make note of how me wheels are moving so nice. Yes, I'm on a romantic call, talking to my baby over the yard I'm on a romance call You like it, you can't go take the fraud I don't want the call then Y'all like you but then I say I love you from when One star, nothing to borrow from them So don't stop when you're buying a pam-pam Your phone line may ring a million times Now ease up a bit, special me a sign And if you don't pick it up and love, let the me a sign Your Your ratings, higher than a mountain, are great things. With the future we chosen, we open. My arms come baby, you're golden. You try to feel me crazy, but it's frozen. And nothing less than a fifth time to me, baby. I'm on a romantic ride.
