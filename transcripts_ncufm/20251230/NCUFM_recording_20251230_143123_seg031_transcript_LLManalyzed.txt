20251230 143123 Alternatives Wednesdays at 10.30 a.m. on your education and wellness station. Welcome to the family, we're glad that you have come to share your life with us, grow in love and may we always be to you what God would have us be, a family always there to be strong. A family always there that we can lean on. But this drive time family is an open invitation to everybody listening. I say welcome to the family.
