20251229 153020 I've been hurt a few times Once been twice shy Now all that dirt is behind I won't sit and cry You better tell the truth And don't you deny it all You fool around with someone you Don't try and hide it You're giving me reason For. Cause I can see something's changed. And I know you're lying. You've given me reason for suspicion, cause I can see something strange. You're giving me six for a nine. Well, I'm a woman of the new millennium. I'm not a genius, but I've got wisdom. I know what I'm saying when I say you're playing. So you better wise up and stop and realize it's up to you. I want to share.
