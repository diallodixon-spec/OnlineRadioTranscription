20251218 162015 I am in the mood right now And my body is calling The way you look at me Increase my energy Longing to hold you tight Sweet loving till morning light This feeling I'm having No need for me to lie Oh baby My temperature is rising I know what's fragile, that's the one thing I learned. Cause if you want to take another man, I know that's not my concern. But if I ever find out, that's when the relationship crash and burn.
