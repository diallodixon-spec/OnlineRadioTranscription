20251217 142119 Absolutely. This morning we've come together to celebrate excellence. In fact, we're in the afternoon, right? So this afternoon we're here to celebrate excellence and to reaffirm a legacy, one built on a vision of our late Honourable Lascelles Chin, the founder and former chairman. It was his deep respect for law enforcement and his belief in the power of public service that gave birth to what was once known as the police officer of the year program. Mr. Chin understood that the strength of our nation lies way beyond the policies and plans that we put in place and goes to the hearts of those who serve others. He believed that honoring the humanity behind the uniform could inspire and transform Jamaica.
