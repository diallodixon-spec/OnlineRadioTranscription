20251224 161411 Oh, I'm going crazy. Oh, sweet thing. Don't you know you're my everything? Oh, sweet thing, don't you know you are my everything? Yes, you will. I wish you were my lover, but you act so undercover. Love you child my whole life, as long as be right or be wrong. I'm only what you make me, baby. Don't walk away, don't be so shady. Don't want your mind, don't want your money. These words I said, they may sound funny, but oh, sweet thing. Don't you know you're my everything?
