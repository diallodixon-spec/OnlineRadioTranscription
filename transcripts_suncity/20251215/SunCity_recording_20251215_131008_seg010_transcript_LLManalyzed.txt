You do It's time for the naughty dread You know it's not the night to dream. I don't know if you're going to be born again. You don't know. Who goes to the game? I don't know. You go to the game? You don't know who we are. It's not a night to dream. We're the ghost in my head Makes me forget that I still need this old love
