The deceased is 37-year-old Nikhil D'Souza, also called O'Dane, a construction worker. It's reported that sometime after nine, a police team was on patrol in Inata Bay when they engaged Mr. D'Souza who behaved in a manner that aroused a suspicion. During the interaction, he allegedly pulled a firearm and pointed it in the direction of the police. The police and officer shot Mr. D'Souza in response. He was transported to hospital where he was pronounced dead. The police say a black and silver single action 9mm pistol with a magazine of fix containing 12 rounds of ammunition was recovered at the scene. The Independent Commission of Investigations is probing the shooting. A Jamaican citizen was yesterday sentenced to five years in a U.S. prison for participating in a long-running scheme to defraud an elderly California woman.
