20260102 130203 I'm pleased to be chillin' in the West Indies Not provide all my wants and needs I got the sunshine, rivers and trees Relieved, yeah When the rain pit up on the roof Just a steam paper put on the skew Like it's a dream if you got gratitude So go tell the regime they can't stop where we do now Information you think on your own Or else you're a slave to the things that you know What do you know if you learn every day? So be careful of things where you say Who knows, who knows, who knows I just go work a trade in clothes Sendin' love to my friends and foes And I suppose I'm pleased To be chillin' in the West Indies I'll provide all the wants and needs I got the sunshine, rivers and trees
