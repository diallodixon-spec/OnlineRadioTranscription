20251226 181712 And calm the storm in me Not because of who I am But because of what you've done Not because of what I've done But because of who you are I am a flower quickly fading Here today and gone tomorrow A wave tossed in the ocean A vapor in the wind is still you Hear me when I'm calling Lord you catch me when I'm falling You've told me who I am I am yours
