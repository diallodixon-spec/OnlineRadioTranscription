20251212 163321 Welcome back to the E-Zone, I'm the stinger Honey B, he's to be his Korean boy things alongside DJ Jerome. You're in the hot seat with a DJ Mac. Oh, yeah, I mean DJ. Congratulations on ups and downs hitting number one on the iTunes reggae album chart. I mean, that's a big feat. Yeah, but you know that the title of the album is so telling, ups and downs. Talk to us about this journey, the up and the down and the thing that shaped you as a producer. That's why my name is like that because it's obvious. Boy, I'm tired of seeing people on the phone screaming, some banger is wrong.
