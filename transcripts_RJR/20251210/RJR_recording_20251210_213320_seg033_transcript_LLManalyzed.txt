I don't want a lot for Christmas There is just one thing I need I don't care about the presents Underneath the Christmas tree I just want you for my own More than you could ever know. Make my wish come true. All I want a lot for Christmas. There is just one thing I need. And I don't care about the present. Come and meet the Christmas tree.
