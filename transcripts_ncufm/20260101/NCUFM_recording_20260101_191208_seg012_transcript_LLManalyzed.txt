20260101 191208 We sing this song, not as a song of desperation, but we sing it as a song of affirmation. Don't we all need the wonderful touch of Jesus tonight? All over the building, I want you to join with the choir. I want you to lift your hearts. I want to focus on the Lord tonight and sing this wonderful song that simply says, I need thee, oh come to thee. Let this be your prayer tonight. Let this be the call from your heart. We can say a prayer and a song.
