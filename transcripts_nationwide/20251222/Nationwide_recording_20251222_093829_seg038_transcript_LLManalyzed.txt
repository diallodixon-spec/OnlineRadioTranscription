Nadine, for those students who are in Canada and may be traveling back home for the holidays, if you could just remind them of what they need to ensure that they have and documents that they need to ensure are up to date and in good standing as they travel to their home country and back for school. travel, please ensure that you do have a valid visa to return to Canada. Because if you apply for an extension and you have a valid visitor, worker, or student extension, you also need to have a valid visitor's visa or valid visa to re-enter the country.
