20251231 111517 It's always been a big problem for us. It's a matter of it. Right. That's correct, that's correct. So when the Prime Minister does his New Year message tomorrow, we want to know where we are now. Well, I know the people of Jamaica want to know, where we are now in terms of the economy. What is it that is going to happen during the first quarter of next year in terms of the rehabilitation process. What is going to happen in the second quarter, what is going to happen the third quarter, what is all going to happen the fourth quarter. We want the Prime Minister to provide a macroeconomic and a macro-social road map for the rest of the, for next year. So we don't want any foolishness. Those are the things that we want to hear from him next year, when he speaks tomorrow. What is going to happen in the first quarter? When we plan to complete the negotiations with the multilateral agencies? When we start, when we plan to start to increase and fully spend the capital budget? Those are some of the things we want to hear. First quarter, second quarter.
