Oh, Lord. Oh, them Lord. Ha ha ha. Ha ha ha ha. Not at all! In comes King Kabaka, lyrical champion Watch me chop up the rhythm like a sword from Japan So bright and full swing like a real Chinese man Practitioner of yoga but not Indian Lyrics them a weapon of mass destruction Me have nuclear bomb like a American Can't overstand like an Egyptian I'm a glyphic when I shift it to the fifth dimension. And the rhythm not a fit me religion. You get twist up and flat up like a Brazilian. File off your face with the mic in my hand. Then sip a cup of tea like I come from England. A long time on the DJ in the dark.
