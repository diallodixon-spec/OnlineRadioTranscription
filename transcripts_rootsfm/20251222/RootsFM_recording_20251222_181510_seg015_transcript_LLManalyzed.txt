20251222 181510 I don't want no man to take me for a ride But someone to hold me And keep me by his side And give me, give me lovin' All I need is some lovin' Some good, good lovin', All I need is his lovin' What I like in a man, is when he treats me right. What I don't like in a man is when he fuss and fight. Just give me, give me love enough. All I need is some loving.
