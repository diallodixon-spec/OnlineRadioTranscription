20251224 103623 Okay, that name popped up. Okay. Bless you, bless you, bless you. Good morning to you, the staff and listeners of RGI. Let me extend Christmas greetings to you all. Seeing videos of downtown market district in a garbage situation on the street, I think the KSAMC should engage some of the handcard vendors to continuously remove the trash to strategically place containers which would be cleared throughout the day. This would definitely keep the areas clean and presentable while the cleaners earn an income. What do you think of this idea? I think it's a brilliant idea. It's a brilliant idea, actually. Bertie, brilliant idea. Can't say no about it. Yes. I can't say anything. It's a brilliant idea. All right. Happy, happy, happy, happy. And peace be with you, Dr. T, DT, and Madam Producer George and the family
