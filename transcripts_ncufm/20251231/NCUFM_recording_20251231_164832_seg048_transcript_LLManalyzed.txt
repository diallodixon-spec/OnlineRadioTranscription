20251231 164832 Have a good and God-Blessed evening. Hold my hands So I'll never touch again Any pain that is not Not within your plan Hold my eyes so I can see All the things that I should be hold my hands so I may never touch again. Hold my hands so I can be, all the things that should be, touch my hands. Touch my hands. Oh, touch my feet. Touch my feet.
