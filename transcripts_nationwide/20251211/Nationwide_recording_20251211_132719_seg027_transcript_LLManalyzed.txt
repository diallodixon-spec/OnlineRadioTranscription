Have you ever loved? You keep running, running away I know you can't run forever You think you're heading for a heartbreak again Just as you did before I can teach you how to love again If you just trust in me I can show you things you'll never see You don't know how much I'm missing Have you ever loved somebody? Can you ever love somebody? The way somebody loves you? Have you ever known that feeling? Ooh, that special feeling
