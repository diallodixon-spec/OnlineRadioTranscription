20251226 102523 Is this a dream? Am I awake? Moon on your skin Hands round your waist Music is love And I hear a tune I play The way how you're moving Got me feeling away, away, away. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. A chance at least. Mm, it's gonna be a good day We're rockin' from Sunday to Sunday But now I miss how we moved But just how I kinda moved Don't make me rock and move
