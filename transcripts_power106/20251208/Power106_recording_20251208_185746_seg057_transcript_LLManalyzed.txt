============================================================

What is in front of us is two games, February 26th against the Bahamas and March 1st against Canada. Those are the other two teams in our pool, our qualifying pool. There's currently 16 teams in this World Cup qualifier. 16 will be paired down to 12. And then from those 12, the top 7 will go to the World Cup in 27 in Qatar, so We have Bahamas on February 26th Canada on March 1st and both of those games are supposed to be played in Jamaica so what we are doing now is is to find the support, the funding, the people that want to get behind this movement and help us bring big-time basketball to the country.
