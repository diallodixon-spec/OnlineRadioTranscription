20251225 204830 together on this night and celebrating love. There's never anything wrong with people getting along. Doesn't matter what the color. I'll sing a song and friends will tag along. Ooh, the mood is perfect just like it's supposed to be. So have no fear. The Christmas spirit is here. I'm gonna dress up and go out and celebrate this year. Please step in for this Christmas I'll be grooving I can hear the sleigh bells ringing I can hear the choir singing
