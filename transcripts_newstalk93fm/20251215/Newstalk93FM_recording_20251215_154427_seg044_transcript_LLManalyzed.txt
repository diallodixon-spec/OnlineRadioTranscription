20251215 154427 I know you're anxious, you want me to touch it, girl. But welcome, trust me, I want you to trust it, girl. The stars and the moon shine for us, girl. You are my Isis, I am your Cyrus, girl. My love, love. Baby, girl. You just gave me my love, love, love. Sweat, sweat, sweat for it. Love, love. Can't just give me my love. Let it go. Sweat it up. So many men that I dream of my love.
