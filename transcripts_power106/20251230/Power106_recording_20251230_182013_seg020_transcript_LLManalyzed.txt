20251230 182013 registered players from the diaspora, from the United Kingdom, United States. What are you seeing there in terms of numbers? We're not short in terms of numbers of players who are registered with us, you know. I didn't hear your question entirely, but if that's what you're asking me. We don't have a problem in that regard. As a matter of fact, we have close to 80 players registered with us from all over Canada and in the UK, and actually one or two from Europe. And if we were to go on another recruitment drive, we would be able to get, I would imagine, 20, 30 more players of good standing. I should mention that when we went to play in Montreal in July, there was a truck driver who came to the one practice session we had at 6 o'clock in the morning, only to tell us that he has a son, 18 years old, who is Jamaican, clearly, wants to play for Jamaica and brought him back to meet us. And that was unsolicited.
