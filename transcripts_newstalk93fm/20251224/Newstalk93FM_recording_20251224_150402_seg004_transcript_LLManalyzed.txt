20251224 150402 Look at people in the streets Chippin' down a lane It's how we break with the chain Come and taste our freedom, sweetie When you want your ways, look how you have in the places Hot and groovy, hope our music good to me It's happy in a jam again Feel like a movie, when you throw it back on me I feel feel no stress again. Every dirty night I wake up. Feeling really, really good. Thank you for letting me love you, baby. I didn't love you back then. Looked it back and now, now, now.
