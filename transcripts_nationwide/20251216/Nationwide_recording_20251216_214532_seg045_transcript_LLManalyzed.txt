20251216 214532 You can't have an experience and say nope, you're not going back. The man them worse. I think the men set out with the intention of just wanting to move. They don't go and then it's bad and they don't go back. They go with the intention. Most men go with just the one intention. Tell you what, if you said wanting to move. I'm just saying, in that particular instance, when a man is going to want to move a girl, he already decided he's going to. Like, he knew him no answer for anything more than just a little sex. Tell you what, if it was that good, he will go again. He'll go again. He's not going to have a relationship. Granted. Granted. But let me just go sideways. Let me just go sideways for a second. I concur, yeah, granted. I agree. Do you ever wonder how a man decided that you're a wanna move girl so I wouldn't know I wouldn't know girl I wouldn't know
