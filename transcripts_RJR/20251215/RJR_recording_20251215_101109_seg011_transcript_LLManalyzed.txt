20251215 101109 I'm playing to the authorities. Do not tell me about the hurricane. Because they were there before the hurricane. And they now get bigger after the hurricane. The patrols on Barney Street from Westgate took the fire station. It is caused, when the police are not on the road, it is caused day, night, afternoon, midday, all kind of mirror, the traffic. We need them to pull out, we need them to manage the traffic. Well, they're trying their best to manage the traffic, but these potholes and these major roads, they show some tone out of country. The EE's, you know, the one up on Long Hill, where they send the traffic, they kind of even it out a bit. But those, can we just deal with them? Can we deal with them? You have a lot of flow of traffic at Bay West Gate, the heavy flow of traffic. If you try to deal with some of them, you need to get a better flow. It's not the best, but a better flow. I hear you. You have to deal with that amount of urgency.
