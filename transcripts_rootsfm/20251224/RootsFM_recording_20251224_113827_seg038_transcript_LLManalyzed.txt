We can do this anyhow I and I will see you through Cause every day we pay the price We're delivering sacrifice We're chiming till the time is through We're chiming The thing that chiming was a thing of the past We're timing And I hope this time is gonna last No bullet will stop us now We need to beg or we won't bow Neither can be bought now so We all have learned the right to judge each other
