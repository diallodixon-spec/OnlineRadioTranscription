20251230 092012 I know I make some money outside, lover outside. But be sick when the girls get some outside, huh, honey. Bathing suit, body suit, trying to let this body loose. This tequila 90 proof, chasing with my juice. Heard them patrons got them, let me in the locker room. And some ladies out in Vegas, as your word was popping boo. Booty cheeks got a shake first, got some pain. Let me know the time and place. I'm just trying to ride this. PJKK, take me somewhere tropical. Spidey, I'm a super driver, kind of cute. When I tell you this, say shoot. Please believe me, they will on anything. This way too easy. Good for nothing, load on dirty dogs. I'm convinced. Every time you see your mama, tell her how she raised a boy. Out on the pop out, cause it's hot out You was playing games, but you on time out Where the font, you tryna find I been cuffed up too long, let me remind you I ain't see your car, I ain't hear a ring, I'm in the studio
