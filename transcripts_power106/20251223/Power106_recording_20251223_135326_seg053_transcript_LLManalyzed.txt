20251223 135326 What they're not saying is that the police have killed 400 people. No, no, no, no. The extrapolation I have is that they're going to kill slightly over 300 people this year, not 400, okay? If you add the 300, I'm going to replace the 400 with 300 because you need to have the correct information. If If you add the 300 killed to the police to the nearly 700, you're going to get 900 and something this year, which would still be lower. But I have raised a point before and it's a powerful point you've raised. In order for this to be sustainable, the police must cut back on their killings. State killings can't be close to 50%. It's going to be 40% of the homicide rate. The state homicide rate itself, the state homicide is going to dissipate.
