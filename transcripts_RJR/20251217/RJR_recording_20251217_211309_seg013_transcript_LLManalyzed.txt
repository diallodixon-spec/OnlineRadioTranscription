20251217 211309 Lady Monica, how you doing? Good evening, Cheetah. I got to say hi to Lady Marlene. Marlene Razzle, yeah. Also there in St. Elizabeth. My friend from Silo. How you doing? You're good to go? Lady Ali. Good evening once again, sis. Hope you're having a fantastic one. Lady Angie. Oh, you, you, you paid your last respects. To the big icon. Give me to the cliff. Nice.
