20251217 134938 No matter where I go, I'm not leaving. I said I'm not leaving Jamaica. In comes King Kabaka, lyrical champion. Watch me chop up the rhythm like a sword from Japan. So bright and full swing like a real Chinese man. Practitioner of yoga of yoga but not Indian lyrics them a weapon of mass destruction I have nuclear bomb like an American can't over stand like an Egyptian I'm a glyphic when I shift it to the fifth dimension when the rhythm not a fit me religion you get twist up and flat up like a Brazilian pile off your face with the mic in my hand Then sip a cup of tea like I come from England Long time no DJ, no dance Long time no chant, no dance I come from the area I come from Jamaica
