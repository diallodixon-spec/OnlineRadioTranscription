20251229 212819 I don't know about you, but I'm gonna be changed in a moment, in a twinkling of an eye, oh yes. Cause at the midnight cry, one of these days He's coming back for me. At the midnight cry, I can hardly wait till Jesus returns. Cause at the midnight cry. At the midnight cry. When Jesus, when Jesus, when Jesus comes home. Oh yeah. On a cloud of fallen children. He's gonna call the children. He's gonna call His children, The cherry-tribe surrender to me in the end.
