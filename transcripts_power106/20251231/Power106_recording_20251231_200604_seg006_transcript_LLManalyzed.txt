20251231 200604 The more of life I live to see, I feel more like a child The lessons that I have to learn, I know will take a while And if it takes eternity, I hope your plans for me Surround me with a gift of joy and make my days complete Embrace me with your love and help me rise above Show me the way to keep the faith so I won't forget to say that it all begins with you. The secret of life is walking closer to you.
