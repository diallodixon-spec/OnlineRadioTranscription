to a point where it's going to be mathematically impossible. In fact, maybe it is. No victory in all of 14 games. But there is something of a battle going on. Leeds just above that relegation zone, so anything could happen. Nottingham Forest also, not exactly a couple of defeats. Could see them hanging on by the skin of their teeth. to speak quick comment on that that he wants but I think that based on what he's coming and done that he'll be able to continue to steer them in the right direction. I think that Northern Forest will get out of the relegation zone by early next year, January, February and they should be okay. I think West Ham also may be able to get themselves out of the trouble based on what we saw from them
