20260102 191613 The story last year concerning the donation of, I don't want to call it aid, let me not call it aid, but the donation towards the hurricane militia relief effort from the Israelis. I have never, ever seen a story attract so many views, comments, interactions, shares. It breaks every social media record, certainly where we are concerned at Nationwide. I don't know if it's the same, but all of the media houses who carry this story. And it's just cool to show you that the world is one small village in real terms by virtue of this thing called the Internet and the World Wide Web. Because so many people who are plugged into what is happening or what happened in the Gaza ever since the October advance by Hamas and what they did and the response. And so many people have an opinion on the Israelis from pretty much all over the world.
