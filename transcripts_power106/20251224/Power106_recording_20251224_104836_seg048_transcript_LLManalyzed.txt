20251224 104836 Yes so you know again coming back to the whole issue of how are we going to move on from Melissa and you know and again we have to remind everyone that you know in another six seven months hurricane season will be here again. So we have to move swiftly. There was Beryl and before we even recovered from Beryl, the recession caused by Beryl, then there came Melissa. We can expect something as soon as possible. So time is not on our side. This is no time for politicking and division. This is a time for unity and taking a national approach because we are extremely vulnerable because of the underspending on our infrastructure. So just imagine Beryl created a problem infrastructure Melissa come wiped out a significant portion and just imagine another one coming before recovering from the disaster caused by Melissa so this is no time to play right yep so we need to do this as quickly as possible and stop the foolish politics
