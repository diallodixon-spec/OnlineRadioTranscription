20251225 145247 I wouldn't waste my time telling you not to watch But love is a flower that needs a sun in the rain A little bit of pleasure is worth a whole lot of pain If you learned this secret, how to forgive A lover and a better life, you're a little No pain, no gain, no gain No pain, no pain, no gain Anything worth having at all is worth working for and waiting for Some of my closest friends thought they had their pain on the string Just cause that man was bringing them flowers and candy and all kinds of gifts Some gifts are just to make him feel better while he's on this guilt trip About that that night that, oh, you know what I mean. Especially when you know you haven't been doing the things you should do. Think about it. What is the man trying to tell you? Sometimes flowers mean maybe we should just be friends. Do you get my drift? Hang if you can hang. No pain.
