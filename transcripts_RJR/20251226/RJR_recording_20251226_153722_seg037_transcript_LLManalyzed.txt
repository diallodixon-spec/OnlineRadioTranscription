20251226 153722 We love you from now to the next few lifetimes. I give thanks for every waste man. Fall apart, be potent, free up your space man. I feel like I have a leprechaun in all my pockets. And while the streams come through the universal pocket. We haven't sinned, we no star-crossed. And being us, I may guide you on my heart-pass. The two of us, we like heroes and psych psyche. To get away from the fight, we don't care if you're traumatized, you don't like it. A destiny for me, it ain't no pain on your foot. You deserve the life we love for you, so ain't I mature? Me no even need me here, you are inside the boat. It's only natural for this kid come home to the boat. There ain't nothing like a good love story. That brings tears to your eyes, and hope will make you better. Since you found that four-leaf clover.
