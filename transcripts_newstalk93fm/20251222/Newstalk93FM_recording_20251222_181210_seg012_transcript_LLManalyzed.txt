20251222 181210 Say I'm drowning alone and I'm lost in my feelings Somebody send me a sign cause you know that I need it Can't even come back to me cause you know you're my healing We all need love Together say we all need love So come and we're strong enough together No place I'd rather be Strong enough together Right now is our energy Strong enough together Only you can help me understand it
