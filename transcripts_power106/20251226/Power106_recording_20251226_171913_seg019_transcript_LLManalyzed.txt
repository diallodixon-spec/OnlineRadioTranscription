It's still malicious and grudged upon my people You see the dirty lifestyle The rest of them don't want it There's nothing in them system Of which they create all around They criticise their own hydronia They would catch a straw if they were to drown They're not different from those Scrooves and Pharisees who come around They're not different from those scribes and Pharisees who come around They're not syndicators Skylarks on the streets Flirting the towns They never do positive They find a joy making people business around I don't say odd
