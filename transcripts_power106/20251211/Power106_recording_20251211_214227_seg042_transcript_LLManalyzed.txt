2025-12-11 23:18:04 Christmas morning. I will be very disappointed. You know, you know, here in a Christmas, then you eat a lot of pork in Christmas. Christmas time, you get certain part of the pork feed by or you can't get the rest of the year. You have to go in a special shop. They call it a ribbet. If you pass up don't have to tell you where we're from either. I mean, you know, because you don't want nothing from nobody, so you know, no more argument with you. I work and make Christmas presents because I don't have money to buy nothing. When I have money, I give them Christmas food. But when I make Christmas presents, I push them.
