candle in each window hang your heart upon a shining Christmas tree have a Merry Merry Merry Merry Christmas just as Merry as it can be Sleigh bells ring, are you listening? In the lane, snow is glistening. A beautiful shine, we're happy tonight. Walking in a winter wonderland Gone away is the bluebird Here to stay is the new bird Who sings a love song as we go along
