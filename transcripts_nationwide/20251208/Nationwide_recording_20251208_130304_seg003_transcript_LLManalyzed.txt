Most of the content out there about parenthood is produced by women for women. So we think it is important that we be the change we want to see. Follow us on YouTube, Facebook, Instagram and Twitter at Jamaican dads with a Z and definitely join us here on nationwide 90 FM every Thursday at 8 PM with a repeat on Sundays at 6 PM for theican Dads podcast.
