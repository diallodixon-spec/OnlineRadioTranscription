20251224 153418 You can find me out on the road, I'm ready to walk. Just the word, time home tonight. Don't sign the party. Y'all don't send no third party to find me. I'm not gonna be home tonight. Not coming home tonight. So I don't think no third party can find me. I was grabbed by the melodies. Now the liquor take all of me. And the bass knock my soul out and make sure soca won't let me leave. I don't know if I'll survive. Some after some wine after wine. I go say strong and fit for life. Weak like the masses, kryptonite. You won't find me where I'm bound for shit.
