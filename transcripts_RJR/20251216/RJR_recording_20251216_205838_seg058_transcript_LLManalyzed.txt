20251216 205838 I think black salve is only used externally. But if you are planning on trying the black salve for an infection that you have, let us know what the outcome is. But always before you try anything at all, what are you going to do first, Mrs. G? What do I always say? Speak to your physician. Speak to your doctors about anything that you want to try before, because it might interfere with medications that you're on. It might interfere with delaying help that you need. And some things that you have going on are things that won't necessarily be able to just wait for a natural approach to kick in. Sometimes you have to just act quickly and decisively, medicinally. And then now we try to rebuild naturally. So we'll see how that works out. OK. And a special thank you is coming to you, Doc, from from Lady Y. And we also have Lady Andrea. Happy with her roses. Yes, yes.
