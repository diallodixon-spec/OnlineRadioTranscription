Another banger Baby calm down, calm down Girl this your body it put in my heart For lockdown, for lockdown, oh lockdown Girl you sweet like phantom, phantom If I tell you stay I love you no day know they from Yangau, she wear yellow Every other girl did they do too much, but this girl mellow Now you mind the fine situation, I go use the dollar mellow Finally I find way to talk to the girl, but she ain't no one for me
