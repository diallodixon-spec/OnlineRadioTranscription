============================================================

could sleep without you. Thinking of all the times we shared. I remember when my heart broke. I remember when I gave up loving loving you My heart couldn't take no more of you I was sad and lonely I remember when I walked out I remember when I screamed I hated you But somehow deep inside still loving you Sad and lonely No one knew All the pain I went through. All the love I say deep in my heart.
