20251230 212117 Wherever you go, I cry for your river That leads to your own atom You'll never see me fall apart And the words of a broken heart It's just emotion that's taking me over Tied up in sorrow, lost in my storm But if you don't come back, come home to me, darling Nobody left in this world to kiss goodnight And the words of a broken heart is just emotion that's taken me up Tied up in sorrow, lost in the storm
