20260102 191610 Take away this emptiness inside I'll turn away when friends will tell me I should come to you and surrender all my life Life was reckless till I obey them And find a church that I could go to set me free It was at the altar I cried Lord save me I felt the burden slowly lifting off my life My life was lost without You
