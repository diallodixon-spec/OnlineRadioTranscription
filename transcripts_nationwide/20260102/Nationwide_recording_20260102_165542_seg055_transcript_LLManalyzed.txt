I'm going to give the female best record female I want to give that to Spice I think that Spice really outperformed everyone this year musically I think did she drop an album this year no it was last year she dropped Miro and she has gotten a massive commercial success with Godonde God Godonde really hit milestones. I think it went gold and also one of the highest streamed for her on Spotify and it's in the top 5 for Shaggy and Sean Paul. So it did great numbers.
