A message from the Integrity Commission. Living the Vision is the end goal of the Vision 2030 initiative. Part of the goal is to live in a Jamaica where our youth are empowered to contribute meaningfully in building and strengthening the communities to which they belong. Head over to vision2030.gov.jm for full access to the Vision 2030 National Development Plan. You may also contact the Planning Institute of Jamaica at 876-960-9339. That's it for today's program. Join us next time when we'll highlight happenings round about JA. Until then, I'm Bon Davis with Studio Engineer Andre Sawyers. What good!
