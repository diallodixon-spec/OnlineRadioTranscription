20251215 201810 I am still here Oh Lord, I am still here See you wake up in the morning, started on my knees Thanking my Father for shielding me Though my burdens are heavy My trials are great But I have a savior So I live by faith So I'm still here, I'm still here Though the devil tried to kill me I'm still here God held me in his arms
