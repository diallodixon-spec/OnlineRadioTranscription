Both Wegovi and Ozempec, which mimic the hormone GLP-1, are given as weekly injections. According to Nova Nordisk, the WegoV pill showed roughly similar weight loss and side effects in clinical trials as WegoV shot and will be available by prescription in the U.S. in January. The starting dose will cost $149 for patients paying out of pocket under an agreement announced in November with the Trump administration.
