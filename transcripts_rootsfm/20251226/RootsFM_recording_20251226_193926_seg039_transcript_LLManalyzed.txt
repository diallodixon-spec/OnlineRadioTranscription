20251226 193926 I'll wait for the 26th I can't wait, I can't wait I can't wait for Boxing Day No magic in the lights and snow No love under the mistletoe No joy for me in going broke When there's nothing that we need You call it a holiday But when it's done I'll need a break From all the smiles I know are fake I can't wait for Boxing Day I can't wait I can't wait For Boxing Day
