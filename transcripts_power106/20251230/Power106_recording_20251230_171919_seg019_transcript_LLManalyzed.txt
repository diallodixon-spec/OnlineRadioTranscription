20251230 171919 SUV market upside down. After analyzing real owner data, four SUVs emerged with near perfect scores, and the number one pick shocked everyone. What's even more surprising? Three of these vehicles are quietly pushed aside by dealerships because they last too long and make less money in service. Today, we're counting down from number four to number one, and each pick gets more uncomfortable for the industry. And when we reach the top spot, even the engineers didn't see it coming. Let's start with number four. Number four, Subaru Outback. There's a reason this vehicle quietly ends up in the driveways of mechanics and engineers. The Subaru Outback isn't officially an SUV, it's a raised wagon, but Consumer Reports groups it with SUVs because of its ground clearance and real-world capability. And this is where it gets interesting. Outback owners are unusually loyal. About 87% replace their Outback with another one. That level of repeat buying is almost unheard of in the auto industry.
