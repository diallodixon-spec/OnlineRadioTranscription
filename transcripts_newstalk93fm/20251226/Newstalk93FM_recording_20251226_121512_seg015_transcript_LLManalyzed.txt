20251226 121512 We're punching that's automatic I have a lightning jumbie A kind of energy inside me And it ready for the rum, ready ready for the rum Ready ready for the rum ready for the action A spiritual encounter In me soul taking over Telling me to start up the drinking And do away with good behaviour So we out on the road now It's Mars and Riddim and Soka And I'm ready for the rum, ready, ready for the rum Ready, ready, for the rum Ready for the action, boom! The sweating spirit of me feeling good! I have a lightning spirit Early in the morning I hat it Me cooler ready, me heist done ready Me punching that's automatic I have a lightning jumbie A kind of energy inside me And it ready for the rum, ready, ready for the rum
