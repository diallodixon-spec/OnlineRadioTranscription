20251231 202619 Now you won't floor the time. Now you're so round and thick. Slim waist, pretty face, you floor the pine. So you ain't got to pay for drinks no more. Because I done found what I've been looking for all along. I'm talking about where they rang everything. Oh niggas, where they babe? As I take name to my love language. Let them say what they say. They're about to be like out of the day. Get mappin' in the club. I'm talkin' about swimming in vitamins. You can get a damn fitting in the back of my truck for me. Don't take your love for me. Clearly, you need a club oven. You need a club oven, get a label oven. Baby, I'm over something. You make me want to touch something. Smack it up, flip it and rub from me. Don't take your love from me. I'm your rubber man.
