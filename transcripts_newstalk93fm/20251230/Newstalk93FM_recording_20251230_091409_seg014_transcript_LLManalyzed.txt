20251230 091409 I have a lightning jumbie, a kind of energy inside me And it ready for the rum, ready, ready for the rum Ready, ready, for the rum Ready for the action, a spiritual encounter In me soul taking over Telling me to start up the drinking And do away with good behaviour So let we go, let we go down the road Let we go, it's action time, let we go It's's back-and-on time, there we go. Hands up. What? Oh. Oh, oh. Oh.
