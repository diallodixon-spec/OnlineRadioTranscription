What song could sing And bring glory to the God above Full of truth and endless love He who is and was and always will be I surrender to the one, gentle and most powerful Of all the things you are, you've chosen to be a savior to me. You have made the light to shine through the darkness of all time. And that light was life In the face of Jesus Christ He calls the dawn within my soul My heart no longer is my own I want to praise you now With every breath I breathe
