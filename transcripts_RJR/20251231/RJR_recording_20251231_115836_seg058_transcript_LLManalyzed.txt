But we know for sure that we did not make it alone or in our own strength. Your guiding hands were always there even though it was sometimes difficult to see them we give you thanks and praise that your gift of life in us has been kept secured we remember with a sense of loss yet hope for those who left our company on this earth during the, and pray that they may find eternal rest in your safekeeping. We pray this in your loving and precious name, O Lord. Amen.
