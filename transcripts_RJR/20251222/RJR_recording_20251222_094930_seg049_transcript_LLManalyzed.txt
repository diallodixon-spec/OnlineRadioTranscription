20251222 094930 Rabbit capitalism relates mostly to quantity, while socialism relates to quality. And therefore, if there is a higher quality in the less work time, then of course I should pay equal amount, because it balances the economic space, right? There's a quantity, yes, but that quantity at some point, maybe I'm going to lose a percentage while the less-overused produce a higher quality. Therefore, I regain what I lost in the bulk production back from the quality production. So, you know, it is interesting because what it raises is issues of not just philosophy, religion and economics copped up in all of this. So thank you for throwing it in there, if it was not a thing. All the best to you, Liz.
