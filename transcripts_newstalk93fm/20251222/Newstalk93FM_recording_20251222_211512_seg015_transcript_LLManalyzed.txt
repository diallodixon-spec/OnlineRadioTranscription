20251222 211512 Right back till the morning. Turn up the music, make me rock and come in. Right back til the morning. When you speak to me, I hear a song Every word you say feels like a poem I will take you with me everywhere Listen to you every day Oh, oh, sweet inspiration. When I feel like I can't do what I'm supposed to. And I can't even pick myself up out of bed. You come around with so much love.
