That's Inflation Watch, looking at the factors influencing price change in the Jamaican economy. Right here on Radio Jamaica 94 FM, every last includes a simple act, washing your hands. Use soap and safe water to remove dirt and germs after cleaning, before eating, and after using the toilet. If clean water is limited, use hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Remember, clean hands stop the spread of disease and help to keep families safe. A message from the Ministry of Health and Wellness.
