in common, then an estate would have been created, separate shares, then you would have to apply for probate. But again, if it's a joint tenancy scenario, one person dies, you do not apply for probate, you simply do an application to note that person's death. I think a lot of persons make that mistake. They think that once you have a will, once someone dies, you must apply for probate. If all they have is a property owned with someone jointly, meaning they owned as joint tenants, you don't have to apply for probate, you simply note their debt. What's the fee to have a lawyer keep your will? I don't know that there is a fee. We certainly don't charge a fee to keep violence wild. And I would hasten to say, I don't quote me on this, but I would think that most attorneys probably do not charge a fee. I could be wrong though, and I stand to be corrected.
