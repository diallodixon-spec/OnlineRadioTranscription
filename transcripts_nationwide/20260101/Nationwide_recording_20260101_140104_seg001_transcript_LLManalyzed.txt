20260101 140104 Just one night And we'll have the magic feeling like we used to do Hold on tight And whatever comes our way, we're gonna make it through Seems believing it's worth the wait So hold me and tell me it's not too late We're sober together, we're starting forever now And I miss you like crazy I miss you, like crazy No matter what I say to you They're just the best of you And I miss you, I miss you All the tears of love
