============================================================

all will be treasured if i gave my heart to you Every time you come around, I see my world start turning up to dirty. And I just can't find the meaning, baby. I want to listen to this love of mine seeming missing. And don't hurt me, because I'm falling away again. I'm awake. Well Well sometimes I just can't call this peace But I have to pinch myself to be shown That this love is more than I can endure
