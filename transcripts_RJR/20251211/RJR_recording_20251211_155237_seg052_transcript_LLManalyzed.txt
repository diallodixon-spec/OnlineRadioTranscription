2025-12-11 17:00:33 We'll be in Harmony Beach Park on Saturday. And I gather we have about a little over 30 clans here today. I gather it's over 40 clans in Mubia. And remember, remember where the hurricane hit, right? And I hear that we need to be prepared because there are other people who want to be on the list. And it makes my heart feel full because this is what we want. We don't want people to sit down and weep and moan. Yes, bad things happen, but you know, it's the good things that come out of it. Absolutely. And I'm looking forward to that. We'll be having my team on the ground introducing, you know, new things to them and all of that. Plus we're having a little entertainment. What is Jamaica without entertainment? We is very entertaining myself. I have to say I have to say to the viewers and the listeners that all the vendors here today are here compliments of Sagicor. Yes, we are. Not a dollar spent. Not a dollar sent. Not a dollar. Love it. And I mean. But who are plenty dollars for spending on the girl today?
