Good evening to our friends on YouTube. We invite you to also weigh in live in the comment section on today's public opinion. Today's public opinion takes us to a compound because Maroon Chief Richard Curry says he's rejecting the offer by Prime Minister Dr. Andrew Holness to deploy soldiers from the Jamaica Defense Force JDF to assist with the rebuilding efforts in the Maroon Village. Curry made the announcement last week in a video posted to his social media pages. of the space during the recovery effort. The full Maroon Council instead has resolved to continue with response utilizing civilian resources from our joining communities and our partners both locally and internationally who have offered to them to the community their assistance in the recovery.
