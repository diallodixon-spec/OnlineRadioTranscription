Waved like I never waved. Wired like I never wanted to. Just to show you I'm sorry. I'm sorry. And I need you back in my life. You got people by the truck. Em running high We are not in the sky Death running down we hide Can't you tell that we're sorry? We're sorry And we need you back in we hide I need you back, come back Come on to me, come on to me Come Come on to me. It's time to bless the Lord. Come to me, come to me. Come to me.
