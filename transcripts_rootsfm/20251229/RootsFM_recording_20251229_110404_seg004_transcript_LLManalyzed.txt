20251229 110404 despite the fact that we have gone through a devastating period during October. Some persons are still at that place, but importantly, we have life. So here on Beyond the Prescription, we have experts who will take us beyond the medication and help us to understand our health. And this is on a Monday between 11 a.m. and 12 noon. There's also a rebroadcast on a Wednesday at 6.30 p.m. To all my listeners, welcome, and I hope that you will be educated and informed today. Later in the program, we also have a special feature, maybe that's my favorite part of the program because I'm not the one talking at that time, where we'll have prayer by Bishop Dr. Michael Webster.
