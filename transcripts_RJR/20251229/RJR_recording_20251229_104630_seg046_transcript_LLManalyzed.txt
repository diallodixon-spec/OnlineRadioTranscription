20251229 104630 Let me tell you, I am telling you from experience with somebody, I cry till I don't have tears left in my eyes. When I sit on the chair, I have to be leaning down on other patients that I don't know, and I just say it because it's a pain. That's why I'm just looking somewhere to relax, to sit back right now. Right now the pain is like across my chest. I went there sort of blowing shards because this is all the pain. And if Dr. Vaughan is listening, he can correct me. I think, I mean, cyclists in severity need oxygen at the same time. All they do is give me oxygen.
