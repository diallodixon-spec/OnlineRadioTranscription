20251222 092514 Another call. Good morning. Welcome to Hotline. This is Clive Mullings. Good morning Sir Mullings. Morning. How you doing? I'm not doing bad. Before I go into what I want to talk about, let me just wish everyone, everyone a peaceful and wonderful Christmas and whatever they are doing, they remember the reason for the Christmas. They will not forget Christ inadvertently out of their Christmas. I just also remember those who are going through a hard time now, our prayers will be with them and if we can give, we give. Some say, okay, I can give cash, I'm kind, but we can give prayers. And so, you know, I just want to wish everyone a wonderful time.
