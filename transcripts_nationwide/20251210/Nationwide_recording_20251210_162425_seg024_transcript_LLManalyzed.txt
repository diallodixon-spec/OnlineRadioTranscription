He looked older. You're like, you know, grand thing. But bigger per se, you'll see when you're younger. I don't know if you're listening to the show, but bigger per se. But then he said, he used to go to JSC. You know what I'm saying? He's not from me either. You know, I'm just like, oh yeah. He's like, yeah man, I'm your friend man.
