20251216 122623 I can wash it too And there is no bad mine on the road They shall slowly fade away, ah Then look how long we tell them to stop fight Ken Sonny did enough for them to come and act like Them are your brother, all them good poppin' backbite Watch them kill the pretties, who them a go Go show them colours like a stoplight Them colour than a frostbite Them hearts, it's covered with a scotch brine. They need a whole reservoir of jelly water to wash off the mat. That could do only on the back, but not the stand, right? And they shall slowly fade away And I know nothing I can watch with hope The meditation is so blind to hope And they shall slowly Fade away Well granny tell me friend, don't sleep So from the garden there you sleep Friend we don't sleep
