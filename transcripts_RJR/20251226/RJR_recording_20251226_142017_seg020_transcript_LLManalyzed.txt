20251226 142017 They call it me a hooligan, a hooligan. They call it me hooligan. A habond, a vagabond, vagabond. I don't even take off my shirt yet, I don't even roll on the tongue yet, I do even whine under your lips, and they calling me a hooligan. I don't drink out half of this pot, I don't push on no barrier, I'm riding on you, you jacks, so you're shagged. Yes, I am a vagabond! Cause it's cold, yeah! Those vagabonds! We got a mission on the road that take the cash all day! We're vagabonds! It's priority to mash up the party! Those vagabond dance, yeah! And we goin' up above all day long!
