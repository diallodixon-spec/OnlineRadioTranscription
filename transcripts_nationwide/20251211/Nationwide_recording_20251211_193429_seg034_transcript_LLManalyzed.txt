I'm not going so far. But it seems he's putting in the work to, he's had some rough edges. He's a very charismatic gentleman. I think he's recognized that in order to go further in terms of political careers, he has to smooth out some of those rough edges. I think there will be a far, far more effective opposition if they continue on the same job. Because in my view, in the parliament, they were the better side. They were the better side on Tuesday. I don't know if I want to go so far. I don't want to be mean. I think it's not so much that they were the better side. I just think the other side was let down, so to speak. By who? I'm not going to go any further.
