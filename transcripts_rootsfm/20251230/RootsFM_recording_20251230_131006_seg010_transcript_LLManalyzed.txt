20251230 131006 Hey Crabwalking Jamrock, I am so proud of you my brother.. You're singing up a storm like y'all them long time singer. But you saw how long time y'all sing still, you know? So you don't know me bread drain. Y'all gone good. Make sure you come to some more Musbus early January morning. Remember me tell you, more Musbus to say, you know, from Crab walking, you know. More Musbus for your bus. You might owe some note like Luciana. Luciana coming up next. Featuring Madeleine. It's called Rise. Give thanks and praise.
