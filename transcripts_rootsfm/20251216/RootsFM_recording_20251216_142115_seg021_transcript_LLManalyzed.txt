20251216 142115 My baby is gone, leaving me lonely. All I'm thinking of is my baby and me. Of those days, how we used to be. Right now, I'm lonely. I'm not happy. My baby is gone. He walked out on me. All that is left is just memories My baby is gone, gone. Now I'm in search of her love. And I decide to serve her. Wake up truly, wake up, wake up. I don't say me word when I see word.
