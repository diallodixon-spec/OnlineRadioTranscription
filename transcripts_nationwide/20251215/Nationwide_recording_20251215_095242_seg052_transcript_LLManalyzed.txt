So we want to make sure that that's not the situation here because that's a no-no. However, if it's like your mother or father had filed for you while you were single, you migrated, that's the key. You have to have landed in the United States, migrated, then you can turn right around the very next day and go back to Jamaica or wherever your country of origin or wherever you choose. And yes, you can then marry your spouse. But like the other caller, because you're only a green card holder, there might be a backlog. There's going to be a little wait before you'll be able to transfer residency to that person. So it might take about two or three years. So don't let the person come here and run off on
