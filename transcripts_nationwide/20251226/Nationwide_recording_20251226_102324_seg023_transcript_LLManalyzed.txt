20251226 102324 So many nights I long to hold you So many times I long time for your face Nothing could change the way I feel No one else could ever take my place I'm every human, I'm a patient type of man I'm a true human, forced to make mistakes I'm the one to be make mistakes Don't stay too long Pretty baby, I know you're working hard for me Don't stay way to long Pretty baby, save me your breath
