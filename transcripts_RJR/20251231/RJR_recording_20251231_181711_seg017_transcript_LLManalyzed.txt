20251231 181711 was a gentleman who said get off my lawn, looking at me head to toe and said that I did not belong in the community. Same kind of attitude when I got to City Hall, but it was more of a professional environment. No, but before you reach there, how could you react to something like that happen? Because you know, in Jamaica, we have lots of stuff, but we don't have that. I did not believe that racism existed until that very moment. You lie. Yeah, I did not believe. Because you grew up in Jamaica, and you hear about prejudice, but not racist, right? So I was saying, yeah, everybody loves everybody, you know, that sort of stuff. You know, I was living in Miami Beach before I moved to Tamarack. People were nice to me, you know, so I didn't think that racism existed until that moment. Really and truly, that did not break my spirit. It was my very first door.
