20251226 180808 I'm still in love with you It might really take my love to show you How much my love is true The feeling she gave to me Makes me feel so brand new I love you forever and There's no other like you This is so special I tell you girl For someone special Living in my world It's only for you The things that I do, ooh, baby Girl, open your eyes and let love through Like every whole ocean shows up Where the rivers run to, back to the arms of the cure
