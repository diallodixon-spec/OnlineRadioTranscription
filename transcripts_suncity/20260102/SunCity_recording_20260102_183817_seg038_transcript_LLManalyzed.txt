20260102 183817 Too many distractions, too many problems I finna run away but I won't go stop them Too many bad men and nothing but friends Lots to save me, don't wanna lose my conscience I just wanna been before Make nobody stress me, not to stop me, cha-cha-cha I sip my alcohol, I don't wanna miss the bad things no more I don't wanna come back to where I'd been before Make nobody stretch me, not to start me, ja-ja-ja
