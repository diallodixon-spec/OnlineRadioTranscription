I think that Vauxhall has been one of the surprise packages this season. They're into the quarterfinal round and I'm very pleased for them. They've been very focused, very determined and the work that they've put in over the summer to get to where they are now, you can't begrudge them. They've really worked for their place in the final eight and I'm very happy for them and for Carl Butler and what they've been able to do with that program. All right, very good news. All right, time for English Premier League. Let me go to the tables very quickly on the table. Arsenal out in front after 14 rounds, 33 points. Manchester City five points behind on 28. Aston Villa in the dogfight as well. 27 points to be third. Chelsea in fourth. And some distance on the pace now. And then we have behind that Crystal Crystal Palace 23 points to be fifth. Sunderland still doing pretty well in a European spot in sixth position. Let's see what's happening at the bottom of the table. West Ham in 18th. Burnley in 19th. Wolves
