20251231 165926 Big, big tune by the Queen. Earlier I played the King and I played the Prince of Reggae. This is the Queen. We have yet to crown the Princess. I feel like it should be Alain or Leela. I'm not lying, I'm not lying. The two of them, it's hard. It's hard to choose who should be the Princess. And these are my nominations. You probably have other nominations, but I believe it should either be Alain or Leila Ike.
