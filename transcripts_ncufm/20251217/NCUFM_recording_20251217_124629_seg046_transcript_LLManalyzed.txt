20251217 124629 Today's quote says Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away. That's in Matthew 24 verse 35 While everything in life is fragile and shifting or plans or possessions even the world itself God's Word remains the one unshak foundation. This verse calls us to anchor our hope not in what is temporary, but in what is eternal. When storms rise and voices fade, His promises still stand, offering us stability and peace. It is a gentle but powerful reminder that no matter how uncertain life feels, God's Word endures. And when we cling to it, we endure too.
