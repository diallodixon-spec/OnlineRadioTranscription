The Jamaican sounding fresh. You know, body bunty, watch you glow Pretty girl, never hide and see Now eat your pickle breeze, watch you snap it from me Said if you're a badda badda badda girl You should know one another, man Call her my brada brada brada, brada girl You should show her for her to understand Where she at? The best body in the West Indies The best body in West Indies Body never dead like West Indies Peace, come over here Relax, come in and do that Cause me a love your good and your man could not play Me die in your warm like house
