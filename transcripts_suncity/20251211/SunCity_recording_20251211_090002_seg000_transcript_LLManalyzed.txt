Yeah, man, love me. Guys, that is our time for today on this Cape and Hardware Lovers Thursday. Guys, love each other. Love each other. Raise these kids, co-parent these kids, all right? That's the aim in society right now. Love the kids, then put out love and more love. And if your man or your ex-woman admires somebody, it's in your best interest to learn and get to know the person. If you see if the person is a real person, so you can't tell the ex how you know. So I don't think that man is good for you. I don't think the woman is good for you or around the kids. You have to do something with them. When they don't think, when they don't think. But guys, enjoy the rest of your day. Coming up next is the Hello Jamaica team. Alright, we'll be back tomorrow. Same time, same place for a turn up Friday. It is your girl Raven saying stay safe and as always, crazy Dean. Wow, good peeps. It is now nine o'clock.
