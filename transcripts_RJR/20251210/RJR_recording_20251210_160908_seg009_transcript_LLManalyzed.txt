============================================================

we go hard at all. Thought we had something strong. You pulled my world out from under me. Loved what you've done to me. How could you end it this way? After the love that we've made. That's how I wish you had stayed. Can't you see that? I just want you back, dear. Wasn't I good to you? Didn't all that I could do to make you want to be here with me? I want you to love me. I me again? You could just turn and leave. You did it so easily. You pulled my world out from under me. Look what you've done to me before.
