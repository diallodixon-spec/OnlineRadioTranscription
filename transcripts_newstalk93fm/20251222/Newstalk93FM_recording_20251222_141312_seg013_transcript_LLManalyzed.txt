Jam to a rhythm in the heat. I can't eval, I'm in the heat, hey. But we gonna do now, start a wine on it. I say, compromise on it. Baby, spend time on it. Hey, I say, compromise for me. Hey, can we talk some business? You know, I want your company. And there's nothing too risky. Limited liability. Don't worry. If you try all the things I like, you could still be shy in the morning. So don't feel away. You don't like the fast life but look on the bright side girl i go take the blame i just want you come and rise it up just a little ride now come and meet me
