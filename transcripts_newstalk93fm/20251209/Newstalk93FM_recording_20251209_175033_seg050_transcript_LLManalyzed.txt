I've been drinking more, oh for the past five days Did you check on me? Now did you look for me? I walked in the room, eyes are red and I don't smile But now, did you check on me Now did you notice me? I've been drinking more, all for the past five days Did you check on? Now did you look for me? I walked in the room, eyes are red and I don't smoke banda Did you check on, did you check on?
