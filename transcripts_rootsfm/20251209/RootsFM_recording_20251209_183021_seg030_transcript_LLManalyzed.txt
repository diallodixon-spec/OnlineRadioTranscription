============================================================

Don't come to me. Just fill me up. All of my lonely life, I dream of you. Dream of you. You're like a baby. I wish I'm true. So many times I tried to let you know I'm glad you're mine But still it's hard to see the burning flame inside of me Cause I love you Why should I leave you? If I love you, why should I leave you if I love you? Why should I leave? Maybe I failed to make you understand How much you mean to me, you're part of every class
