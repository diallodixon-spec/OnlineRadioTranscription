And you know the great thing about it is, he's a minister, and he's an MP, and he also has a skill set of playing music. And I don't know if it's still challenging to play music, you know. It is always good for them to know that, you know, there are so many persons out there who are doing well that play music to understand that this can be a successful and very good career path. If you understand it, if you understand how to do the voice and speech, your presentation, your diction, selecting songs, playing responsibly, because that's a big part of what we do as a radio station. So instead of knowing that these youths have the skills and they can play, we're guiding them for them to understand a certain song. No, this is what you need to be doing because you're setting the tone in whatever area that you go and you can also continue to develop yourself as a youth
