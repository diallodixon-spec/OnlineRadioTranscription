20251224 214929 Let's go. I was like, good gracious, ass bodacious, flirtatious, trying to show patience. I'm swinging for the right time to shoot my Steve. You know, swinging for the right to flash them keys. And I'm leaving, please believe in me and the rest of my heathens. Checking out a lot of the top of the four seasons. Penthouse, rooftop, birds are feeding. No deceiving, nothing up for sleeping. No teasing. I need you to get up up on the dance floor. Get that man Woody asking for it. Cause I feel like busting loose and I feel like dancing.
