20260101 184220 I was ripping through the streets, it was hard for her Now I'm up in hotels on the ocean shore When I was sleeping on the floor, took on the star But I made it, and I made me I know I did wrong, I praise the God he would save me Cause I made it, he didn't kill me So it made me strong, I pray this night that you feel me Oh from the beginning When the world wasn't listening Now that I got your teaching Let us sing the irrigation Bottle after bottle, snatching belly out the bucket Lighting on my wounds for these homies out here thuggin' Pray for benediction, pretty women know my prayer
