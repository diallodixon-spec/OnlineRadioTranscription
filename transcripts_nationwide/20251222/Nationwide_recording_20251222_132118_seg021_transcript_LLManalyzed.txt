20251222 132118 But for me, just another day They all gather round me They seem to know my name We laugh, tell a few jokes But it still doesn't ease my pain I know I can't hide from a memory Though day after day I've tried I keep saying she'll be back, but today again I lied. Oh, I see my miss everywhere I go. On the street and even at the picture show. Have you seen her? Tell me, have you seen her? Oh, I hear my voice as the cold winds blow. In the sweep, music on the radio Have you seen her? Tell me, have you seen her? Why, oh why, don't you have to leave and go away?
