20251223 161609 Why do you look so vexed this early? They didn't just start. Lisa, it is so good to see you. But sorry you catch me like this, girl. My uncle sent one bar along when my family got for clarity. You don't want to hear the cries of the people they put on or something. But the matter is worse, me hear say half of the thing they missing. And me know say a customs. Girl, how you know say a customs? Lisa stop going like you don't have no sense, man. You know say say everybody has talked about it in the media. You don't want me to stop listening to you, sir? You ever experience that? Customs don't go into your package, suitcase, barrel or cargo unless you ship the item or the agent stand up right there when they inspect it. Listen, customs' job is to protect the borders, collect revenue and to facilitate trade. They don't collect or store shipment, they inspect it and somebody has to present it for inspection. So how Customs ever get so much cost in them? Tracy, and are Customs alone involved in the clearance?
