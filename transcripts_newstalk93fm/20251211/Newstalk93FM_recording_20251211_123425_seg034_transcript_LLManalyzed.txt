It's on the way And baby, I did have been a little superstitious The curse on me was broken by your magic wand Seems to me that you and me, we make our own luck New hype, manhood, I gotta knock on wood All of that miscellaneous shit my eyes redwood tree it ain't hard to knock on wood Forgive me, it sounds cocky He hypnotized me and opened my eyes Redwood tree, it ain't hard to see His love was the key that opened my skies
