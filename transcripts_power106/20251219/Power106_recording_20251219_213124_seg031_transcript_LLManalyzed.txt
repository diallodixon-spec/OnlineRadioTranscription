20251219 213124 I was born in Lurrock Had a childhood sweetheart We were always hand in hand I wore high-top shoes and shirt tails Shoes with walls and pigtails. I knew I loved her even then. You know, my papa disapproved it. My mama booed it. Well, I told them time and time again. Don't you know I was made to love from a world all around her She's been my inspiration, showed appreciation For the love I gave her through the years Like the sweet magnolia tree
