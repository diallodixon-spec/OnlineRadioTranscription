better this is power power 106 chestnuts roasting on an open fire jackfruits nipping at your nose Yuletide carols being sung by a choir and folks Dressed like Eskimo, everybody knows A turkey and some mistletoe Help to make the season bright Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow Will find it hard to sleep tonight
