20251212 125225 Big up me general, DJ Weedseed on Sun City Radio. This is Jack from Clean Bandit. The silence is slowly killing me Oh yeah Girl, you really got me bad You really got me bad Now I'm gonna get you bad Gonna get you bad Your salty skin and how it mixes in with mine The way it feels to be completely intertwined But that I didn't care, that I didn't know It's not what I didn't feel, it's what I didn't show So let me feed, and I'll set you free I am in misery
