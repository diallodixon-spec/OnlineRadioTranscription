20251229 203222 I'm on enjoyment Dispense you out Turn the silk down Only one of you out Everyday party out I said there's nothing I can do Start with the move, start with the move Like you smoke a la, just bounce with the groove, not how you do If you lose guard then go bounce with your boo, I can vouch for my crew I'm telling you, until they do, lifestyle of a crew Like you dance to the look, don't go deluge, don't go de-luge That's if it's not enough If I do 99 goody goody, then what? I don't know how to show you my love
