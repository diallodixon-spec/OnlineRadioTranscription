for you to know. The link will be at three o'clock. If you want for me to link a family member of Reginald or a sister in, it is as easy as ABC. Call me up and I will ask you who's the link. And then you can give me the individual names and of course the telephone number to the person you want me to link. Probably that individual having what we call a birthday'll be having a celebration in terms of anniversary. You called me up and let me know what's happening. The link will be at three o'clock. Yes, I want for you to be a part of that reality. We're going to be dropping our first Root Screech coming up at 3.30, then at four o'clock. Hey, the big one going to be on courtesy of the Musbus promotion. Say if you're young and talented and you're seeking a break in the music biz and don't know what to do or where to turn, right here is the place for you to do so. For more information, please drop by the studios of Roots Radio, Kirov, one mile drive, Kingston, 11 Jamaica. Give us a call
