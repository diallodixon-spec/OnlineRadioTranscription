20251212 151510 When the rain pits a pot on the roof Herb just a steamed pepper pot on the stew Like it's a dream if you got gratitude So go tell the regime they can't stop where we do Now, information you think on your own Or else you're a slave to the things that you know what do you know if you learn every day so be careful of things where you say I love to my friends and foes, and I suppose I'm pleased to be chilling in the West Indies Just provide all I want and need I got the sunshine, rivers and trees, really good Africa in our soul, but Jack in our heart It is of importance
