2025-12-12 14:24:25 I'll be your shoulder when you cry. I hear your voices when you call me. I am your angel. And when all hope is gone, I feel no matter how far you are, I feel it makes no difference who you are, I am your angel. When we turn out the lights, the two of us alone together, some it's just not enough.
