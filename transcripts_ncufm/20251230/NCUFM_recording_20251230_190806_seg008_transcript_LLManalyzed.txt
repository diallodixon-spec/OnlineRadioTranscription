20251230 190806 Honestly, sometimes I feel so lonely And now I've never got this walking with me I say once in a footprint, then I say It was God always hearing me Don't call me out, yet I'm still running I felt no better than God at fighting My eyes are on God's kingdom always And I won't stop until I finish this race. Don't hang me out yet, I'm still running. Well done, but I finish this race. You said you're never alone. You're never alone. God sees the tears that you cry. Don't worry, it's gonna be alright. You said it's impossible. It's impossible.
