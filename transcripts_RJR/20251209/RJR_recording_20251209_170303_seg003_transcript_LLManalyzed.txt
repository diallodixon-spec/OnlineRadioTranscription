jamaican94fm.com. Chairman of the PAAC Peter Bunting has expressed concern about some of the findings in their oversight investigation into the operations of the government to include the Melissa recovery efforts. Mr. Bunting says there were various deficiencies identified by the PAAC. The PAAC report was tabled today. Among the issues he raised was a breach in fiscal reporting on an interim fiscal policy paper. He says the report was tabled more than two months late in breach of the Financial Administration and Audit Act. Mr. Bunting also raised concern that the government has shifted resources away from capital projects at a time when road infrastructure and public facilities are in need of repair. The third supplementary estimates reflect a substantial increase of 106.3 billion in overall expenditure, with over 53.5 billion earmarked for Hurricane Melissa recovery efforts.
