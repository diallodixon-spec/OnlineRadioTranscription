20251217 181814 Nobody loves you bad So don't give in till you change mine Cause I'll be here for a lifetime You don't have to pretend to bow Because it's Christmas with Nana Guess it's bye to the good times And I'll be gone by the sunrise I'll be better on my own I'll be better off on my own, na-na Nobody should call my phone Nobody to call my phone, na my phone This is my last heartbreak song I'll be good all on my own Now everybody go to have breakfast. Shio. Shio.
