observed about Indian or Bangladesh Parliament, simply because you don't live there. What is your point, Beresford? I don't know. Should one of Dr. Gale's students be able to write a thesis on crime in New Zealand? Sometimes things get lost in translation when it's a written thing. So Beresford, first of all, what point did I make that you don't see? So that maybe I'd have a better understanding of what you've just posted. Because I don't understand what you're saying. I'm reading your previous message to see if there's something in there. I don't know what it's about. Is it something that my response to Matt qualified so that I understand what you're saying? Because quite frankly, no, I do not.
