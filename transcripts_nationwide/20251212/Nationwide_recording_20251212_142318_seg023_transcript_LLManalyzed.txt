2025-12-12 14:56:21 I haven't thought to call you before And why is it I haven't seen you around anymore Another year has passed and I can't erase The memory of your smiling face So I had to call you up and say, gee whiz, it's Christmas. So don't, so don't, the party that we're throwing nationwide tonight in M.F.F. Christmas time is here It's the jolly good time of the year People somehow know The Christmas spirit they show
