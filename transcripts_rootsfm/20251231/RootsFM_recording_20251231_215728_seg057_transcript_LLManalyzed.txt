20251231 215728 Goodbye to you. No matter how I try, you're such a part of me. Without you, I would die, deep in the heart of me. I know that you and I are meant to be forever. I can't tell you goodbye Neither of us planned that we would go on like this way But since we did, why should we be apart? Sometimes, some things happen that can never be explained Now it's too late for me, I've already given you my heart
