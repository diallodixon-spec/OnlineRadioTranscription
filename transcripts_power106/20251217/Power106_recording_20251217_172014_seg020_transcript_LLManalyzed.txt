20251217 172014 stranded and you know I was listening to a news report this morning where somebody hit a pothole this is this is you know just somebody hit the pothole and was left stranded in the road and this is a visitor to the country and you're left stranded in somewhere that you don't know in a dark area we don't want anything like that happening to any of us so battery terminals are not expensive, they're not hard to check and I would just implore everybody to just ensure that your battery terminals are not fuzzy, they're securely tightened on the battery, not loose. The other thing is ensure your battery is not sloshing around in the vehicle. Every battery has a clamp and we have seen several cars come here without clamps and we have to be putting on clamps. So we want to ensure that our vehicles have the clamp for the battery so the battery is not moving up and down. Why? It is dangerous. It can shorten the life of the battery and it can literally catch a car on fire.
