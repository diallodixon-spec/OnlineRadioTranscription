20260101 155334 I'm all right and the same thing with Dennis too. So that's why everything developed. But when we could start down, we would decide to own a living world. You can realize that things can change and sometimes you play something for a producer and don't like him, get somebody overdubbed and you don't have any control over that. So you're like you output a song that you play and it's limited. I don't know when it's coming out, you don't know. So we don't want people to hear, oh, we're thinking about the music and what we're doing. So we decide to take a little one, one, one. So when we go on tour like with Peter, we'll bring back a little money and put it back in there. And everything will work straight away. And then I think we'll come off this tour with Mick Jackow and Peter and I booked Channel One for one week, 24 hours, and we played probably all of the tune-ups in Baltimore, below on the floor, everything coming, coming to one.
