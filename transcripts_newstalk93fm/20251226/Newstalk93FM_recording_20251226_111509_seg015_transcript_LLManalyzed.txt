20251226 111509 That's what I want, that's what I want There are no hard feelings if you only want to act like lovers too For a night or two And sometimes in the morning go back to being someone you never knew You never knew Baby don't you worry You ain't gonna hurt me tonight It won't be the worst time If this is how it is then she kiss me again And say you don't want this hurt but it's already broke Told me she told us just goes up in smoke Only stay a couple nights then she gon' be gone I said baby you should know that's what I want She said you don't want this hurt boy, it can't be fixed
