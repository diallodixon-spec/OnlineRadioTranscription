I don't mind phones It's my phone time to sleep with the speaker right back at it That is boom boom boom just beating the nail The shoes gone lace up ready to go I'm in Sarebole, up on your steady Can't blame me, I'm a little bit steady Can't blame me if a dream is for what we don't have for next Make your way, get up Shake the whole piece up, chop up those people who don't know Let them all out here, yeah
