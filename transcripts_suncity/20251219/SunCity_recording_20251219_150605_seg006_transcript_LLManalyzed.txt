20251219 150605 Lisa, it is so good to see you. But sorry you catch me like this, girl. My uncle said when my family go for clarity, you don't want to hear the price of the people they put on or something. But the matter is worse, I hear half of the things they're missing, and I don't see a customs. Girl, how you don't see customs? Lisa, stop going like you don't have any sense, man. You don't see everybody talk about it in the media? You don't want to stop listening hearsay, have you ever experienced that? Customs don't go into your package, suitcase, barrel or cargo unless you ship the item or the agent stand up right there when they inspect it. Listen, customs job is to protect the borders, collect revenue and to facilitate trade. They don't collect or store shipment, they inspect it. And somebody else represents it for inspection. So how do customers ever get so much cost in them? Tracy, and the customs alone is involved in the clearance process, even though it's them we tend to talk about. Look at it this way.
