20251222 165636 Hey, courtesy of the captain, Freddie McGregor, bringing down the curtains inside the Innocent of Ives for yet another Monday afternoon. Hope you enjoy yourself musically. It has been a musical journey up until now. In the meantime, you're still going to be back tomorrow for another musical journey straight through up until 5 o'clock. Keep it locked to 96 as always. And while traveling through this journey, remember to love somebody today. Love will always be the answer. It cannot be bought, neither can be sold. It must be earned. So make sure that you are loving someone from the heart. But in order to love that brother and sister, you got to love yourself.
