I've seen many try to break us They don't wanna see us together, no People will die because of them all Yo, are you my love? Now what that got you? Me no clever Tell her me now go leave when she's a great man Whatever, she said me drop her kit I'm so much girl walking the pleasure But so much mean nothing if me not begin with simple All you mean to me I miss you When you say that me I'll just keep a beat Cause see when you see Love you but you never see Couple I'm afraid to see you Your love ain't nothing good cause I know I'm in a league Six in this I feel you too In a head I see you in Look how you make me wanna start shooting you
