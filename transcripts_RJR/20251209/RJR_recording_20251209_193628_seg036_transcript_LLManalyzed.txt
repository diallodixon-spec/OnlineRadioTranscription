But when it comes to Jamaica this Christmas, you know, it's out West Whatever he was going to bring him going to have to bring it double for the people in the West You know and you're right. You're right, you know Santa might have to go make couple trip well for Jamaica because we definitely need it. By the way, you know who named Santa? Who? You and me. It's we as Jamaicans who have to go make sure we look out for our own people first., alright? Yes, some people might literally not see Christmas this year if we don't bring it to them. So I'm encouraging everyone who can, from big corporate companies down to individual citizens, please help bring a little Christmas joy to the people still affected by Hurricane Melissa? You know, we could talk about another part of things. So the other day we heard entertainment personalities saying that they are disappointed that a lot of the usual celebratory Christmas events and activities are being cancelled based on what happened after Melissa. And boy, you know, I feel like a two-sided cutlass right now, you know, because we can't really see both sides of that.
