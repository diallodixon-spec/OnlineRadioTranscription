My uncle sent one by line when my family got for credit. You don't want to hear the price of the people they put on it or something. Make matters worse, I hear half of the things they're missing and I know it's their customs. Girl, all you know is their customs. Lisa, stop going like you don't have any sense, man. You don't see everybody I talk about it in the media? You don't want me to stop listening to you, say? You ever experience that? Customs don't go into your package, suitcase, barrel or cargo unless you ship the item or the agent stand up right there when they inspect it. Listen, Customs job is to protect the borders, collect revenue and to facilitate. They don't collect store shipments, they inspect it and somebody has to present it for inspection.
