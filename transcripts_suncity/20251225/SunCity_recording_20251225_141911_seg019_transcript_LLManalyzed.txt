20251225 141911 And I promise you that we will always be together Till the end of time So today I finally find The courage deep inside Just to walk right up to your door But my body can't move When I finally get to it Just like a thousand times before Then without a word He handed me this letter When I hope this finds the way to your heart He said I love you
