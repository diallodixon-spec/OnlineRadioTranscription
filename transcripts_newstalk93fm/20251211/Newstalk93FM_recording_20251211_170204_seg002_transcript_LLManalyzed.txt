Mm, yeah, candy ball friend, friend, friend. Oh, yeah. Lord, me candy ball friend. Friend, friend, friend, yeah. Lord me candy ball friend, until we meet up again. Mm, everything gone sat, you know. Mm, the bag gone packed, you know. She dreamin' to take a wife on me, cause she comin' down to please. When she ram a chair, With your hands them up in the sky Watch we drunk and having a time
