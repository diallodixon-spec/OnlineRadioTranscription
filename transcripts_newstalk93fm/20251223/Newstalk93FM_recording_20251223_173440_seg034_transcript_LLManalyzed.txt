20251223 173440 So pray for me If I don't come home in the morning Just know that I say it's not in my place But this mass have a hold on me I can't leave Until every single bottle down If anyone look is for me then You can find me where Bumble says she I am meeting people fighting So complain if they want to know Tell them you can find me out on the road I'm ready to walk to chest up for the time to free up Oh I'm not going home tonight. I'm not coming home tonight.
