20260101 090405 And then again I've been down real low Where there was no one in my life that needed me Hard I found that material things I thought had so much value Oh girl, didn't really have any value at all That I was a lonely man A man with no direction, with no purpose With no one to love, and no one to love me for, for me Oh girl, then you, then you came into my life You made my jag jagged edges smooth, you made my directions so clear, and you, oh woman, you became my purpose, my reason for living, girl. You see, you're my heart, you're my soul, you're my stone.
