20251222 092814 Hello, Jamaica. I am Queen Jojo and I'm filling in for Sun Diamond. She's off, right? So I'm feeling in for a while. And a while is like less than two weeks. So fret not yourself. You'll hear Sun Diamond's lovely voice very soon. All right, guys. Carl says, good morning, Jojo. Is it too early for you? No, Carl. I'm at work from morning till night, every single. It's never too early or too late for me. And big ups to Chill Spot in Toronto, who said, yes, man, he agreed with the whole statement and conversation in cancer and me. And big up to Jojo in Canada. And I'm upset for letting me know that they weren't hearing the lady clearly, so we could bring that up. Merry Christmas to you too and Jennifer says good morning Queen Jojo bless up Sundyman for me and tell her stay safe we miss her so hear that Sundyman they miss you and she also says the Queen Jojo can you please bless my daughter Sian am I
