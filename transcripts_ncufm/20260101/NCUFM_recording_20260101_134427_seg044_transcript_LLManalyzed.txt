20260101 134427 new year we want to begin it with God as we should begin every day with God and make a full commitment to serving Jesus Christ not just for this year this is not just a new year's resolution but a new life resolution that we will continue to serve him despite the challenges of life after all there's no better way life is hopeless without Christ So many people have committed suicide and are distressed and helpless, don't know where to turn. Only in God, only in Christ is there real hope. So I suggest, I counsel you, dear listeners, make Jesus Christ your best friend. Make him your eternal friend and Savior. Thank you Heavenly Father for this new day, for the beginning of a new year. Lord, we commit ourselves again into your hands and as we continue our daily study of your Word, draw us closer to you. Give us a new experience
