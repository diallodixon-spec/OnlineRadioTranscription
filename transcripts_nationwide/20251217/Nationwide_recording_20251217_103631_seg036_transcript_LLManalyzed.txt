20251217 103631 Has your licensed firearm been lost or stolen? Time is of the essence. Report the incident immediately to both the nearest police station and the firearm licensing authority. Quick action can prevent your firearm from being used in illegal activities and it also helps you to avoid penalties that could arise from the delay in reporting. Keeping the authorities informed is not only a legal obligation but a critical safety measure. The preceding Christmas safety tip was brought to you. Our next caller, Claude. Good morning.
