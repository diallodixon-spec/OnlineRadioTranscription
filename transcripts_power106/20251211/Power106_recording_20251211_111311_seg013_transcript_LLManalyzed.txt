on top of the 170 that are here now. Without that money, the 170 linesmen would have been decommissioned this week, meaning that they would be decommissioned and have to leave because there would be no funding to pay them. So the $150 million goes towards keeping those 170 linesmen in Jamaica and adding another 300 linesmen. That comes with the equipment, the trucks, and all that you see currently on the road now that that 170 linesmen are doing. All right, so my understanding there is that the reason JPS is able to say that their 90% are meeting their target in December is that those lines men, the 170 and the additional 300 are already operating. Yes? No, that is all 300. They are not here yet.
