============================================================

for this year's pantomime and pantomime is something that I have been you know going to for a long time I can remember as a child going to see the pantomime all the different stories each year and just having that as a cultural experience in my life, I greatly appreciate it. Big up my parents for instilling the tradition. And even now, as an adult, I still try my best to go and see the pantomime and all the other productions, theater productions that happens in Jamaica. Now, I want to talk about it because yesterday at the media launch, they did show us a few snippets from this year's production, which is Big Yard Vibes. And Kevin, you can put up the photo side by side while I speak.
