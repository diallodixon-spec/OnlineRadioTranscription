20251225 121710 I will play once more for Jenny's. This is on my mind, this is on my mind Trying to put a muzzle on my crazy feelings For one minute I'm crawling, then the next I'm trippin' When somebody knew, I swear she don't deserve it We're still on my mind, she's still on my mind And we build it up, build it up Just to let it all shuffle away
