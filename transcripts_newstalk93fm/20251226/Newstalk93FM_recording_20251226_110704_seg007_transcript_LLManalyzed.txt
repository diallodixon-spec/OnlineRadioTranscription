20251226 110704 Baby, that's how it is when you Nobody make me stop the world So you're my third fashion Give me what you ask for So tell me if you want action Until the lights back on I got the one we could last long I don't even know my time Feel like what I waited for out and chill up in my villa, take it out the whole night. Just get in the drop top, take the head out and cruise with your head outside. Go ahead, it's your time, baby. It's your time baby. Get get wild baby. That's the difference when you're my baby. That's how it is when you. Somebody make me stop the whirling.
