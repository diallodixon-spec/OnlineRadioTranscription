20260102 132519 It was a big crowd. I suspect it was about over 8,000 people. The crowd was massive. It was a good vibe, good crowd. Scaled down version of what it used to be. But I suspect that because they added St. Elizabeth and they were doing it in five other locations and added Black River. I think that was the epicenter for the fireworks. The Prime Minister was in Black River. So it was scaled down, and understandably so, because we're facing Melissa and Pink. Everybody's watching budget. But I think a good energy was had anyway, and people had a good time. It was just good to see family members out. People just, I think, just want to make sure that they're ringing the New Year with family and friends, and it was a great place to gather. So what? 2026, what are you looking forward to sir? More money. Say more money? More money man, if you make some money this year. It's a good way to start the year.
