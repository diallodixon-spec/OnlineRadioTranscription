For all to find peace And then they found a little look In a stable all forlorn And in a manger, golden dark Mary's little boy was born Up now hear the angels sing, a king was born today. And man will live forevermore because of Christmas Day. The fairest boy child, Jesus Christ, was born on Christmas Day. The world was aglow, all the bells rang out, there were tears of joy and laughter. People shouted, let everyone know there is hope for all.
