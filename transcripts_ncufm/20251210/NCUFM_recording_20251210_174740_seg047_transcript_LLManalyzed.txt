Yeah, yeah Ooh, the moment he sang It's the true grace he gave me Today's the cover deep in my heart There's great joy in knowing With him I am growing I never want from him to depart Oh, he gets sweeter as the days go by. He gets sweeter as the lonely cry. His love is richer, deeper, sweeter, sweeter, sweeter as the days go by His love is sweeter
