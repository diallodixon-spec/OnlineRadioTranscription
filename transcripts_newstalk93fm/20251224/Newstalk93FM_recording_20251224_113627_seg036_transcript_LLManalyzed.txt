20251224 113627 Traffic jam, traffic jam, traffic jam. We causing a scene, darling. Traffic jam, traffic Jam, traffic jam, we causing a scene, darlin'. I don't care, I don't care. 3D without no no matter. We are the island. I don't care I'll tell you what's up. Don't care, don't care, I don't care I tell you I'm good I don't have a word, boy I don't care Tell you I'm good Don't got a word, boy So pray for me If I don't come home in the morning Just know that I say it's not in my place But this mass have a hold on me I can't leave Until every single bottle done If anyone look it for me then You can find me wherever I the road, I'm ready to walk, just the full time to feel.
