Even though sometimes the hills are hard to climb Let your light shine Woah, let me see you light it up Woah, we are diamonds in the rough Woah, voices so loud, can't be denied Across the world, our lives still shine Because we people, one country. Spreading love everywhere we go. Yeah, so much friends that pass
