20251226 171410 Home again When I try to do something My heart cannot pretend Oh, those feelings Not those feelings Not again You should follow me I know I should be there where you are I'm tossin' and turnin' in my sleep To be without you, without you I'm gonna have to let you fade out, you know I've got to get to where you are. No matter how near or far, I've gotta get to where you a-a-are. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
