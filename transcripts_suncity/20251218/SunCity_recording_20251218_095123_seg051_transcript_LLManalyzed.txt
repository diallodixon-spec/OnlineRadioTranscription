20251218 095123 Okay Okay, so Mikey can you touch on that for us? Absolutely, and and I'm actually gonna bring dr. Ampsey back in in a second because what I want to talk about, you know rather than the food right because It's important to realize that you know, we talk and if you have listeners that listen to the show every week They know yes the types of foods we tell them are bad and the types of food We tell them that a good, the way they should eat, you know, less fried food, less deep fried food, less sugar, less salt. It's standard. I'll repeat myself forever because to get the message through. But what I want to talk about is more fundamental, right? One of the reasons why people are struggling to heal themselves, remember the body can heal itself given the right tools, is that with all this stuff I keep talking about the food it's because the nutrients the energy the particles whatever we need to heal us it's supposed to be in the food but it's not in the food why because the soil has been damaged
