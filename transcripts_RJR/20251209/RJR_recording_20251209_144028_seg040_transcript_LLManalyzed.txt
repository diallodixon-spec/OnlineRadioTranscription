what do you call it? Entrepreneurs were like, but Eileen, this don't taste bad. You can sell it. And it took me a little while to experiment and learn it a little bit more. So it took me a couple of months before I decided I would bring it to market and that I started by selling to the vendors there, selling to persons who came by. And then as I built up my confidence in brewing this and also the taste became a little better because you know when you first make something it's not 100% the best is not perfect so as time went on and I was a lot more confident in the product that's when we actually took it to market the following year maybe by June the following year. Very interesting it was last week we were talking to a representative from the Chinese community here in Jamaica, talking to them about the things that the Chinese have brought to us here. And here, another one we're discussing now is kombucha. Very interesting. What were the challenges that you faced?
