Perfect imperfections. Give your all to me. I give my all to you. You're my end and my beginning. Even when I lose the game. Cause I give you all of me. Yeah. And you give you Even when you're crying, you're beautiful too My world is beating you down I'm around to every move You're my downfall, you're my muse My worst distraction, my rhythm and blues I can't stop singing, it's ringing in my ear for you My head's underwater, but I'm breathing fast
