20251231 212823 And then, what is it you asked me? My album, Welcome to Paradise comes out October 10th, so that's 10-10-2025. And then, just find me on YouTube and I go and check out all the visualizers for the songs. Please stream the songs and share it, you know what I mean? And support the music that is reaching the world. Please and thank you. Yeah, I don't want to just be popular in other places. Yeah man, you're popular at yard too man. I appreciate the music at the yard. In Portugal, two years ago in Portugal, I was in Zara and a girl just came up to me and was like, Oh my God. I was like, Whoa. Yes. So, um, I don't need fame at home, but what I want is love and support as always. Please. And thank you guys. And she's talented with some great songs. All right. So what we're going to do is we're going to throw it to the break. And then when we come back from the break, we'll be hearing a performance from the lovely Naomi Cowan. Remember, 10 10 20 25. Yes.
