20251225 145630 This is serious. When should you operate? I have a space open tomorrow morning. Tomorrow? Oh, that's not enough time for me to get in shape. Get in shape, Mr. Smith? Yeah. I don't want to have an operation without being in good health. I need to quit smoking. I don't think you have the time. And drinking. I need to stop drinking. Mr. Smith, you need major surgery. Yeah, I know, but I want to be in good health first. And a haircut. I need to get a haircut. Why would anyone wait until they were in good health before they had life-saving surgery? Many people have this same attitude about going to God. They feel they need to clean up their life first. The problem is, we all have a life-threatening disease called sin, and the only cure is Jesus. Are you trying to be good when you need to turn to Jesus? Another message from Lifeline Productions is your opportunity to usher in the Sabbath hours with us. So join me, Lyseth Martin.
