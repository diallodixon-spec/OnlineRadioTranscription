20260101 101811 I really miss the way you squeeze and moan and call out my name. Oh, you caught me, baby. I remember you like to take your time to get in the mood. Oh, yes, you do, yeah. But once you're in the mood, you like to go straight to the move. Oh, yes, you do, girl. It's been so long since we've had a night together. I miss you when I get through love and you, girl. Fire and desire will burn in you forevermore.
