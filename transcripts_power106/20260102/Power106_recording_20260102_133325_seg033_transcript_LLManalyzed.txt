20260102 133325 Let me read a couple of messages. Simon, your Prime Minister said you have IDs for you to get hurricane benefits. The Prime Minister himself is not qualified. How could he be allowed to be in charge of so much money when he has not made his statutory declaration? Some people lost their IDs because of the hurricane, yet you're telling them they can't get any of the relief. Wholeness is not qualified. No one should send any money to Wholeness government. That's from Salah. Salah, to be fair, he did say you would need your ID in order to collect certain benefits. And that is the same no matter where you are in the world today. So you're being a little disingenuous there. As it relates to his statutory declarations, he has made them, they just haven't been accepted by the integrity commission. All right, where is he going now? Kevin, good afternoon.
