20251230 195138 Pretend that this will end another way Tomorrow you'll wake up and be on your way Forget all the things you'll say tonight That's why I'm caught up In one night love affair And true love will find me there You see I'm caught up in one night, love affair In true love, we'll find you there You see I'm harder In one night love affair In the heat of love again That's just the way I am So make yourself at home I want to warm you for a while Oh yeah I haven't got much time to find the man behind the smile I'm a fairy tale princess in search of a night And I never believe dreams come true
