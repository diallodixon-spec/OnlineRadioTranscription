20251231 112922 So don't be late, the truck heaven can't wait. We are team to celebrate, I'm telling you. Hard work without the smart work, it's not work. We don't want no batter that I need a little breather. Two days on the road with some jam in the middle. Diving home, we need to find the middle. For the sake of peace of mind. So the middle of the road is where you'll find me and my friend and them because we move so hard, so hard. For a week, we deserve a party. We deserve it, say we deserve it, yeah we deserve it Set all your friends on them, set all the girls on them, bring all your friends and them, and let's get it started I say, I say, what do you, what do you want, so come and say thank you
