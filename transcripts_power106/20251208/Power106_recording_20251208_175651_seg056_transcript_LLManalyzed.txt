My body keeps calling for your touch Your kisses and your sweet romance Singles on the other side of you Where this a woman adore Aside from your temper everything else secure I know you're good for is me And somehow I'm full of forgiveness I guess it's meant to be And you're really lovely underneath it all And you want to love me Underneath it all I really love you Underneath it all You really love me
