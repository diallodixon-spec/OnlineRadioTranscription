20260101 141911 at 33, five is global pursuit at six to one, enthusiasm is at 19 to one, and the favorite is Rico Rico Rico. Small field of seven, fairly competitive race, only because none of these are stalwarts. They disappoint from time to time. They run a good race today, bad race tomorrow. So in terms of confidence, I would say I'm probably only 40% confident of what I'm about to say. I'm going to go with number six, enthusiasm, and number seven, Rico Rico Rico, only because they were beaten by Don Quesi in different races, and Don Quesi is a very good horse. So I think one of them will step up today. So either enthusiasm at 17 to one, or Rico Rico Rico at three to five. We have almost a line, as we have only enthusiasm left to go in. Let's take it over now for the call of race number 4.
