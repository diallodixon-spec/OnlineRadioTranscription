20251216 130402 workers were asking you to just hang on a little bit we are going to pay your December 1 money but give us a break we just had Melissa and then they turned around to the small businesses and the people of Jamaica and they said we're not giving you no break give us 7% now stick it up and I don't think you can just ask somebody to give you a break and then turn around with a gun and stick up somebody for seven percent on top of that you're getting 150 million US dollars from my pocket and Forbes pocket. I think something just went wrong there. When it's your time, you seek mercy.
