20251223 162014 If I can see you when I want, I'll see you when I can. If loving you is wrong, I don't want to be right. I might wrong to fall so deeply in love with you. Knowing I got a wife and two little children, depending on me too. And am I wrong to hunger for the gentleness of your touch? Knowing I got someone else at home who needs me just as much. And are you wrong to give your love to a married man? And I'm not wrong for trying to hold on to the best thing I ever had. If loving you is wrong, I don't want to be right.
