Can we do it? We can let it all come out Well it's not safe to go walk about A slacker house, a mug that's a water house She start a rouse, sometimes she want a spouse She start to out, start beat a darker stout Guns come out, rockin' people funds run out Keep a show last week and no one come out Moms come out, me guest and just run out I and I claim the victory through humility, discipline and perseverance. What the mind can conceive and believe it can achieve.
