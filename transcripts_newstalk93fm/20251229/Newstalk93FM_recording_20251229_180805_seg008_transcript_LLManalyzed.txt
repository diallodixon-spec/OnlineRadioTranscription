We fly That style where you give me the damn head Roll your bumper, just push it further Bubble up, sit down and drive like a learner You do the thing so me never get hurt One time, gel bubble down there Two time, gel bubble right there For the last time, girl, we are doing it over and over We call that a slow one Just skip it, just skip it, just sk- Right now it is my time Let it my time, girl Don't tell me to join in All I want is waistline Right now it is waistline Waistline of love
