20251216 162718 It doesn't mean it's not doing any good to us. So I'm saying to the Maroons, please go back to the drawing board. And the more help you can get, the better it is for you all. Make no sense to divide, because that's not going to work. It's one land we have in Jamaica here. Right? And remember, the government is in charge. You cannot fight the government. You can always, you know, disagree with things and stuff and that is how it's going to be forever. So let us do the right thing. Go back to the drawing board and say to the Colonel, I know what and what I did. Because the soldier is our children same way. The soldier no different from we are same people. You know what I mean? Yeah, I get you. I get you. So we have to welcome everybody man because so long as there's no fighting we're good. And the next thing I want to touch on is the rumble era.
