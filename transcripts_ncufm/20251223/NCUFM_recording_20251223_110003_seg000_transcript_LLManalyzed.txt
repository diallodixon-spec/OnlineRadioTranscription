The time by NCU is... It's 11 o'clock. There are days when I don't pray And from God's words I stray I forget about God And I make him sad But he loves me in spite of me Yes, he loves me In spite of me. I have cheated at life and feel guilty inside. I have gone my own way, yet he still call me today. Cause he love me in spite me. Yes, he love me.
