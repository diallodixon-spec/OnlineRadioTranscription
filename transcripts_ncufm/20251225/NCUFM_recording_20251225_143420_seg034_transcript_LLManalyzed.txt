So today, as you enjoy, as you enjoy the holiday, consider how you can reflect God's love in your words and in your actions, making every interaction a gift of grace. Heavenly Father, I want to thank you for the priceless gift of your love through Christ Jesus. Help us to reflect that love in our daily interactions today and always. Teach us to be patient, teach us to be kind and compassionate to those around us. And may our words and actions bring encouragement, may they bring peace, and may they bring joy, showing others the depth of your love. Bless our families, bless our friends and bless our communities and fill our hearts with gratitude and love as we live out your purpose. In your name we pray, Amen.
