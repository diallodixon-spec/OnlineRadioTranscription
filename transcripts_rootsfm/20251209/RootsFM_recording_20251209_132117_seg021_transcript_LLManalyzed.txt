Can you hear me when I say Put your lighters in the air If you knowan. Family, me deal with me bun, yes, man. In a interview, them ask nuff question. Them wanna know where me born and where me come from. Tell them, they'll a beg a same time. They saw me born right by the chain line. Ten and a half psychotics at the same time. And if a brother nuh have, me say me, we share mine with them. Share it like a good news, cause me and me family like a cook food Late in the hours a night we cook food Every plate haffi full up a rice and good stew Let me see some lighter From you nose say you feel alright And me say you up the feet all evening That's how me haffi clean up people
