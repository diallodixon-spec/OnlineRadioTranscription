That's a whole heap of debris. And even if you can come and help with your two hands, I think people definitely appreciate that. You know, even as we talk about that, we definitely have to warn people to take the necessary steps to protect themselves from Leptospirosis, alright? The Health Ministry just announced that we are in the middle of an outbreak of that illness, so people need to be careful, especially when they're cleaning up. That's right, because for those of you who don't know, Leptospirosis is contracted when people get in contact with the urine of an infected animal, mainly rodents, also known as rats. Floodwaters is one of the common contaminants and we see how many places are still dealing with flooding since the hurricane. So people, even before the National Cleanup Campaign, make sure you wear medication and things for treatment on the island to help anyone who contracts it and if treated early.
