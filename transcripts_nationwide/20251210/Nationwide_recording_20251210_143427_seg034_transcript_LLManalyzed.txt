To desperation Our own vacation And I got this one boy And he won't stop calling When I walk this way I know I got him Too bad your ex don't do it for ya Walked in, the dream came true to play ya Saw a skin and I perfumed it for ya Yes, I know I'm nothing to it for you Yes, I'm only coffee brewed for you Won't touch and I'm brand new to you And now you think about me every night, oh Isn't that sweet, I can't go Say you can't sleep, baby, I know That's not me, it's my soul Know that I'm down, I'm dry, oh Touch it like Nintendo Say you can't sleep, baby, I know that's the meanest way so Move it up, down, up, right on Touch it like Nintendo So you can sleep, baby I know that's all I'm here, what's hot when you're at it? You knock the shots and come back
