Good evening, sir. Well, thank you for having me. Okay. All right. Sale coming up on Sunday, we'll be talking a lot about that and also other things happening in the industry, understand that there's a change of board at the Jamaica Racing Commission and so on. So things are happening. We will be getting into that and the implications of the things that are happening at the minute, because I don't know that the thoroughbred racing industry is at all that would have paid. But for those who may not know it, Mr. Desmond Lewis is a breeder of good resources. Desmond, when did you get into this business of liking horse racing? Because there has to be a law for the sport first before you venture into other areas only.
