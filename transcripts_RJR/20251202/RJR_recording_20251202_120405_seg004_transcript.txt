Alliance, Antoinette Hamilton. Four firearms were recently found in containers coming in as Hurricane Melissa aid from private consignments. One person was taken into custody in connection with the seizures. Investigations are ongoing. The issue was discussed at last Thursday's meeting of the National Security Council, NSC. The Jamaica Customs Agency advised the NSC that there has been a significant increase in goods and materials entering the country, primarily due to the relief effort. As a result, appropriate measures have been implemented to ensure the relief items are handled efficiently and securely, which led to the detection and seizure of the firearms. Prime Minister Dr. Andrew Holness is cautioning persons sending relief items to Jamaica not to include illegal goods and weapons in relief packages. He says the government will continue to ensure the security and integrity of imported items.
