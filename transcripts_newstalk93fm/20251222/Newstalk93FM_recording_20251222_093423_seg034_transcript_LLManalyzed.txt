20251222 093423 I don't listen to nothing they say Every fat a drug, jumping up Doing what I want, jumping up Tell them I ain't living, right they are sleeping Every fat a drug Jumping up, doing what I want Jumping up, tell them I ain't leaving Right they are sleeping Sometimes they tell you I pull myself But I can't keep the tension Too much affect and movement They say I'm too out of control But there's too much action Somebody pour a nexon Until my head gone And I'm miserable All down on the ground I'm causing trouble Look how the security watch me They don't know about me I just mash up in place And I defect like a chumby I don't wait They don't want me cause I do one way, they don't want me in their proscenium.
