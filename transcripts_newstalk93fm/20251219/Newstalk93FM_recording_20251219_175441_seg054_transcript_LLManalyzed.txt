I'll be good on my own. I'll be on my own. Why are you so quick to leave? When we both can make it work. When I'm gone, I'll make you nervous. If you hurt me, I'll it. I've been acting foolishly, forgetting what you are. You start loving me, I know this. But even chaos serves a purpose. It feels good to love somebody and somebody loves you.
