This encompasses physical losses such as leaks, pipe bursts, and water theft. Over the years, NWC has partnered with the Israeli firm Maya to reduce its non-revenue water. This was initially done in the Kingston and St. Andrew area. In this area, there seems to be a great deal of success with non- revenue water water average for the KSA just over 45 percent. For comparison, the country average as of 2024 is 74 percent. The average rate has hovered relatively unchanged, over 70 percent since 2019.
