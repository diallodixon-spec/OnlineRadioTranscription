20251222 152211 Walk behind while you run I look up at your house And I can almost hear you shout out down to me Where I always used to be And I miss you Like the pheasants miss the rain. And I miss you. Like the pheasant miss the rain. This is Rewind Monday. 104.9 FM, Sunset Radio, Radio Winnipeg. I like to move it, move it. You like to move it.
