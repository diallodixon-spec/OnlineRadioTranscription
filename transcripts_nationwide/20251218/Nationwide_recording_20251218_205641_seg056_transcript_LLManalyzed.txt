The award ceremony at the National Police College of Jamaica in St. Catherine earlier today lauded the officers for their courage and dedication towards building a safer, inclusive, and more resilient country driven by transformation. Transformation calls upon every citizen, every leader, and every partner to play a role in shaping a police service that is grounded in trust, in transparency, and in excellence. With renewed purpose, let us press forward towards a Jamaica where peace is a lived reality and where every citizen feels protected and is respected.
