20251230 154318 I'm just trying to get you high. You don't need a lonely night. So baby, I can make it just gotta let me try Give you what you want You've been scared of love And what it did to you You don't have to run I know what you can do Just a simple touch And it can set you free We don't have to rush when you're alone with me I feel it coming, I feel it coming babe
