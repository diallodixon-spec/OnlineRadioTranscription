20251216 114742 The bill was paid by cheque. The NWC say we don't want no cheque. We want cash or your credit card. You put a cheque in on the 7th for the bill on the 8th and they say just drop it in a box. Don't walk up and come up here with a cheque. Drop it in a box. I'd like to know what type of cheque they're talking here because that don't make any sense to me. And come back for the receipt another day. Why? Because we just drop it in the box. And then NWC charge you a late payment fee. Yep. That's a little bit on the cray cray side. Dr. Gayle is that fair? No, it's not fair. No, it's definitely not fair. Alright folk.
