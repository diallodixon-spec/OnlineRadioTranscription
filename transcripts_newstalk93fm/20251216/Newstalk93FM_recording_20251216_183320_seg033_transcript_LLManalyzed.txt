20251216 183320 Don't raise your voice Please don't speak my name Just say goodbye It's too late to lie You hit me one-on-one We share this space, let's make it our sacred place Another heart to heart, and we're face to face We both have flaws, so we both need grace And I would never want a world without your warm embrace So no matter what we're throwing through I keep a sacred place in my heart there's a space in my heart for you
