20251230 215333 I've been around and I had a lot of love And I know you had a lot of loves too But I ain't never had nobody That knew the things you do We go together well like the the trees. I'd be in a world of trouble, girl, if you wasn't here with me. Stay forever mine. Oh, cause, cause you're my kind. Ooh,, baby girl you know that I like what you like, you like what I like We belong together
