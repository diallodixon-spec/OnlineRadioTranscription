20251230 182811 return for another edition of The Drive tomorrow. Yeah man, we'll come back from vacation now. So catch you again tomorrow. Overnight, what I'll be doing, I'll be reserving your seat, reserving your seat overnight. So that means if nobody else can sit in your seat, nobody else can take away your seat, this is a bus, it's a big bus, we have a lot of seats, but I want to have one specially for you. But that has implications. If you miss the show tomorrow, then your seat is going to be empty. Your absence is going to be felt. We're talking about a family right now, the drive time family. Don't let the drive time family miss it tomorrow, all right? So catch you tomorrow at two, M-I-C-A-L, over and out. Abigail! Great working with you again, girl. Abigail Williams. Thank you to the new Sports and Current Affairs departments and to the rest of the team here at the NCU Media Group. Until we meet again. M-I-C-A-L Michael Forsyth signing out for now, saying keep safe!
