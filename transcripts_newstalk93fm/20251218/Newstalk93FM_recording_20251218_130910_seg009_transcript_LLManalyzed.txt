20251218 130910 Welcome to Job Town, baby. Look at people in the street Chippin' down a lane It's how we break with the chain Come and taste our freedom, sweetie When you want your ways Look how you have in the places Hot and groovy Look what music could do me It's happy in a jam again Feel like a movie, when you throw it back on me I feel no stress again, let me dance tonight I won't let it charm me Feel the rhythm, it's in the ground
