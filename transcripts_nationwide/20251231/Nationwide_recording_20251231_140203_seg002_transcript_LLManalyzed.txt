20251231 140203 I don't know how to talk to you. I don't know How to ask you if you're okay My friends always feel the need to tell me things Seems like they're just happier than us these days These days I don't know to talk to you I don't know who to be when you need me It feels like the only time you see me Is when you turn your head to the side and look at me differently And last night I think I lost my patience Last night I got highest expectations Last night I came to a realization And I hope you can take it I hope you take it All I'm too good to you I'm way too good to you You take my love for granted I just don't understand it All I'm to good to you
