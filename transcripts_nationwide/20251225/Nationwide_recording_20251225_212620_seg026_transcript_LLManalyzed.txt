20251225 212620 I'm feeling good from my head to my shoes Know where I'm going and I know what to do I'm tired of loving much more than you I've got a new attitude I'm in control, my worries are few How can I live without you? How can I do without you? You talk about the money, so all about the money. She was born for money, so you better be alright. You better live in the corner of your senses for one day there she is.
