So individuals who will have like chronic diseases, because they don't get their medications on time, they're going to go. Infectious related diseases are going to increase. So then you're going to have accidents. Then you have issues related to, in also in our violence, interpersonal violence because of the stress and all of those sorts of stuff. So it is likely, not to be somber, but it is likely, and this is replicated elsewhere in other regions, that after devastation like this, the impact, direct impact, is going to be smaller than what happens subsequently. But the truth be told, despite the fact that we have this rise in infectious diseases, the number of persons overall who are going to be affected is relatively small. The biggest burden in our opinion is going to be the mental health burden, and that has a longer lasting impact and effect. MAJ President and Professor
