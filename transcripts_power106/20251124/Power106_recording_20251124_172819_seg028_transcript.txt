There was music in there? Of course there's music in cars. I don't remember. All I remember is the racing. Okay. All right, Rory. Okay. You have lost this one. I'm sorry, yes. I'm totally vanquished by your ability. I lay on the floor at the end of this battle. So which car would be a good song? A good topic for a song? One of my favorite car songs isn't actually about a car, it's about trucks. It's the Eastbound Down. It's a theme song from one of the best car movies I've made, Smokey and the Bandit, but it's actually about the truck, because he's singing about the 18-wheeler.
