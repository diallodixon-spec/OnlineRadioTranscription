**TransJam CEO Ivan Anderson Discusses Hurricane Relief Efforts**

In an interview with Dr. Orville Taylor on Radio Jamaica's "Hotline" program, Ivan Anderson, CEO of TransJam, discussed the company's hurricane relief efforts. TransJam has launched a program to deliver construction materials to households affected by the hurricane, with the goal of impacting 2,400 households. So far, the company has delivered 500 bundles of materials and expects to deliver another 100 bundles per day until the program is complete.

Anderson explained that the program is targeted at specific households, but the benefits will extend to other individuals and families who are being assisted by those households. He emphasized that the program is an ongoing process and that TransJam will continue to deliver materials until all 2,400 households have been reached.

When asked about the verification process for households, Anderson explained that the Ministry of Labour provides a list of eligible households, which are then verified by TransJam. He encouraged individuals who may have missed the initial list to contact the Ministry of Labour or their local MP to get added to the list.

Anderson also emphasized the importance of checks and balances in the program, stating that while TransJam wants to ensure that no one is left out, they also need to verify the eligibility of households to prevent abuse of the system.

**Experts Discuss Stress and Medication Management**

In a separate interview, Dr. Elizabeth Crosman and Mrs. Sharon Palmer Dawkins joined Dr. Orville Taylor to discuss stress and medication management, particularly in the context of the holiday season and the ongoing recovery efforts from the hurricane.

Dr. Crosman emphasized the importance of recognizing the signs of stress and taking steps to manage it, such as sticking to routines, getting enough sleep, eating a healthy diet, and engaging in activities that reduce stress. She also encouraged individuals to seek help if they are feeling overwhelmed or struggling to cope.

Mrs. Palmer Dawkins discussed the importance of creating a fixed routine for taking medication, such as setting alarms or using a calendar. She also suggested using tools like pill organizers or apps to help individuals remember to take their medication.

Both experts emphasized the importance of support networks, including family, friends, and community, in helping individuals manage stress and stay on track with their medication. They encouraged individuals to prioritize self-care and seek help if needed, and to take advantage of resources like the National Health Fund's schedule refill program to stay consistent with their medication regimen.
