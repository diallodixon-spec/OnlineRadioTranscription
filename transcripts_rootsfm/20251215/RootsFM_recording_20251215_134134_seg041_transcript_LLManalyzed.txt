20251215 134134 You say you love me and you care But you never been here You always on the run Now tell me this Why we can't spend no quality time Kick back and just unwind You always have something to do That simple me, that love you not true Cause only when you want to me hear you shout I love you Tell me where all the passion gone All of the warmth Tell me where is all of the tenderness And there is something else That's been bugging me for so long Tell me this Tell me if love's so nice Tell me why it hurts so bad So, so, so, so let the door it eats ya I, I wear the good lunch
