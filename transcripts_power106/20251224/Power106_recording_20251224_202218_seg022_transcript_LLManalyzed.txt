20251224 202218 Not alone with a song and a wintery fairyland Our cheeks are nice and rosy and comfy, cosy are we We're snuggled up together like two birds of a feathered wood bee Let's take that whirling ball and sing our chorus or two Come on, it's lovely when the horse lay right together with you There's a birthday party at the Hall of Home, I agree It'll be the the songs we love to sing Without a single stop At the fireways while we watch the chestnuts pop There's a happy feeling, nothing in the world can buy When they pass around a coffee and a ball can buy It'll really be like a picture print, the career in us These wonderful things are the things we can never hold for a while Just give this way down to them
