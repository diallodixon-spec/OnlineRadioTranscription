**Interview with Garnet Reid, President of the Small Business Association of Jamaica**

In a recent interview on Power 106 FM, Garnet Reid, President of the Small Business Association of Jamaica, expressed his strong opposition to the 7% increase in electricity rates imposed by the Jamaica Public Service (JPS). Reid stated that the increase is "unconscionable" at this time, given that small businesses are still recovering from the devastating effects of Hurricane Melissa.

Reid emphasized that the increase will have a significant impact on small businesses, which are already struggling to stay afloat. "Electricity is one of the biggest inputs of operating a small business," he said. "You need it to run your fridge, your generator, your stove, your telephone, and the list goes on and on." He argued that the increase will lead to a further decline in sales, which have already dropped by 30% island-wide.

Reid also questioned the allocation of $150 million in taxpayer money to JPS, as well as the $50 million insurance payout from the Office of Utilities Regulation (OUR). He demanded clarification on how these funds will be used, suggesting that they should be used to support the recovery of small businesses rather than funding increases in electricity rates.

The President of the Small Business Association of Jamaica called on the government to intervene and review the contract of the Jamaica Public Service Company. He recommended bringing in other players to bid on the contract, which would increase competition and potentially lead to better rates for consumers.

Reid also expressed his disappointment with the management of JPS, stating that they have not been a good company for Jamaica. He criticized their decision to delay salary increases for their workers, despite receiving significant funding from taxpayers and insurance payouts.

In conclusion, Reid reiterated his opposition to the 7% increase in electricity rates and called for a rollback. He urged the Minister of Energy, Darrell Voss, to provide clarity on the allocation of the $150 million in taxpayer money and to take action to support small businesses in their recovery efforts. As Reid emphasized, "It's unfortunate, and we will not be having a Merry Christmas."
