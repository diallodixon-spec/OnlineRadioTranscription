I'm just asking you to explain to my listeners why it would be a problem. If the witness is going to be cross-examined by the prosecutor anyway, who is going to put to them that they're not telling the truth, why does it matter if those questions come from the prosecutor or come from the bench? No, no, because that's the point. The judges would then be usurping and taking over what the prosecution should do, should have done. That is the point, you know. The judge is supposed to be a referee and an umpire, as it were. Can I make a parting? Yeah, I was going to ask if you wanted to add to that, Bert, and then Audley. Yeah, I just want to say Miss Jackson, who is at the DPP, now a high court judge, senior to Audley, is a competent prosecutor. She didn't need any help. She's very experienced. She's now a high-court judge. So he didn't need that, and defense counsel is a senior lawyer.
