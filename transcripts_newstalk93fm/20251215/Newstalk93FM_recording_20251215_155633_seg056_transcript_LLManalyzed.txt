20251215 155633 I will never let you go One thing I have to say to you I'm just loving it and let me gravitate to you Give me the compass, let me navigate to you Fly off the sail on my way to you Deep as the blue sea, your love's flowing into me And even though the waves out from this love will just love me Deep as the blue sea, deep as the dark blue, you know? So accurate. I said I need your love. Never them Kansas, you know?
