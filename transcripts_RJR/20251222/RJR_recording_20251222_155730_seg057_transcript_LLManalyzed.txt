Time's and it'll get harder Mother can't find food for your daughter Themse hopes and dreams can't live off her Yeah, yeah And for the youth dem not the struggle where you hold it the same way The mother where you pray for your son to put down the key But the system a do for she And for the father where he work on the lava ground. Some place over some part where not even water run them. So what the system do for we? Only God he knows how we survive. Street life for no peace of mind.
