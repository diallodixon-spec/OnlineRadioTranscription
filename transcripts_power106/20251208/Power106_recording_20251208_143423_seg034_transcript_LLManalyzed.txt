What is on the title stand? So even though Mary has something else in her will, the will cannot override the title. And we see it happening all the time where someone makes a particular gift, a particular provision in their will, and for whatever reason, maybe they forgot or they changed their mind, they go ahead and they make a change to the title. What is on the Title stand? So if you have any changes to your assets, if you change your mind, make sure you upgrade your will. Because it is disheartening to say the least. Sometimes someone comes in, a beneficiary or a supposed beneficiary, they think they're a beneficiary. In the wind, it says the property is left to them but when we do the type of searches there is no longer any property the property was long transferred it was long sold to someone else so any changes any of your asset holdings please update your documents even no longer
