I'm happy when you get a chance to tune in. We know sometimes how the afternoons go. You have the busy schedule, you have the busy day and you still try to find a time to tune in to the drive. Just so you know, your driver appreciates it. Thank you for tuning in. All those who are tuned in at work, yeah man, work they are almost finished. Especially if you finish at five o'clock. If you're doing that 9 to 5, well you have one hour to go. One hour to go. And I know some persons, it's usually at that time that you finally get a chance to tune in to the drive. Either way, welcome on board the drive.
