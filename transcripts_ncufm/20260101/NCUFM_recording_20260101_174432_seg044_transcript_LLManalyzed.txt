20260101 174432 We come here on a daily basis, especially at the start of a year, looking forward to what is to come. We certainly have to give God thanks. Happy New Year, Michael. As a driver, God has shielded me. Oh, happy New Year, Michael, as a driver. So for me on the road, God shielded me from many near misses. So I give him thanks. However, in August of last year, a man ran into the back of my vehicle. The impact was so frightening, but I'm thankful that God spared me from the worst. Thank you, Jesus. I also saw a message from Somiya. I put the message down and said, I'm going to come and read the message. And you know, Somiya, delete the message. Somiya, how you do? Good day. Welcome on board the drive again. Good afternoon, Michael. Happy New Year. May you have a blessed and a wonderful year pressed on the upward way. Staying connected to Jesus Christ all the time. That's the aim.
