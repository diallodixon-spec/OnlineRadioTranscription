20251215 210906 I'm pretty pretty Make sure you swing your hand When they come to you with argument Make sure you run them I'm happy, I live for life, I make money, we're not a problem A bag of chat, I make her say them bad, we don't look at them Pizzle of a bag of girl, I curse them in a Mayan Said they won't have to take me, throw them camera around, me callin' Foot a brush trigger, I hate these, me pay for the Louis V I just barely started, me my ball, them have a stick away But me now, I'm safe, I'm not dancin', you still run out on me Legend for the new school accidents, that's in my Italy Could take off a teacher, fling your shoulders over Germany
