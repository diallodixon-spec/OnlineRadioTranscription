20251215 134020 I'm a survivor, I'm not gonna give up I'm not gonna stop, I'm gonna make it. I won't survive. Keep on surviving. Thought I couldn't breathe without you. I'm inhaling. You thought I couldn't see without your perfect vision. You thought I could last without you. But I'm lasting. You thought that I would die without you. But, I'm living. Thought that I would fail without you. But. I'm on top. Thought it would be over by now. But it won't stop. Thought that I was deaf and strong. But I'm still here. Even in my years my years to come I'm still gonna be here I'm no survivor, I'm not gonna give up I'm not gonna stop, I'm gonna work harder I'm a survivor, I'm gonna make it I will survive, keep on surviving
