Nobody to love me like you do. I ain't lying about it, babe, loving me like you do, I like my man, love me like you do. Baby, baby, what I said that ain't no man, got a sweet woman like me. She's everything in the world, girl One man can claim She's every poor boy's dream She's every rich man's prayer
