And even though the storms will come, no, we won't run. Just love me, deep as a blue sea. Wherever the wind may carry us, your love's flowing into me. And even though the waves out from this love, the waves are deep as the blue sea. Deep as the blue sea, flowing on and on. I said this love is so strong. No, we won't run. We won't run. No, no, no, no. The love in me is deep as blue sea.
