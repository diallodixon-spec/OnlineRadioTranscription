It's now time for the evening sports report here on NCUFM. I'm Dawson Hosang. We kick off with football as Arsenal maintained their perfect Champions League record after Nonu Maliweke struck twice in a convinced win over club Bruges. The England winger opened the scorn with a fierce drive off the crossbar after beating his defender, before heading in a Martin Zubimendi delivery moment into the second half. Gabriel Martinelli sealed a comfortable night soon after with a curling effort to make it 3-0 and put Arsenal on the brink of the knockout stage. Meanwhile, Manchester City pulled off a statement comeback win away at Real Madrid to pile further pressure on manager Xabi Alonso.
