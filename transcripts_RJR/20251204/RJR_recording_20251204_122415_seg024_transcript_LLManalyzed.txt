After a hurricane, keeping babies nourished and protected is more important than ever. Mothers with young babies should continue breastfeeding as breast milk is safe, clean and strengthens your baby's immunity. If you're expressing breast milk and have no electricity, use the milk within four hours. You can also store it in a glue with ice. This keeps breast milk safe for up to one day. Breastfeeding supports your baby's with two-bedroom, two-bathroom Smart Homes, starting at $36.95 million. Safe, sustainable, and perfect for families ready to live smarter.
