The fireplace keeps turning My thoughts keep turning The pages of memory Of time spent with you Old Christmas songs we knew And used to make love to Make it hard to get used to Christmas without you Christmas without you is my first time hearing that one. I love it. I love it too. Now this next one is you make it feel like Christmas. Gwen Stefani featuring Blake Shelter.
