20251231 164030 Who is the one you're clingin' to Instead of me tonight? And where are you now? Now that I need you Tears on my pillow Wherever you go I'll cry be a river That leads to your ocean You'll never see me fall apart Words of a broken heart is just emotions taking me over Caught up in sorrow, lost in the song But if you don't come back, come home to me, darlin' Don't you know there's nobody left in this world all the time? Don't you know that nobody's left in this world It's the night, the night
