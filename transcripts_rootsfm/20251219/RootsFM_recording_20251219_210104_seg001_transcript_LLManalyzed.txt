20251219 210104 I sometimes see you pass outside my door. Hello. Is it me you're looking for? I can see it in your eyes. I can see in your smile. You're all I've ever wanted. And my arms are open wide. Because you know just what to say. And you know just want to do. And I want to tell you so much I love you
