20251217 142112 You love me too It's more than words can say True love will never decay, oh yeah You feel my way with joy and splendor It's so blind to see Full moon so the light shines brighter So nobody can see Moonlight bright I'm gonna make love to you all night So hold me tight Moonlight bright A boy or a girl I'll give to you, alright The vibe is right I've been Anticipating this moment for so long, for so long, so long. I have been needing the pain for this moment, for so long. For so long, just so long.
