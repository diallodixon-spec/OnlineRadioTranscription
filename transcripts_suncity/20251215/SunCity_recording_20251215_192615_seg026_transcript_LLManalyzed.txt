20251215 192615 I want to say thank you to everybody right now listening to Sun City, allowing the Lord to make his way through your house, your car, your life. It's a time dedicated to the Lord right now. This is how we do it at the end of every show. We've got to give thanks to the Almighty. Where we belong Where the eagles fly On a mountain high Lord lift us up high
