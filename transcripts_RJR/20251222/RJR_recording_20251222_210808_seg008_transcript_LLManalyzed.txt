20251222 210808 Got a highway to the sky We can turn away from the night and day From the tears we've had to bear You're my love I can see you're new to us Everything we are will never die Love is such a beautiful thing You want to see Nobody gets too much heaven, nobody gets too much water to come by, I'm waiting in line. Nobody gets too much love anymore, it's a lie.
