20251223 110103 Love is rocking, playing in the sand I've got my capitone, getting on a jam Xotic setting for a lady and a man A perfect little highway, sounds like a plan We've been saying that all afternoon We can make out some cool baby tunes We can turn another light on Wish we could freeze this know that, that's right. Call me, I'll be fine, I'm gonna call you son. Christmas in Jamaica, here we come, we'll just stay in our way. I'll look up to the market outside, bitch. I'm gonna phone y'all, don't need no boy.
