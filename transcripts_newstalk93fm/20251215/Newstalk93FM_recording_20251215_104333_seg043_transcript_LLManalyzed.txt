20251215 104333 Thank you so much for having me. MP caretaker. We know MP caretaker over there in East Portland. All right. Thanks a lot, madam. All right. So that's, I'm sorry. Darrell Vaz is the member of parliament for Eastern Portland, and he's also the Minister of Ministry of Transport. We have one MP at a time. So it's actually Daryl Vaz. I think he has gone into his fourth term as MP. All right, and indeed, that's so. So let's see what will happen there. And we hope that whatever breach may have taken place on this particular bus, we hope that it don't happen on any other, all right? Because we want the safety of our children. Hello, welcome, Carla. Morning, Conrad. Yeah, man, morning. How you doing? I hope them get a lawyer for the girl that quit. Yes, we hope so.
