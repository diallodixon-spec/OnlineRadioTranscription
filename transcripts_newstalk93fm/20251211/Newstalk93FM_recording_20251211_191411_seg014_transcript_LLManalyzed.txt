2025-12-12 13:17:12 I feel pretty Just somebody that can make me feel Safe, yeah, look I thought we were a couple But nobody ever made me feel Safe, like you bet Cause when I'm with you I know I'm fine You take all the pressure off my mind All the time, patient and kind Will not be going out my mind Say from the problems I don't worry Cause I'm hard to find I'm from the block, baby It's you and, baby. If the world turn against me, who I got, baby? Let's get you up, baby. Up in the block, baby, I'm talking up, up, up. Baby, I know I can show you right now. Yeah, yeah. I feel it right at home, safe in your arms, baby. Come hold me down, come hold me down, huh? Save like a key and a lock on me. Save like a crib with a combo, please. Hold you down. Hold you down, down, down. I can put my guard down. I can pull my heart out. Love you around. Love you around, huh? Unplug the alarm now, so you won't mind.
