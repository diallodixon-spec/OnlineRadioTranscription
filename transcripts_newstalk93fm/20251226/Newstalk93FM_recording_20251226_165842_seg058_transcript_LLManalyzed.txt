20251226 165842 Christmas traditions that we know and love. Engage in the stories if you can visit the platform, look at the images, listen to the audio so the stories are both written and there's voice over and then discuss your own family traditions, maybe create a new family tradition and make the most of this time together but remember that when you're doing these types of activities intentionally you're helping to encourage brain development and prevent any sort of Christmas slide. Every day presents different learning opportunities and the Christmas season is very special and we know it takes on even more meaning this year, given all that has transpired and all the loss that many families have felt. The coming together of families makes it even more important this year. We want families to be mindful of seizing these learning opportunities through play. Play is a simple. Anybody can do it at any time, for any length of time, any age, no huge experience necessary. That's it for this feature. Thanks so much for tuning in.
