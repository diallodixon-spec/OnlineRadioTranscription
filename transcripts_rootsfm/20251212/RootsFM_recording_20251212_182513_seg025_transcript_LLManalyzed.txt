20251212 182513 You false prophet, leading the children astray. If you stop it, throw some money rocket for putting in your pocket. Give the people water for carrying a basket. So which you find yourself for the instrumental influence. Anytime you use it, use your conscience. Decide what you sow. It is no accident. And none of you, none of you, you shall escape the judgment. And watch where you teach your little children. Make sure there's something to hurt them. As if you mind what you're saying to me, doctor. Because is the truth, we will find out. And you are judged by the fruit if you teach them to shoot and don't prostitute. Tomorrow man and woman is the youth of today.
