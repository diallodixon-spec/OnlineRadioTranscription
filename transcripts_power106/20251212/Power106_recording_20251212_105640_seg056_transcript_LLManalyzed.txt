2025-12-12 11:11:26 Good morning to both of you, man. I'm going to ask a question, though. The Bank of Jamaica doesn't have any control over inflation when there's a job but again you can't be so narrowly focused as somebody who's in charge of a central bank to see an economy not doing the right thing and you're kind of just over there you know doing your thing that is not that is not helpful to the economy no i i i believe and i think in that inflation driven by supply and demand on rising prices. Yeah, man, and then there's all the sort of thing, the Marcelian thing about decreasing cost to scale, yeah, and increasing cost to scale. The lower your level of production is the higher the cost of production, yeah.
