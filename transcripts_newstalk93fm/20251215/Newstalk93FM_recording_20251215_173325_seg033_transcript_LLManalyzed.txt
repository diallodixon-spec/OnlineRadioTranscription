It's never gonna last I thought my house was haunted I used to live with ghosts And all the perfect couples Said when you know, you know And when you don't, you don't And all of the folks and all of the friends Seen it before, they'll see it again Life is a song, it ends when it ends I was wrong But my mama told me it's alright You were dancing through the light
