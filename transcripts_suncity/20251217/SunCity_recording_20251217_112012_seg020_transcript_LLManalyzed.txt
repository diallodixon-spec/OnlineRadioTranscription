20251217 112012 Smile on me, what a sweet, sweet relief. What a sweet relief. Yeah. Yeah, I'm building my muscle up. Yeah, I am strong enough to overcome, to rise above anything. I am stronger than any mountain. When I say move, they get out my way. And I'm wiser, learning and changing, growing stronger, stronger and wiser. Stronger with every step, wiser ways, every breath. There is nothing I cannot do. Nothing shall be impossible, cause I'm stronger.
