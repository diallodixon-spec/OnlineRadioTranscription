Good afternoon to you. We'll see Latoya later on. Welcoming the Walsum Park Massive every time. Zane? Zane? Oh boy, let's give thanks for another beautiful day. It's a thankful Thursday and we have so much to be thankful for. So much to be thankful, so we continue to give thanks, right? You know, we do our cliff moment soon, but we're going to take a pause for the cause because we're going to have news and brief at 15 minutes after the hour of, you know, 15 minutes after the 10 o'clock. All right. So soon go taking a pause. You're listening.
