20251231 124631 This kiss, this kiss Unstoppable, this kiss, this kiss Cinderella, such a snow white How does love get so off course? All I wanted was a white knight With a good heart, soft touch, fast horse Ride me off into the sunset Baby, I'm forever yours It's the way you love me It's a feeling like this It's some trivial motion It's perpetual bliss It's that pivotal moment It's a unthinkable This kiss, this kiss Unthinkable, this kiss, this kiss You can kiss me in the moonlight On the rooftop under the sky You can kiss me with the windows open While the rain comes pouring inside
