20251216 214128 Mr. Mackenzie, let me tell you. Mark Road from the police station, as far as Oxford Road, that's where Moscow is, sir, right? I tried to get the mail of Spanish town, because the English, they dominate two-quarter of the road, and the coast of them dominate the other part. So, as a matter of fact, I wouldn't call it a near miss, it was a minor accident, yes to me, because somebody was trying to go up, right, from down the police station going towards Mashco. And they must park right at the entrance in front of Mariston Street. And then the person was going across the road and a taxi was coming from where to go inside the park. And it was too far. That's't far that's why i say it's not a near miss but mr mckenzie when you think about the border from berkwood right and berkwood it's for less than 16 feet and then the i don't represent the parish counts authorize the eagerness them to do
