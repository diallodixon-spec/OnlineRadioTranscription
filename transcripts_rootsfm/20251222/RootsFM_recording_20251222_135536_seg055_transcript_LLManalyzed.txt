20251222 135536 is a solstice. Yeah, we're into the winter season right now. So it's a winter solstice is where we're at right about now. So choose self-pursuits where the king and the queen reside. Hug up yourself, love up yourself, bless up yourself. Love your country, no man. Bless your country and stop badmouthing your country. And what about Mama Africa? I'm talking about the Congo. I'm talking about Nigeria, Botswana, Zimbabwe. I'm talking about Egypt, Ethiopia. Coming up on the 11th of January, it's the Ethiopian Christmas. Okay, so you for being here. I could not do it without you. I appreciate love every minute, every second, every hour of your time. Yes, I do.
