20260102 200708 We must be in paradise When last you had the time to remember He's only bum but a fender And the drinks can't go big or deep or tender When last you've been to a party Plenty women looking so nice We must be in Paradise When last you had a time to remember Just last night All in tongue is traffic Girl, you are the greatest You'll always be me favorite No matter what we face it, don't worry at all We go in places, on all the biggest stages We on the road to greatness, y'all In one, two, three, hey I don't need no traffic jam, need no traffic jam
