20251222 090807 I'm calling all masqueraders, any values we type I have something that I want to tell you, in a while on the mind We're sharing this road together, it stays not too far behind This one goes out to every fetter, to discuss your behavior When you reach the road, get on like you're catched at the beach Advertise the mode, jump up cause it's one family Deep under the air, inside the air pumped up by me Displaying weself itself Like we don't care about nobody Out on the road, all by the stage All in the fire, we're all by the trap Out on the road all on the stage All by the trap, we're all meeting up Drop your location, tell me where you want me find you With no hesitation, I'll leave and you in, I'll find you Drop your location, show me where you wanna find me With no hesitation, make me by your side We're ready for the ride We are.
