20251229 113319 What I'm trying to say is that this caused me so much pain Feeling like I've got no control over my own brain When it's sad to see that you don't seek it's driving me insane Leave me alone, oh yes Right here now, no for them to get blocked and delete You're playing mode out of life,'re so sweet. Come and ring off me line, seven days at the week. I'm enough for right now, I'm enough for sweet. Leela beg you this, Leela beg you that. Hey, shut your shh. Hey, cut the crap. 2020 now, certain things we stop, so we disappear to the habitat, cause everybody's trying to talk to me, but nobody wanna hear me out. Everybody's got some things to say, honestly, then just I'll move them out. The things I say I'm darling you with. Leave me alone, leave me alone.
