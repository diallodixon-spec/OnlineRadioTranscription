20251225 134823 I don't care about the present Underneath the Christmas tree I just want you for my own More than you could ever know Make my wish come true All I want for Christmas You I don't want a lot for Christmas There is just one thing I need And I don't care about the presents Underneath the Christmas tree I don't need to hang my stockings There upon the fireplace
