20260101 141717 Yes, we know it hurt them But then again, that's such a planet Tell them to take a seat, they can't stand here Remember, say you can't spend time even if you're not buying nothing Remember, say the world don't own a guy, no, no There are no guarantees, but you'll still try some, huh? Or you'll feel jumpin' and the gates wide open, huh? Work with the chicken if you can't buy more, no And that's my nigga, he can't write, we don't know. We don't read it, we don't do nothing. We don't mess with people and that is fine. You don't hear a call up, we don't mix up. Remember, you don't take nothing for your ratchet flight Them you throw money with a rifle like my dick bike Imagine that, simple like a office guy Because you never buy, use your brain, sell a chance and you don't have to buy Don't worry man, you will spend time, better you never buy, no no Remember say the world don't own a guy, no no, they don't own a garage
