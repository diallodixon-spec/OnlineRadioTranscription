However, it seemed to have given O&M a lift as Herard Francetti put them in front in the first half of stoppage time. Mount Pleasant brought on striker Warner Brown at the start of the second half and he found the equaliser in the 62nd minute although he had to wait on a VAR review. At this stage, Mount Pleasant were back in the lead on aggregate but the tide switched 7 minutes later when Jalen Alasagaste put O&M in front on the away goals rule. But with three minutes to go substitute Tariq Magui delivered the telling blow that changed everything in the history books for Mount Pleasant who were crowned the Caribbean Cup champions. It means the title stays in Jamaica following Cavalier's victory last season.
