============================================================

roughly about 85% of our mobile sites are back online. But when we probably just if it take maybe a minute or two to just expand on that might be a bit more useful for the listeners. So after a natural disaster, we're going to a couple of phases. So we'll do an assessment and immediate recovery. So we are just over a month in. So assess all of the sites. And this is the mobile network. Dion, I'm just going to focus on the mobile for one second. So the mobile networks, we have 925 sites across Jamaica. So assess them. So do they have power? If not, has the generator kicked in? Is the generator working? All the usual checks. Is the site integrity still intact? Is it still standing? Have the radios blown off? Are the radios misaligned? So we go through a huge assessment. We also in the same trends look at restoring as many of them as we quickly as we can do.
