20251222 191709 I don't believe the government, the urgency that is needed of the government. I'm not feeling it. And I'm hearing just some Jamaicans are criticizing the people, that the people they are looking and doubt, and they're not doing anything to help themselves. People must try and work in the shoes of those people, you know. If you lose your house, you lose your job. If you have a little fee where you used to depend on people to give you food, and you lose all of those things. Not us. When you say the state, I mean the host, you know. Now the rest of the society must come to your assistance, man. No, absolutely. So people can't be said can't be said, said by the people, the people must try and help them. Try and help them and say, oh, when you lost everything, you lose your house, you lose everything, you have lost. Where you must start from, what you must do.
