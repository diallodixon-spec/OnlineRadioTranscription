20251216 092217 It's not about being recognized, it's not about recognition, but it's about the impact that you've made and encourage them to continue to make that impact. And I encourage all the officers within the JCPOA establishment is about 14,000. You know, looking on to that winner, be resolved in the sense that this competition could have only chose one. However, we have 14,000 plus top cops that won't just have the title, but they'll be within the capacity of their responsibility to top cops within themselves. Thank you, thank you so much and all the best to you as you continue your work within Cassava Peace and I'm sure communities across Jamaica as you continue to work with integrity. Thank you so much for your service Corporal Thompson and all the best you as you continue. Your work. Thank you. All right. That was the last question.
