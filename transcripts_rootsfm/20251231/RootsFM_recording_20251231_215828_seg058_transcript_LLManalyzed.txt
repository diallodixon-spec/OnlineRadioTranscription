20251231 215828 I can't say goodbye to you. No matter how I try, you're such a part of me. Without you, I would not be in the heart of me. I know that you and I were meant to be forever I can't tell you goodbye Who knows what we choose When we choose the ones we love Who knows what we do The things we do When we're in love I know that you're a decent man and you try to do what's fair But how can I forget all the feelings we have shared
