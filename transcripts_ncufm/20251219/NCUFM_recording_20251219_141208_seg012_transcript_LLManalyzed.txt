20251219 141208 Today today is an accomplished day. That's what I'll describe today as accomplished And there is more to come Today is the shortened edition of the drive Today where we take a moment to rewind to reflect and remember the moments, the music and the memories that shaped who we are today. Flashback Friday reminds us that while we can't live in the past, we can learn from it. Lessons we learned, songs we love or loved and the experiences that we survived, they all play a role into molding us who we are now yeah molding us into who we are now and sometimes looking back helps us to move forward with more wisdom more gratitude and more purpose
