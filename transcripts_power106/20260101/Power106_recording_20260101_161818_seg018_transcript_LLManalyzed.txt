20260101 161818 I've been planning this evening for a long, long time I even tried to write you a song that wouldn't run So I stick to what I know I'm good at I'm gonna give it all that I've got I'm gonna be a selfish lover tonight Cause I don't wanna go out tonight I just wanna stay right here and love you I don't wanna share it tonight I just want to stay right here and love you. I don't want to show you too much. I just want to stay right here and love you, right here and love. Your friends keep calling. They want to take you out.
