20251212 160807 Thank you so much for your time. of the woods we will use our resources to communicate with the stakeholders and let's see if we can get a speedy resolution here or nay or any resolution at all sometimes it does work brilliantly other times it may not be as speedy but this time I'm very happy that we had a very speedy resolution to that issue and thanks once again to Delano Williams from the National Water Commission and the team from the NWC. We know you're oppressed at this time but we thank you for taking our query, dealing with it quite speedily and we thank you so much for your service.
