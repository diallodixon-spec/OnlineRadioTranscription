Broken heart is just emotion that's taking me over Tied up in sorrow, lost in my soul But if you don't come back, come home to me, darling You know that there'll be nobody left in this world to kiss goodnight. Good night. Good night. Oh, baby Got the sun in the morning, I got the moon at night I've got your arms around me, everything's alright Holding you tight is how I like to spend the rest of my life
