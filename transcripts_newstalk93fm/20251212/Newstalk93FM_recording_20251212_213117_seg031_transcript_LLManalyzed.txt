20251212 213117 The spirit of me feeling good! I have a lightning spirit Early in the morning I'm at it Me cooler ready, my eyes done ready Me punching that's automatic I have a lightning jumbie A kind of energy inside me And it ready for the rum, ready, ready for the rum Ready, ready, for the rum Ready for the action, a spiritual encounter So let we go. Let we go down the road. Let we go. It's action time, there we go Is back on our time there we go Hands up! This sweating spirit havin' me feelin' good!
