You are the beginning. You will surely be the last. My whole world starts and ends with you. You are the Alpha. You are the Omega. Oh, there is nothing, there is nothing that can take your place. Oh, when I think about all you've done for me, how you came and made my life complete. If it had not been for the Lord on my side, Oh, without you, Lord, I surely would have died. I have nothing, absolutely, positively nothing. I have nothing.
