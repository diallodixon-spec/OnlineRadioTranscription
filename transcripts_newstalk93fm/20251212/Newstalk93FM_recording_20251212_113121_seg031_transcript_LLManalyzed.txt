20251212 113121 I don't live my life with regrets, no I come to jam on a bumper, come to drink on the liquor Until my head's gone and I'm miserable All down on the ground, I'm causing trouble Look how the security are watching me They don't know I'm out there At this much of a big place, I'm a defect like a jumbo And to what way? They don't want me in their party, no They don't want, they don't want me in there for a seeded They don't want me cause I chew on the way They don't want in there for seeded I don't listen, nothing to say Every fact I draw, jumping up Doing what I want, jumping up Tell them I ain't leaving, right there sleeping Every fact I draw Jumping up, doing what I want Jumping up, tell them I ain't living, right there sleeping They say I'm too out of control
