You would have heard the teachers coming out and speaking about their situation, and there would have been some further improvements where they have called back persons who would have retired to come and give back some, you know, knowledge and impetus to the education system. But right now, what we are seeking to do is to get the data and expertise in bargaining from our global union federation so we are able to properly align and negotiate for improved pay and we're tying pensions with it as well so that we're not negotiating in the dark and we have a basis from which to start or restart that negotiating process for pay and pensions and other working conditions. So it gives us some real-time comparative data on public sector compensation. We have also looped in digital transformation.
