2025-12-11 22:29:41 ready and able to serve in the capacities that we will be serving in because we know that we will be out there with you during the holiday period. Be safe as you traverse the streets and please remember that your safety is our number one priority. This is the program JSAFE. I want to say thanks to our assistant production team at the Jamaica Constabulary Force Communication Network and our technical operator Mr. Kenneth Reed. Join us again for another episode of JSAFE Now. Have a great night. I am DSP Aflindo. Can I stop the laughing? These past few weeks have felt different for many of us. But through it all, one thing remains. Together, we rebuild.
