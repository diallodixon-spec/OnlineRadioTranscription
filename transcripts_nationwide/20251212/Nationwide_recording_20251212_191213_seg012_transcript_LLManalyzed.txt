So, ladies and gentlemen, I want to thank you for your attention. I hope that there has been some elucidation of government policy, that you have a better understanding of the direction where we want to go. Yes, it is going to be a challenging future, but you have good government that understands the challenges, and we have put policies in place. You have your personal challenges as well, but you should know that the government understands, the government cares, and the government is acting as quickly as possible to relieve the pain and suffering that you have in your personal daily and your household responsibilities. So ladies and gentlemen, I thank you so much for your attention.
