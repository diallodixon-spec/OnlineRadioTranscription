We don't talk anymore Like we used to do I just heard you found the one you've been looking You've been looking for I wish I would've known that wasn't me Cause even after all this time I still wonder Why I can't move on Just the way brain Oh, it's such a shame We don't talk anymore, we don't talk anymore
