Life it's a journey, it's a long race Mama says son be wise and don't bring disgrace So me take off the broom and start sweep the place Cause all these waste they got to get erased A love to me people that me embrace The truth of the truth and I can't erase So hell to all of those who want hate Just send me to finish this race So we ain't giving up now We put up a fight, we Got to be ready Cause time's getting dreary Just said don't you worry I ain't a worry, long We got to be ready, or else I'm getting jaded So we pray, we pray We pray, we pray
