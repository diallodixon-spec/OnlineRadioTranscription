20260101 091611 My friend, it was a misunderstanding. So if I took it for granted, then I promise I'm through there. I go drunk, like I never drunk. Wave like I never wave. Wind like I never wind before. Just to show you I'm sorry. I'm sorry. And I need you back in my life. You got people by the truck. Emotions running high. We underpin the sky. Tears running down we eye. Can't you tell that we sorry? We sorry. And we need you back in with I, I need back, I'm back. Come on to me, come on to me
