20251224 205626 Oh Christmas Day Every little child on Santa's knee has room for your love Underneath that tree Give love on Christmas Day Oh Christmas Day No greater gift is ever loved The world needs love And the world needs more love Why don't you give love on Christmas Day? The man who was creeping the couple upstairs Only to know there's someone who cares Give love on Christmas. What goes around comes around. It's time for the sheer love and care though. For the better 2020s.
