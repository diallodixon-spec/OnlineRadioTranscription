20260101 164239 I love you when nobody else. In and out my life. Come and go. Leaving just your picture behind. And I kissed it a thousand times. With just my finger or with your eye. I come running to you Until I tear you right from the screen And there's nothing that I can do Can't help myself No, I can't help myself, no, I can't help myself Oh, don't you hug a boy when he won't show up I'm weaker than a man should be Can't help myself
