20251215 120707 The venue could handle this jammin' But like when the man go high, we gon' rip it up a spike Oh lord, goodbyes and party, we love it Sweet woman, we have it Greatest on the planet, boy Somebody radio loud playin' a song and it goes enough up And if I lose myself inside this place, well I show my shit up If this hoes got unblast when the beat just pass, the madness ones up. Just give me one more shot inside my glass and watch me level up. Fitting like a hero. Call me hero. As I raise my hand, I leave the bad vibes on zero. Fiting like a hero. Soak a hero. As soon as I reach the dance I leave my conduct on zero Fetting Like a Hero Fetting Like A Hero
