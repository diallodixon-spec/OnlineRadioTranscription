20251222 181814 When I'm gone, I'll make you nervous If you hurt me, I deserve it I've been acting foolishly Forgetting what you are You start loving me, I know this But even chaos serves a purpose It feels good to love somebody And somebody loves you back So don't give in to your dreams, boy Cause I'll'll be here for a lifetime. You don't have to pretend to bow because it's crystal clear now, now. Guess it's bye to the good times. And I'll be gone by the sunrise. I'll be better on my own. I'll better on my own, now, now. Nobody should call my phone, nobody should call my my phone, na-na This is my last heartbreak song, na-na
