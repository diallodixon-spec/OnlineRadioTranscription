20251216 150303 It's a fantastic season, only at Wendy's. Vision 2030 Jamaica. Take away yourself from trouble. From trouble, yeah. Cause it come in a double. Uh-huh. Take away yourself. From trouble. From trouble. I say, mind the sinking sandals. Take away yourself, from trouble, yeah. Rebuild in Jamaica. Cause it come, in a double. Take away, take away, yourself, from trouble. Interesting. You're not live twice, yo. Follow the road on the righteous path. Still focus and can't just put you in your tatters, eh. But when you're wicked, them corrupt your heart. Do the right thing, become the one you say you're salt. Take away yourself from trouble, from trouble, eh. Because it come in a double, eh. Take away yourself.
