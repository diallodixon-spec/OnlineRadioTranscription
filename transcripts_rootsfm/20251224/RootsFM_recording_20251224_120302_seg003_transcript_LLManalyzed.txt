20251224 120302 a time to seek communion, express gratitude, and strengthen faith in the Father God. Dear God, our everlasting Father, we thank you for this special moment, a time when we come into your presence to commune with you. There are so many desperate situations that we are faced with. And as we pause for prayer this morning, this day, this night, we believe that your ears are not heavy, so you may not hear us. We know that as we pray, we believe that there is a way that we can seek your face and get answers. We believe that we can seek Your favor, Almighty God.
