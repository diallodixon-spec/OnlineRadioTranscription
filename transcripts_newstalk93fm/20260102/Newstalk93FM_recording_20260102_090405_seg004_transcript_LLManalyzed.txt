Somebody radio loud, playin' a song, and it goes enough up. And if I lose myself inside this place, well, I'll show my shit up. If this hoes caught on glass, when the pictures pass, the madness ones up. Just give me one more shot inside my glass and watch me level up. Fitting like a hero. Call me hero. As I raise my hand, I'll leave the bad vibes on zero. Fitting like hero. Soaker hero. As soon as I reach the dance, I'll leave my conduct on zero. Betting like a hero. Oh, oh, oh, oh. Oh, betting like a hero. Oyo, oyo, oyo.
