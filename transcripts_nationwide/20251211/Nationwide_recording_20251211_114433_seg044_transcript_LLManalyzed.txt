People, come October next year 2026, these two couples, Cian Barnswell, Councillor of the Hill Division, and his wife, Mrs. Barnswell, B. Andy Hannah Rolls, um, that are Tyrone. Too many of our children are going missing without a trace. Right? I have a little girl too, and it pains my heart when I see children of this kind. Our children of any age group have gone without a trace Tyrone. They are precious, they are innocent. So I am calling upon the government and the Governor General's Office and the people in charge in charge to take the names of Brother Tyrone to make sure Cian Barnes will be honored for this wonderful work he has done. I want to say something, Brother Tyrone.
