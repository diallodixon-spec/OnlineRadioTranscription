20251229 120607 They know I'm here cause I do one way They know I'm in there for a city I don't listen to nothing they say Every fat ass drunk, jumping up Doing what I want, jumping up Tell them I ain't leaving, right they are sleeping Every fat ass drunk Jumping my head gone And I'm miserable All down on the ground I'm causing trouble Look how the security watch me They don't know about me I just mushed up in place under these fat legged chumbe And don't wait They don't want me in their paracetamol
