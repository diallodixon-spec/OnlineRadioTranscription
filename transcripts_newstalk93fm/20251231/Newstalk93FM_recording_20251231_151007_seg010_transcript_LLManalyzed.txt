20251231 151007 As I lay my bed with my head to the ceiling Say I'm drowning alone and I'm lost in my feelings Somebody send me a sign cause you know that I need it Can't even come back to me cause you know, you're my healing Show me love, wind up and show me love. Together till we all be in love. Show me love wind up show me love. So come if we show up together. No place that I'd rather be. Show up together. Right now is our energy. Show up together, so come is our power to win.
