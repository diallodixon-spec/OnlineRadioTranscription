Sippin' on a good time, you ain't got a risk, they can put it on me When they wanna go home, they know all my money sure I don't ever get it one way, yeah It's better than I get it same day, but hey I didn't that I don't play, streets not safe But I never run away, even when I'm away OT, OT, there's never much love when we go OT I pray to make it back in one piece, I pray, I pray That's why I need a one dance, got a Hennessy in my hand
