20251226 095736 I'll take you out on a night cruise On a yacht, just can't lose Cause we got a lot to look forward to One, two, what you gonna do? What good is a diamond nobody can see? I hear we got you on lockdown But I got the master key I light a thousand candles all around Show me to the stuff we all go down Nothing can be sweeter than the sound of making love Baby when I start can't stop. I'll hold you from the bottom to the top. Nothing is forbidden when we touch, baby. Yeah, yeah.
