20251222 144937 Don't go, hey man, I need your love Me nah break your heart a second time Give me the blame, can you hold out your time? I really, really love you Can you see me love you? The best healer in the life, will you know that at time Before you press forward, make me hit the rewind Can me love you? You one you love and you don't want to hurt But love gets on your nerves It's not like my wiki
