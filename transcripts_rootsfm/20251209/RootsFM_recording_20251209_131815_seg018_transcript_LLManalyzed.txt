Let's go, let's go! God know it's like oats that sell concrete and chard boat box damn cheap Me no see no better buy again a beer boobin and lit up on the coal groin inna the damn street Me happy all any time when me see them ya ting ya wonder how cover men sleep God know me not do kissy kissy but when me see them ting ya me haffi kissy kissy Watch and style ya, nuff get a use them a dead in a row Mother blood me see shed in a row Shrimp off me a cut hundred in a row This tree's spreading all over.
