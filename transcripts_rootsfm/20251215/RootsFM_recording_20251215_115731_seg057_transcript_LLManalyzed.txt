20251215 115731 I pray for the nations salvation, not just for economic growth and development, but for the nations salvation in the mighty name of Jesus. Let the blood of your son Jesus Christ wash away all our sins and as you're promising your word that if we confess that you are faithful and just to forgive. Thank you, Father, for this moment of prayer and may every word from our hearts today. Oh, God, come up to you as a sweet Saviour and your blessing will remain with us as a nation. In Jesus' mighty name we pray and we tell the thanks, Father. Amen. Thank you so very much, Bishop Dr. Michael Webster, for per always a welcoming voice and the words that you speak on our behalf to the Lord God we always accept and thank you.
