20251224 205827 Without a holiday But it's for a reason Preparing for this special season It's the time of year To spread love and good cheer To everyone To everyone There's no place I'd rather be Than spending time with the family This Christmas, this Christmas Watching the kids wait by the tree To open gifts from you and me This Christmas, yeah Everybody needs love Spread a little love, spread a little love This is no time for no fighting or quarrel All who are family and friends are foreign I send down food and closing a bar
