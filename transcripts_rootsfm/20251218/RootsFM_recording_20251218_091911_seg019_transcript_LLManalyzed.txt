20251218 091911 I love the fact that you're rude. Not to mention you're cute. She's a carpenter in the party. She's in the weather but the glue. It's real warm when I pass through. Non-skilful like you. If you don't mind me asking, to knock me twice in your groove. When I'm whining on the road. Don't let the music load. I could never let you go. See you again. Oh, they truly might have dreaming. Yeah.
