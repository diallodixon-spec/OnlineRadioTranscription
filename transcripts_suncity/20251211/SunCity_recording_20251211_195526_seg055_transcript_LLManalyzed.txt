2025-12-12 13:36:41 I miss you so much and I don't know what to say. I should be over you. I should know better, but it's just life. It's a city, baby. We're scorching. It's been six months, eight days, 12 hours since you've been with me. I want to be the face you see when you close your eyes I wanna be the touch you need every single night I wanna be your fantasy And be your reality And everything between I want you to need me Like the air you breathe I want you to feel me In every breath
