You taught me really You keep me going around and all the time Oh yes, the time You let me come Still I keep on wasting my time, swing My time All I want to say is let me come The right time, swing right by It isn't much that I've asked For it's high time, say it's my time Say it's right time Believe, cause I just instantly feel it You know it's got me reeling It keeps me going around all the time, time, all the time
