So all the time you were in high school, was law your focus and was music a hobby or did at any point you think boy I still want bussing on music? I never thought I wanted to bussing on the music at the time. My mum, she is very adamant about me having some sort of job in the professional sector. I've always been interested in doing law. I mean, I don't know if this happens for everybody, but what really inspired me, it was two things really. It was the community I'm from and how I saw things happen there and TV shows. I used to watch a lot of Law and Order and the people who were victimized, who were going through all sorts of injustices, it was, what would you call it, like a ray of hope.
