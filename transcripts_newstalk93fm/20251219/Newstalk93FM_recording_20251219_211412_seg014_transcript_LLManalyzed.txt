20251219 211412 Yeah, let's know what we found Hopeless hallelujah Hopeless side of heaven's gate Oh, my life, I'll do ya Breathe it, take my breath away At your altar, I will pray You're the sculptor, I'm the clay Oh, my my, my, you're taking me out from the ordinary. I want you laying me down till we're dead and buried. On the edge of your knife, staying drunk on your vibe. The angels up in the clouds are jealous, knowing we've found something so ordinary. You got me kissing the ground, sanctuary. Share with me what you've done, will love return me to dust? The angels up in clouds are jealous now
