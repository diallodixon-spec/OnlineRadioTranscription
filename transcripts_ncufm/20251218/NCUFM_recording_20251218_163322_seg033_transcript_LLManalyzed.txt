20251218 163322 talking Japanese today. I have a student at the University of the West Indies Mona Campus, Math and Chemistry Tutor, Musician, Christian, and the President of the UWI Japanese Club, Mr. Theodore Jones, the man himself. Welcome to the front seat of the bus on the drive. How are you doing my good sir? Good afternoon host, I'm doing well. I don't want greetings compared to us. Why is that? Yeah, you're absolutely correct.
