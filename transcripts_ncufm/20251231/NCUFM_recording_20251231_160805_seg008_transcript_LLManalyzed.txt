There are some, not just high school, but also primary school. I know that there's, I think, Davis Primary right here in Old Harbour. They have a journalism club and they had reached out to me to give them some tips as well. And it is things like that, you know, we know we have to also you know expose them to as early as possible to get those individuals because they are out there who have a passion for this particular profession. The other challenge though is to know how do you retain them. I remember when I covered the 2007 World Cup when I was at the Observer, my editor at the time was Garfield Myers, who is now the editor at large for the Jamaica Observer for the South Central Bureau. And, you know, we met journalists who they were just purely freelancing. Yeah.
