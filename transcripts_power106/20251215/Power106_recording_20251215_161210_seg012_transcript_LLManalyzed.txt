20251215 161210 Thank you for the call. The word is love and enjoy the rest of your day. You too, the word is love. And I want, I would like, church man come from the road and clarify and show that he's not a Christian and church man is not in a position to say that is a shame for a man to be along here. He's a Christian. Have a nice evening again, Jesse. All the very best to you. Take care. Rastafari Aliv, yeah? Rastafari aliv every time. Have a nice evening again Jesse. Paul addressed to the Christian church in Corinth. Yes, while Paul is the primary author, the letters that form the books of Corinthians were a part of a larger correspondence. That's the information we're seeing here.
