20251231 194128 You can count my grace I just say my lane, my lane Me no get the time for the hate and the bad energy Cause my mind on my money Make you dance like broccoli Steady green like broccoli Steady on my grind don't hear what they want Telling me good enough my fantasy Don't want to check if my tap in the rush But see the rush, see they rush Where will it be much? Now I gotta make my tap, see they rush They come on and we touch, yeah See they rush See they rush where will it be much We'll be hype everybody they cross There's no joining with us
