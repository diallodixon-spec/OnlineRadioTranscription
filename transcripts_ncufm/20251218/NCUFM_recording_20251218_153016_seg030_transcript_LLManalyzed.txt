It's a vibrant red plant that is more than just a seasonal favorite. You know, for me personally, my sorrel has to have some ginger in it, you know. Sometimes I'll even have it unsweetened, just fresh out the pot That's just me that's just me. That's just me But it doesn't only taste good, it's good for you Now sorry
