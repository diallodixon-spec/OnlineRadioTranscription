What do you do if you're the government man? Do you just give curry and the maroons the material as he asked for and they just do the building themselves or Do you stand your ground and say no man? If we're giving you these materials, you're gonna let the JDF in and they're gonna help you rebuild What would you know which one works which one is the best way which one's the most amicable but most sensible sensible solution? That's the real question here. DJ Perry says he can't have it both ways. See it there? It has to be one or the other, man. What's it gonna be? Is it gonna be material with no JDF or material with JDF? Because there has to be material, yeah? The government has committed to helping rebuild a compound. So there has to be a material one way or another. But the question is the material by itself or the material with the JDF? Why is Corrie against the JDF? says Shan amazingly bless. And again, it's also important to note that it's not Corrie specifically.
