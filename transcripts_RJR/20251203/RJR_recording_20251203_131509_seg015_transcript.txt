When did you kisses get so sweet, baby? It's such a sweet surprise for me to look into your eyes. And I see you in a different light. Candlelight. Moonlight. I see you when a different light, candlelight, moonlight. I see you with a different way, a different light. And sometimes, I see you like I've never seen you before.
