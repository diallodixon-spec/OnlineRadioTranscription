And what I say to all my students is this, in the way how the world is changing at a rapid pace, you want to set yourself on par with an advantage. All right. You want to give yourself a fighting chance, a chance to be able to come out on top and win. and win now Michael Let's say that you and I do exactly the same job and we are equally well, you know We perform well at it, but let's say that you speak Spanish or a foreign language and I don't So that could literally be the difference between you looking at a salary off and I don't know what the salaries I'm just giving a random figure here you know let's say you're looking at about five hundred thousand dollars because you have the second language but I'm looking at about sixty thousand dollars because I don't so it gives you an opportunity to tap into the global marketplace and get the top dollar okay all
