Look at us now, watching movies from the same couch. Finally, she loves, she loves me now. And I believe somehow we're in the perfect place. Finally, she's always up for the ride And she likes to be up in the hills Far away from the noise when she just wanna chill She wants to hear the birds and bees when they sing And I'm glad that she does cause it's my kind of thing
