I can't make you proud. I put it down the right the right way Yeti steps make a boy won't try me Slim waist, pretty face, get behind me, behind me We'll change positions You take a hold on me I'm having visions Of you getting down with me And I know, and I know you've been watching me all night you keep moving right i'ma let you take control oh why down for you oh just don't leave me dancing on my own i'm gonna let you take control
