20251229 091310 All I think of is you Even when you look at my boo You know I'm crazy for you I see all out when you lookin' I never say a word I know how n***a thought I can trip and I heard about the girls There's no way in the lake I'll fight over no day As you can see, but I like your steezy style You're holdin' me to do it You come through and holla and swoop me in his two-seater. Now that's gangsta. And I got special ways to thank you. But don't're putting it on me.
