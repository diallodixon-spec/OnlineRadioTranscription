20251222 161809 again and to receive your lovely present of two turtle doves. You really are too kind. At first the partridge was very jealous and suspicious of the doves and they had a terrible row on the night the doves arrived. We had to send for the vet but the birds are okay again and the stitches is due to come out in a week or two. The vet's bill was eight pound but the mother is over her annoyance now and the doves and the partridge are watching the telly from the pear tree as Thanking you for your kindness, I remain your govenant.
