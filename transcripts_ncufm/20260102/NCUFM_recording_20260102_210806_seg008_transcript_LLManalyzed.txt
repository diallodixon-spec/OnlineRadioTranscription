20260102 210806 Come rescue your way Home in the morning In the afternoon time Late in the evening he'll be there When your heart is broken And you feel discouraged You can just remember that he's there. He'll be there. When I go with Jesus, I'll take the blood of God. Heaven, I'm going with God. Bless me with the blood of Jesus.
