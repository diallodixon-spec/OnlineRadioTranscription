So today I was in the Amden-New Cargain, and then I noticed that there is water starting to restore back to these communities as in Bounty of Amden and New Cargain, but there's some bus pipe on the road coming down from New Cargain to Amden. So that is really the difference now. But outside of that, we're over here and we're happy to be back and well and alive and to can speak as much as that are of great importance to you and the region as well. Thank you very much. Thank you for always keeping up. You had a community report out there. You, you, you take that job. E-Central. Alrick. E-central is gone. Alrick. Hi, good evening.
