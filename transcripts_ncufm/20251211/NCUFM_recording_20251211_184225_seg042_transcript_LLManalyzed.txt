2025-12-12 11:38:06 feel it like my strength is gone but don't freeze to call my own and no one to call on the phone I will lift my hands and call and press his name cause he's always been there and the poverty never changed the tears dripping down my face I put on the garment of praise cause my ways are not his way and my thoughts are too slated away I will sing the song bless the Lord I will praise you even more I will bless you The one I'm living for I will bless you You're the one I adore I will bless you On Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday Thursday, Friday, Saturday I will bless you Thursday all day and year I will bless you Cause I know I got a reason I will bless you To give you all bed, I will bless the Lord.
