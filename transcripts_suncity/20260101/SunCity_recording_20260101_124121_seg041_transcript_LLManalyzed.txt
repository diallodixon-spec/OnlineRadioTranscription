20260101 124121 I'll keep you safe, I'll stand beside you on our own. I will cross the ocean for you. I will go to bring you love. I will be your hero, your strength, anything you need. And I will be your hero, your strength, anything you need. I will be the sun in your sky. I will light your way for all time. Promise you, for you I will. For you I will lay my life on the line For you I will fight For you I will die
