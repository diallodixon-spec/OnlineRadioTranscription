I'm inspired what love is all about. Girl, I can't live without your love. Two kisses for you. That's an anew. Heaven is on my side. Forever we are two separate stars sharing one common light you're the one and the prize you're the winner you're the light I love you higher than anyone can count. No way into the amount of love I have. And you inspire when love is all about your life.
