20251231 163932 Venezuela has 31 million people. Five million leave the country for a reason of disquiet.

It means to them that it's not one Vietnam they are going into. It's 100 Vietnam. It means that the U.S. will be bogged down in that area for many years. And I used to say to the Prime Minister Trinidad, just bear in mind that she can be charged and taken to the egg and tried for a crime against humanity. She used to bear that in mind.
