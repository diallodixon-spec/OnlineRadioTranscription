============================================================

We come from the twin island of Calabas Oh Lord, it's we who create party And we love plenty Bacchanal Lord Lord So don't tell me nothing When still bad knocking And start the jam, jam, jam Me whole waist high knocking I feel it, the wine on something Inside the barn Every man roll on to a woman and we shout it And when they talk about jump up and cool off, turn up, pick up, girl, turn up the waves and callin' me name.
