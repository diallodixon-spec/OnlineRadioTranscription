20251223 190907 Despite this small number of children who are raised speaking Esperanto, it doesn't grow that way. It grows by people who are devoted to it and feel that it's worth their time. It's completely done out of love and fun. I don't know a word of Esperanto and I wonder if you could indulge me and sort of teach me some of the polite phrases that I like to learn when I go on holiday, have to say hello, how to say thank you, please, goodbye. We say salutons, which is hello, salutons. Salutons? Salutons. We say bonvenons, which is welcome. Sounds like bienvenue, right? Welcome. Bonvenons. We say donkons, which is thank you. And the other other person says nedankinda. It's not worthy of a thank you. You know, it means denada, right? Nedankinda. How would I say Merry Christmas to somebody? Have a good Christmas. Have a good holiday.
