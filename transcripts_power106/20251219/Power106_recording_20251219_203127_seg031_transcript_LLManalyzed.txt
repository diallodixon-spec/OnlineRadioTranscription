20251219 203127 Amid the celebrations, safety must remain a top priority. On today's Get The Facts, we share ways you can keep yourself safe both at home and on the road. As we prepare to decorate our homes, it is important to exercise caution when installing and using Christmas lights in order to reduce the risk of fires during the festive season. It's important to check each set of lights, new or old, for broken or cracked sockets, frayed or bare wires, or loose connections. If you recognize that the lights are damaged, throw them out. You should also limit the amount of lights that you plug into one outlet. So when you plug one into a socket, that provides a plug-in. It's either on the plug-in section itself that you plug in, or it provides an extension. I've seen some of them where they provide an extension on the lights for you to plug other lights in. What that does is that if you're not careful, it leads to overloading of a circuit.
