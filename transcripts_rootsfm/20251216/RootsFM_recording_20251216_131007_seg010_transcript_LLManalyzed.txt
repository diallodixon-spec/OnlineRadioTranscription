20251216 131007 The scramble for Africa When men drank our blood like it's been dead wine Put us in misery, it was such a dead time Come on, they ravished our home and flesh Took us to a land of darkness Now we have seen the light, let us all unite And we crave Africa And we develop Africa And liberate Africa Black people stop turning stop turn fool over diamonds, gold and silver Come on, cause we have that abundant in Africa, yeah Stop it to each other, love one another
