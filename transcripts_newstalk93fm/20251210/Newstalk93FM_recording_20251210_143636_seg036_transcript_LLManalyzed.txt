I'm gonna take my time and I'm gonna keep it nice, nice, neat, neat Sugar, sugar, sweet, sweet You make me melt like candy Only you can make it drip that kind of way My baby come in handy When I wanna get away So tell me, what are you on tonight? Cause I wanna take a ride Let me blow your mind Right here from the passenger side It's like that y'all I got the sweet and the spice and everything nice It's like that Y'all I got my hand in the line with the cream on the side Gonna use my expertise. I'ma keep it nice. I'm gonna keep it neat. I might keep it sugar. I might keep this sweet
