2025-12-12 10:07:17 schools that reopened opened and so we've been supporting them. Um additionally, we want to ensure that for those schools that reopened and were not fully resumed that they will be able to do so come January and so the support is ongoing and we are working with our partners. Um one thing I must add as well, we have been getting a lot of support from schools from other regions. You know, I must commend these schools. If I begin to name them, it would take all day. But from region one, region two, regions six, seven, they have been pouring out the support, visiting the schools, helping with the cleaning up and also the provision of care packages. Because, you know, you can't have too many care packages. And so, you you know the other regions have been so supportive because regions three four and five would have been the the regions that would have been you know severely impacted by the hurricane so I really want to thank all for all the support that we have been getting excellent so
