2025-12-11 15:56:25 Remember the songs used to make you rock away Those were the days when love used to reign We danced all night till the songs they played We can't come again, do we just the same? Now I feel it in my heart We in such a golden time at the parties Now there's hardly any safe place left to go Someone's bound to come and try to spoil the show Remember the songs that used to make you rock away Those were the days
