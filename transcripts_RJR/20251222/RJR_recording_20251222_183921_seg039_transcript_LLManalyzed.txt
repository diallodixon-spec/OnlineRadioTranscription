20251222 183921 took me an hour and a half or maybe two hours to get to my sister. Usually that's a half an hour drive. And I had to park about three kilometers out and then walk to her house. I just couldn't imagine how my sister was feeling and you know, talking to her and I, and I invited her to come back to Kingston with me and she said, no way I'm staying, staying here. I have to, I can't leave here to come to Kingston to sit down so you know just her show of strength all of that went into writing the song been a hero in the eye of the storm no light no water no food no road no roof over your head yet you're standing bold so many times we fall but we shall rise we shall rise
