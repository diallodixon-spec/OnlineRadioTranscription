============================================================

valve in the deep vein in the leg arising from a previous DVT? Yes. Well, I shouldn't say yes like that. Usually what is said medically is that once you damage your veins, your veins are damaged in terms of the valves. And then if the valves are no longer viable, then maybe some kind of a stent or something else might be needed. I'm not sure, it's definitely out of my field. So I would love for somebody who, maybe an internist or a cardiovascular surgeon or cardiac surgeon or cardiologist or somebody in that area. Maybe our partner's intervention group could assist. Maybe somebody listening now can give us a call and give us a little update on that.
