But they don't understand. If everybody is doing the same thing that is wrong, who will, who will get any energy across the board so that nature smile upon us? Because all that everybody's doing and everybody's doing you know if nature decide to get up and roar the whole place sink well you know see what's going on watch the elements watch the hurricane watch the earthquake watch the storms watch these things observe yeah but guess what when we pray and put out our favours out there in the atmosphere, don't think nature don't accept it and react to it. Oh yes, oh yes, so true Keke. Because words sound carry power and if you get up every day and speak negative, you get negative.
