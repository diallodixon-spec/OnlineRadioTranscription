We are proving that tourism is not just an industry, it is a community, a family, and a force for resilience. A final Jamaica Tourism Cares report will be completed and presented by December 31, 2025. But today, it's not about closing the book, it's about turning the pages. For the tourism workers of Jamaica, we see you, we value you, and we will stand with you as you rebuild. To our partners, thank you for proving that when Jamaica calls, the world answers. And to the people of Jamaica, this is our commitment.
