20251215 121914 Said I'm falling, falling, I'm falling As I lay my bed with my head to the ceiling Say I'm drowning alone and I'm lost in my feelings Somebody send me a sign cause you know that I need it Can't take away all of my anxiety. Anxiety, my remedy. I tell you that we all need love. Drop a punch on me, love. Way to punch on me love. Together, we all need love, drop a punch on me love, way to punch on me.
