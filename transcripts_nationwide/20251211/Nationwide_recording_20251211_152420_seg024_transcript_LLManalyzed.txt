outreach activities with members of their team that have been affected and who reside in the affected areas. So we would love to see many of our ministries, departments and agencies continuing the work that many are doing in terms of doing outreach in the affected areas In terms of the private sector, we're definitely encouraging the private sector to continue doing what they are doing. We've had reports of many hotels saying that, you know, they're seeing cancellations from private sector entities. We really do need to kind of make up for what is happening in the West in terms of the downturn in economic activity. So those of us in areas that haven't been affected as much, please go out, spend money. The economy needs it. But at the same time, please spend time doing outreach in the affected areas. I mean, absolutely. I agree. Yeah, indeed. Indeed. We talk about the morale.
