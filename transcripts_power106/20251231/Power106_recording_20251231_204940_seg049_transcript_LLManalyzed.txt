20251231 204940 Hold on, hold on, hold on My first must it was I wanted too much time I had to have you morning, noon or night If I would have known then The things that I know now I might not have lost the time I complain about. Don't waste your time fighting life by the cause of despair. Hold on to your love. You've got to hold on. Hold on to your love You've got to hold on Hold on to your lover The heart I'm banging now It's not the heart you break It's the love you give
