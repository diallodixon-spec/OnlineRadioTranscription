If you feel the need to keep your life in tune, because you're tired of the dirge every day, just turn yourself the trumpet of God Almighty While the others just wander around I'm a member of the Holy Ghost travel band We're moving on up to a better land And we hear the voice of a stupid mad, singin' like Hollywood's a-goin' there! We hear the trumpet of joy, singin' to the trumpet of tears!
