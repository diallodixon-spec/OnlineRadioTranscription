20251222 145652 If an elderly family member gets married without any one of his relatives knowing, can the the marriage annulled simply on the basis of the relatives not knowing, not being notified, not being witnesses, then that's not enough. There is no law, no rule that says you have to notify a relative when you're getting married, elderly or not. You know, that's why some people elope. You know, lots of people get married and don't tell a soul. They don't have to. You can't get your marriage invalidated or annulled because of that.
