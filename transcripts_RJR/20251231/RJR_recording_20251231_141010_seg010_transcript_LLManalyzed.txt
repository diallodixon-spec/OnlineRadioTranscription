20251231 141010 It's five o'clock in the morning I'm just kidding I knock on the door, a voice sweet and low says She opened up the door and let me in. Never once did she say, where have you been? She said, are you hungry, honey? Did you eat yet? Let me hang up your coat. The woman tells me, pass me your hat. All the time she's smiling. Never raise a good voice.
