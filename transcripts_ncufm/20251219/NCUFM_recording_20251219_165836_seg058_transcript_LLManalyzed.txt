20251219 165836 If you're on your way home, I pray you get there safe. If you're already home, blessed be the name of the Lord, you'll reach home safe. I want you to have a wonderful dinner. I'm gonna go look about mine. Oh yes, drive time, family. It's time to pull up the handbrake. Coming up next, we have the Adventist Church News, the Church Bulletin Board and the Sunset Serenade with Lincoln and Lizeth Martin. Until Monday for The Driver 2OCLOCK, I'm Matthew J. Wright. I'm over and out. Happy Sabbath when it comes. Blessings. Blessings. B-E-E. Oh, we go again. B-L-E-S-S-I-N-G and another S to you. I'll see you Monday.
