You can call me, I'd love to hear from you. Last week we had a very informative discussion about pre-diabetes and diabetes with Dr. Patrice Francis-Eman, and she's a consultant internal medicine physician endocrinologist at the University Hospital of the West Indies. So if you missed that discussion, you can listen to it on the Power 106 FM app. So we continue with our discussion of diabetes in today's opening segment. So let's look at testing for diabetes and hopefully we'll have the time to speak about high and low blood sugar levels. Now, diabetics need to know all they can about diabetes.
