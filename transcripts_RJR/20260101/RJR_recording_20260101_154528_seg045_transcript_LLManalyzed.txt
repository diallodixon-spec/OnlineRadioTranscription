I don't want to tell someone, I want to pick up all the musicians like Roblin and some people I might not call, but everybody who is there for kind of help in developing things and things like that. And the producer of them and the singer of them, because I want to tell you, when I play, I let them jump out and everyone wants to see them and like it. That would be it. I'm going to listen to the band and say thank you for the awesome. You have to pick up the musicians, because they're going to know me for the experiments and things like that. You've got to pick up people like the channel one, like Chris Blackwell, and a lot of people who kind of give me, Joe Gibbs, all the producers, they kind of give me.
