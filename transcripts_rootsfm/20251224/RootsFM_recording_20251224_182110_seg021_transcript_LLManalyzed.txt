20251224 182110 This Christmas Each time I remember the day you went away And how I would listen to the things you have to say I just break down as I look around the only thing I see All is emptiness and loneliness and an unlit Christmas tree it will be lonely this Christmas without you to hold lonely this Christmas lonely and cold it will be cold, so cold Without you to hold this Christmas You remember last year, darling
