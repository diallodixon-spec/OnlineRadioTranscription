2025-12-12 12:53:23 information provided by the Planning Institute of Jamaica and the Minister of Finance, the fiscal impact is estimated at 5.3% of GDP over financial year 2025-26 to the financial year 2029-30, well above the legislative threshold of 1.5% to trigger suspension of the fiscal rules. He adds that the information provided by the PIOJ and the Finance Ministry was not as comprehensive as desired, given that damage assessments are still underway. Preliminary assessments conducted by the World Bank in collaboration with the Inter-American Development Bank estimate physical damage from the hurricane at U.S. $8.8 billion, equivalent to approximately 40 percent of the country's gross domestic product. The Jamaica Civil Service Association, JCSA, is raising concerns about the government's decision to cancel all Christmas parties for public sector entities this year.
