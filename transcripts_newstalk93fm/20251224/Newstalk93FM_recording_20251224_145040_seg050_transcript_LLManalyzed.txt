20251224 145040 I don't want a life for Christmas. This is all I'm asking for. I just want to see my baby standing right outside my door. I just want you for my own. More than you could ever know. Make my wish come true. Baby, all I want for Christmas is you, baby. All I want for what's right with you. Baby, all I love is what's good with you, baby. All I want, what's good now with you.
