20251224 173917 Every other genre. They just come, run the place a little bit and then they just phase out. Reggae music never phase out. Yet. Never ever ever ever. You know why? Because it stays authentic. It doesn't change. If it's not broken, why fix it? It's been working for so many years, so... Yeah man, preserve it the same way. Don't make nobody talk about say I'm gonna add this to reggae music and change this more reggae music, I'm mad. Go inside with that man. Call it something else, nobody call it reggae music. You see it? Yes I am. Nothing wrong with if you wanna do reggae music, but if you're gonna add something to it., call it something else. See? Yeah. Shout out to the peeps over there at Printbaker. They're the ones fully, fully endorsing today. And today is all about priority deal.
