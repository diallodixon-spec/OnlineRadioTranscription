============================================================

Self-reliance, your greatest defense You have to know when fit there down some fence Laugh it off and walk it off Don't let them know we stand tall in your thoughts Making boundaries I'm making boundaries Walls so thick that you won't climb Lying so long that you can't find my heart Will never be something for anyone to trample on again Gotta protect me to the end No, no, no No, no, no. No, no, never again. No, oh, no, no, oh. No, never again.
