============================================================

Like I can't describe what's going on It's just I feel I'm not alive when you're not home I don't wanna sleep I don't wanna be I just want you here beside me Without you no hope Why does Monday Come back on Tuesday? Why does summer start in June? Why do winters come too soon? Why do people fall in love? When they're always breaking up? Oh why? Why do we love in me? Why the spring rain?
