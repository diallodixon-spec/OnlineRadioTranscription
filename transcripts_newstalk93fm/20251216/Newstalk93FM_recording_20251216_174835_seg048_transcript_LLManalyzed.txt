20251216 174835 I know my life will never be the same You made your choice and I will not complain Don't raise your voice Please don't speak my name Just say goodbye It's too late to lie I've been in love already so I re-learned. But I couldn't help imagine it could get any worse. Realizing I don't know you is just real absurd. I really got to say you got away with words. All those moments we shared, you'd bury me, you saw. Behind a perfect smile were just lies that you told. Said you'd always be there. I believed you for sure. But I watched you disappear when I needed you most. My life will never be the same. You made your choice and I will not complain. Don't raise your voice.
