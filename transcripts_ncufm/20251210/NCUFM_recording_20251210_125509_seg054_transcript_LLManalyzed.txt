We love cruisers, we have come to the end of another cruise. We have dropped anchor, and it is time to disarm. Drop anchor now. Disperse. Your life is like a current. And whenever the rough seas look clear, do not forget that the rough sea is right there in the boat without you taking so much rubber in the boat.
