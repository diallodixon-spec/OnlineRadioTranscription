20251229 170002 Thank you, Salah. This one says good afternoon, Jesse. This is Churchman. Could you tell the caller from Portmore to keep the soil wet because cats don't like wet soil? Richard again, Jesse from where I'm standing. TT seems to be deeply invested in politics, but personally, I think he's grappling with a bit of depression. Okay. Don't know about that. Finally, Jesse, the JLP apologist. Richard realized that the PMP is a private organization that shouldn't and can't be held at the same standards as the government. So he's calling for all the private citizens to account for all the funds they may have collected for hurricane relief. What nonsense is he talking? That's from Metro. Gotta go. Thanks to everyone who called. Thanks to all our messengers. A big thanks to you for listening and thank you so much to the great Shaq himself Adrian Reed. Thanks as well. The news is next. Have a wonderful afternoon. You're listening to Power 106 FM. The time is now 5 o'clock. News comprehensive, powerful, powerful and credible. Power 106 FM now presents a sample
