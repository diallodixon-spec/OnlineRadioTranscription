20260102 210805 Good morning to the dance Liqueur Blanc and one Love and unity, who don't have in the dance Shake a hand and just dance Because we love who don't dance on the dance floor Black people for more Come make whiskey and, till sweat run, till we blood run cold Let me tell you now, make me skank and move up on the dance floor. I know you think, remember me say way back a long time, when downtown business wasn't so fine. Gunshot bust in.
