20251230 134020 you always catch me when I fall when the tour bus drop off and all light lock off and I'm a mere mortal again The mortal they live full and all the fans gone home I'm glad that you're more than a friend When you love his life, Jameson And I wouldn't give a shit without you darling You're talking about Ruth FM 9 to 6.1 You always gets me when I fall These people just like you and you don't pass them in the traffic They never fall in love and some of them say they're lucky None of them are fortunate enough to have somebody Some just cannot see beyond the flesh and it's so funny Never get too caught up in yourself to feel the magic
