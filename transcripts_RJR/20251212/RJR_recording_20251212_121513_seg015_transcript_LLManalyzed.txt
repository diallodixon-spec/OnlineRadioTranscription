2025-12-12 13:06:05 in their second innings this in the post-lunch session. Kevin Hodgetop scored with 38, while Justin Greaves made 25, and Jamaica's Brandon King at 22. Jacob Duffy was the pick of the Kiwi Bowlers with 5 for 38. Michael Ray supported with 3 for 45. Now set 56 to win, New Zealand coasted to 57 for 1 to wrap up victory before Tee and take an unbeatable 1-0 lead in the three-match series. Devin Conway made an unbeaten 28 while getting some starts but we didn't really convert into anything big so we thought that we left some runs out there in the first inning and we thought that we would have gotten those runs in the second innings but it didn't happen so very disappointing for us after the bowling
