Yeah. So what do you say to the person who feels like, oh my gosh, I should have done this soon. I've wasted a whole 11 months and a couple of days. I want to be too late. Perfect. That's a, that's a perfect question. Remember what I said to you earlier when I sat Friday, not even sat a lie down on the bed, so stressed, tired, depressed, you know, mourning the loss, everything, something kicked in my brain and it said it clicked. Redeemed the time. Let me tell you something about time. Chronos is a time right now. If we look on the watch, it's something to four right now. That's the current time. Kairos is a defining moment in your life. Defining moment in your life, not waiting on the calendar. It's not waiting on a Friday or a Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday. The Kairos moment can come at any time. Who to tell if your Kairos moment won't come within the next three weeks?
