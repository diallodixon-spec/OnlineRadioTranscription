20251223 144422 I won't ask for much this Christmas I won't even wish for snow And I, I'm just gonna keep on waiting Underneath the mistletoe I won't make a list and send it To the North Pole for sailing I won't even stay awake to hear the magic rain deadly. Cause I just want you here tonight. Holding on to me so tight. What more can I do? Baby, all I want for Christmas is you. You, baby. All the lights are shining so brightly everywhere. And the sound of children's laughter fills the air.
