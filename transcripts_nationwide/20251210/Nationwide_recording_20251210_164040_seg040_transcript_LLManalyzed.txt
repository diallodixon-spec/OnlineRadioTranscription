Baby, take a pic and post it on your phone Hey, you're friends trying hard You're pretty from the grandma, you're pretty in a real life Everybody loves boots, that's why you stick with it You think you're number one, you will not stick with it You ain't never sell a light, all your skin just a throwback, step a light stick to stick Smile show you're pretty, dimple your teeth white, you're not fit with your name brand
