20251216 122020 take on New Zealand in the third and final test at the Bay Oval beginning on Wednesday as they look to square the series. Opener Taj Narain-Chandepal has been ruled out as he continues to recover from a side strain sustained ahead of the second test. The left-hander who played a vital role in the opening match with a well-crafted half century has not fully recovered in time for the series decider dealing a blow to the Caribbean batting lineup. In another setback, the team will be without performance analyst Avinash Sitaram who has returned home due to personal family reasons. The host currently leads the three-match series 1-0 after a dominant nine-wicket victory in the second test. As a result, the West Indies must win the final encounter to level the series and avoid a series defeat. With injuries and awful absences adding to their challenges, the Caribbean team will need to dig deep and deliver a strong all-round performance if they are to end the tour on a positive note against a confident New Zealand.
