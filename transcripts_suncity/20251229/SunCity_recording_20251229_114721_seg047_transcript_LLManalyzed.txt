20251229 114721 I heard a little rumor last night Somebody told me you ain't doing me right She wasn't doing me right While I been turning my back you been up playing the field She goes playing the field, playing the field Can you look me in the eyes and say to me it's not real Girl, that could not be real, couldn't be real That's all I wanted to know That look is giving you away And I never believe in a single word you say I never believe in that You're living danger. Woman, you're living too dangerously for me. You're living dangerously. Is it me, I've a rent on you, baby? You're leaving dangerously. Can you live it too dangerous for me? Don't worry.
