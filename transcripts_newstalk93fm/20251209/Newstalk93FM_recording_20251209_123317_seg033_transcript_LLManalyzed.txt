I wanna give you nobody, no sympathy I take away the pain, I give you everything I just wanna see, wanna see If this world remains I can't lie, I trust you, I love you I won't waste your time, I turn it off Just so I can turn you on I'ma make you say love I'm not even trippin', I won't stretch you out I might even settle down for you I'ma show you I'm a pro I'ma take my time and turn it off Just so I can turn you on, baby If this world were mad
