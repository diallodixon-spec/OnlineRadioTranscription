For those who have eyes that see me acting up and whining. Loose, all down on the ground, walking, walking on me. But it's dragging, dragging all over tongue and they say I lose it. I never meant to be the same, deep up and all inside of me. When I come on the stage, getting all bad, you know I lose it, I ain't never meant to be the same Deep heart and all inside of me When I come on the stage, get in a bag, you know I lose it When I drop it hot and I whine it On top the speaker box and I grind it And I don't want to stop and they call me lose it But I looser than, loose it I'm sweeter than, she said This carnival haunt me so damn loose Hey, get looser where you, get lo loose away Get loose away, loosen your waist, kill the wits you hate Now show me your slackness, show me your wit and practice Lucy is a carnivalist, and that's why I behave so loose Oh, don't mind me, girl
