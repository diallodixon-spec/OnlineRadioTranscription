Mr. Wildman is earning his bread. I have no criticism of Mr. Wildman. None whatsoever. Mr. Wildman, I eat him food. He might earn him money. So don't trouble him. Talk about the man who is paying him. I will buy two bags of protein like that down in a centiliter. There you go sir. I will sell that money. Respect Eric. Thank you. Go again Kevin. Who's next? Marie. Good morning Marie. Hi George. How are you doing? I'm very well Marie. Good morning to you.
