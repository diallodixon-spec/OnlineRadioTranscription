about and I and I hardly a day can pass without me actually, you know, seeing someone or however they're treating someone I find receive people. Trust me, any doctor who sees me will be nicer to the patient to come there after. Because I'm like, no, when I go out, I say, thank you so much. Have a great day. And guess what? Have a good Christmas when it comes. You know? And thank you. You know what I'm saying? And when I got served my medication, I did likewise. Make sure me always say good morning, good afternoon, how are you? Because it not take nothing out of me and it kind of put me on a bubble to make me feel good. You know, it keep me flowing in a nice life.
