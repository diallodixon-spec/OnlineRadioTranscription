The Buccaneers Club has been around for close to 35 years. And over the years, members are passed on. So the event is to memorialize them. So every year, it's 30 years that we have had this event 30 consecutive years and you know it's it's a fundraiser and early in the game the the buccaneer club buccaneers club decided to um what should i say adopt the law street Trade Training Center as a beneficiary from the proceeds we raised from this event. So, for 30 consecutive years, I've been able to contribute to that institution.
