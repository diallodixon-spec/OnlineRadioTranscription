We got up yesterday I'd like to let you know He is still the God today More than anything He hangs He hangs He hangs We need Jesus What a joy that He brings We need Jesus Much more than anything We need Jesus Salvation to impart We need Jesus In our hearts There's joy for all of us who trust in his grace If you keep your hands in his, he'll put your life in place
