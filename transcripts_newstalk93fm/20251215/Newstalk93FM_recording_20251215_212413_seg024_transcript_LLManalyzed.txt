20251215 212413 So if I took it for granted You're not promised from today I go drunk like I never drunk Wait like I never went blind Like I never went before Just to show you I saw it, I saw it And I need you back in my life You got people by the truck Emotions running high We underpin this tie Tears running down we eye Can't you tell that we saw it, we saw it And we need you back and we lie. I need back, I'm back home. Come to me, come to me, come on to me. I, I need time, not place to go. I need the world. Come to me. Come on to me, come on to me Come on to me First time I touch this stage This make me feel alive
