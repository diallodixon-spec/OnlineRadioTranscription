you say I got to go cause I know Dirty heart can sweep it through They are like the trees, they can't feel nothing, they can't show it And I know, Dirty heart can wash it through But there is no bad sign and to do it Attention slowly, take away, take away And anything we not clean and pure, we a country man Smile up in your face, and take this grace We know them are dirty See my friends turn enemy No one near them will know I ask me far No length, no bar, no length, no bar
