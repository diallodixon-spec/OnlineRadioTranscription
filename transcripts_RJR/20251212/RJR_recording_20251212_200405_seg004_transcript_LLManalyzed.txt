20251212 200405 Take me to the river Take me to the sea Wash over me music Bed me in your melody We are such a blessed tribe Sweeter than a million bees. People live a thousand lives and never feel this free. A million people coming down, dancing to our song. Love is life and life is love. Blessings from above. Can you feel the love that's in the air? Well, if you feel it, then we'll hear you say. Dancing, moving, moving everywhere. If you feel it then we hear you say.
