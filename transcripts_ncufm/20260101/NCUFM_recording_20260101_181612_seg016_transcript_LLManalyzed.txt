20260101 181612 but lost instead because of me I made a decision that my life is gonna be about God I may not be famous cause I wanna sing a righteous song don't worry about me my problems won't be money it's better to please God than having everyone bowing at my feet So I'm going down on my knees I'm begging you to help me Cause I am nobody When you're in my life I feel free on my knees I'm begging you to help me Cause I am nobody When you're in my life I feel free I feel free
