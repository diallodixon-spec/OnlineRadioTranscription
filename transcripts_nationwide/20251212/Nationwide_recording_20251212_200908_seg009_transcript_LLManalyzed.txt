Right, so data communication is the sending and receiving of messages from over a network. So the internet, which is the biggest network that we have, it's network on top of network. So it's over a network and it's also the correct interpretation of the messages as well. So the emailing, that's a form of data communication. We use a protocol, which is a rule called VOIP, which I'm using now for voice. So voice over internet protocol. That's also a form of data communication, sending WhatsApp messages to your friend. That's a form of communication as well. Yes. And data communication is enabled both wireless and wireless, wired and wirelessly. Right.
