There are still waters He restored my soul He restored my soul Splashing, dashing, restless sea Never still you seem to be Sometimes angry, sometimes sad Sometimes the lovers, though you're glad Splashing dashing restless sea Never still, you seem to be Sometimes angry, sometimes sad Sometimes the love is all your blood Little children love you well Of all the wondrous tales you tell Love to watch you come and go In the times the heavens blow Yet no I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will spare no evil, cause justice is with me Thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me Splashing dashes of blood
