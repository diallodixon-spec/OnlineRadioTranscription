A five-minute feature on local news, ideas, people, places and things. Roundabout JA. Melissa has come and gone, and every cow that was roaming freely roundabout JA is about to see their free paper go up in flames. Guess which parish has a cattle-tagging blitz? Well on the way by now. I'm Joy Kelly. Let's go. Roundabout, your pregnancy and your mother own a two different something. You'll climb up in her age and also your high risk for sugar, high blood pressure and other things that can affect you and your baby even before her time for the clothes, pampers and crib. You try your best to go to a clinic early and go get your check up, you hear me Diana? Once a baby business, clinic is a must and a healthy body.
