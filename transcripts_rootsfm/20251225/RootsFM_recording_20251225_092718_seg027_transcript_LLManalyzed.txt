Oh baby, all I want for Christmas is you. Ooh, baby. All the lights are shining so brightly everywhere. And I saw the children laugh and feel the air. And everyone is singing. I hear those letters ringing. Santa, won't you bring me the one I really need? Won't you bring me, baby, to me? Oh, I don't want a life for Christmas.
