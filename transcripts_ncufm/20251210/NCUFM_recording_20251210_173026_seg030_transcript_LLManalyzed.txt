Here and far He gave you a smile and a happy little face The light of the world, starting in this place Little children, little children, come and clap your hands Little children, Little children, come and stand your feet Come children to love and play and sing Let the children give praises to your King All right, you do it just fine Clapping your hands and clapping your feet This is praise time He made you a jewel He made you a star To show his praises both near and far He gave you a smile and a happy little face The light of the world starting in the night
