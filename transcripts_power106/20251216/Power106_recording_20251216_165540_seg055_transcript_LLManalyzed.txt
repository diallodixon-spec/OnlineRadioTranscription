We have to utilize technology and the technocrats, as you say, in terms of doing predictive models to say this is likely outcome. We need to put in a runoff here or there to handle water overflow and all of that, we have to get to that point. We have to be more sophisticated in our approach. And that's more so from a government standpoint. We're not seeing that level of sophistication taking place. And we need that now. Indeed, we do. Steve, we're almost on the news, my brother.
