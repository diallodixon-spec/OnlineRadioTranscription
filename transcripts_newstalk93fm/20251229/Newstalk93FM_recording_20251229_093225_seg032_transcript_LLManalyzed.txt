20251229 093225 I only need your house address. If you wanna pull up on my tape cassette. I put it wider than the internet. I'm a presidential liberal, so fail to look. I need you now, now. Put me on fire like a lantern. Can you taste what is over here? And I wonder why you so, so, so. What did I do for you, girl? Can I do for you? And I know it, I know it, and I know I can do for you. Love like a riddle, yeah. Givin' me the clues like a riddle. Life's a little, yeah. Life's pretty sweet, can't be better.
