20251231 212118 Wait a second when I saw you I went to Toronto then I went to Japan no already started No when I came to visit you in the E-Zone I was going to Toronto first of all I forgot I went to Toronto first then Japan then New York So you're busy? Yeah, it was busy. It's just you know, we're just working. It was busy. Yeah, I love that for you though. Yes. I think I find that the best way to connect with people is by being with them. Yes. And performing and letting them hear me, feel my voice, feel my energy and stuff like that. So, um, as many times as I can find myself wherever I need to be, you know, outside of like the big, big bookings, like, you know, you have the big stages and stuff, but I've found that found that I've built my community through things like going to places and setting up my own shows and just having them. I don't like to ask people what's their favorite song on the album because obviously it's like having 10 and 11 children and then it's like oh my god who's your favorite child?
