20251215 102221 in terms of murders in Jamaica. Last time. Since we are now about to hit fewer than 700 murders. The last time we had fewer than 700 murders in Jamaica was 1994. That's how many years ago? 31 years ago. We murdered 690 people in Jamaica. So for the last 30, 31 years, we have not seen what we are now seeing in 2024. And therein lies the story this morning. 690, we haven't seen that figure for a long time. So, think about that. Yeah. Think about that. But the commissioner is not being complacent.
