You gotta live to save your life After the sunset comes the darkness of the night Better open up your eyes I just go with the trade wind blows Sendin' love to my friends and foes And I suppose I'm pleased To be chillin' in the West Indies To provide all my wants and needs I got the sunshine, rivers and trees Relieved When I see you, I see your way Just stick all this trade from hypocrisy I say Every man to them own a philosophy I live the proper way
