20251215 114833 There's no winter time There's a sweet sunshine At Christmas Jamaican style Lots of green in mid-December Fragrant flowers, sweetly blue A true Jamaican Christmas greeting I extend to you Just come on over, there is room Jogging, shopping or just dancing On the beach or checking out a show In Jamaica it is fine to go fishing all the time It's lots more fun than fishing in the snow In the West, in the West it is Every Christmas is a time for all to smile
