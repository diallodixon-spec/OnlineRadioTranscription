Well I pop to Belgium, I make a slide, I take a walk, go out the street But while I waitin' down the road, people on my right I feel a gripe and I start to feel very weak Before too long, you know how they ask I run the daily like a judge made pay Everybody in the road a dead with laugh. It's better know that crime will never pay. Rambo's liver put the neck mannish water. Billy Goat's feet make the air ring for your daughter. Going for the lunch put the bite in your mouth. It make your daughter. It make you daughter.
