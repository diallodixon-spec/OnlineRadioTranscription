20251222 110204 I'll leave Christmas this year Rockin' around the Christmas tree at the Christmas party hop. Mistletoe hung where you can't see every couple tries to stop. Rocking around the Christmas tree let the Christmas spirit ring. Later we'll have some pumpkin pie and we'll do some caroling. You will get a sentimental feeling when you hear the voices singing. Let's be jolly, let the halls with boughs of party rockin' around.
