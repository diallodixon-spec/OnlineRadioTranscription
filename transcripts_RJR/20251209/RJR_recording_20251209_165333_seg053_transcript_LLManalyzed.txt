============================================================

They don't understand us like we do. I need you near me night and day. Together there ain't nothing we can't do. Scoop me up and we can go. To that little spot where no one knows. Spend a little time just us alone. You can caress my body. Never let go. Oh You and me, you and me, as I can be, I'll be your teacher, my baby. Don't wanna love, ain't gonna be another, can't nobody do what you do to me. Nobody. Can't nobody love me.
