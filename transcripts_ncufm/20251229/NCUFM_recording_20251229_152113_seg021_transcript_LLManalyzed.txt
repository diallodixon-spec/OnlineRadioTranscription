20251229 152113 You kept all your promises That you gave to me The day you set me free Jesus, you're the only way by salvation. Wherever I go, I feel safe, cause you walk by my side. I will thank you, I will thank you for your loving hand. Jesus my shepherd, you kept all your promises that you gave to me.
