20260101 160103 Big Big Tune by the group called The Bee Gees. Just me. Wonderful vocal arrangement. Combination between the voices. So amazing. That's the reason why I prefer this version over the Destiny's Child's version. It's good, you know. Their version is also good, you know, but I prefer this one the most. All right. All right, peeps.
