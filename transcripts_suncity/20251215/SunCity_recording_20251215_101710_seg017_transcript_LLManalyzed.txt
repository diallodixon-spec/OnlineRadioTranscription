20251215 101710 and that's my team, but you can say you're over it, but that's the situation we're in. That's where we are right now. And I know that people, but you know, where are we getting this perception from and where we did this, we didn't just make this up. It's because we know through the years how things got. And also a lot of people are saying the same thing. Where is the money? Where is the aid? Where did you spend it? And then now you're coming and saying, oh, actually, we spent 200, 225 million. So yeah, and for me, it's about Jamaican people. I don't care about no colors. And a lot of people are politicizing this thing. It's about helping the people that I've seen that is hungry and don't have nothing, lost everything. So that's why I feel so passionate about it it and that's why we have to speak out because I think because people are talking and that's why they're giving us these numbers now and having to explain but some boy I smell a rat that's all I'm saying I smell a rat but yes okay
