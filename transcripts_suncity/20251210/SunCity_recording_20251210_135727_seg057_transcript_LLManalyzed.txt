I wish to see the life journey done Vineyard of flourish, them gassy and burned it down Smuggled soft, them dead light but they push us for perfect gun Earthy legalize Burn down me legalize I don't want to see good faith destroyed I can see the wickedness within their evil eyes Thingy heart so make them space up and love space up Why them terrorize the youths at night and taste up? Why make them love the SLR and AK? So why them love kill and put gun for the youths them waste up? They don't know how hungry they feel They want to be stopped by a shiver and eye-winding The parents die at the end Like a shine squeal at the tiling yard In the factories and the train wheel Herbic healing from them Till no one will be forever war The eyes never pure and ever sure In form of telling cops a bungo got Herb in a keg of pure No, it is the same thing them terror ever do her Oh, Herbie, lead the light Burn those mist, lead the light
