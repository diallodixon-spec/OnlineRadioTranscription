2025-12-12 16:13:17 Because I'm happy I belong if you feel like that's what you want to do Here come bad news, don't be missing that Give me all you got and don't hold it back I stay out too late Got nothing in my brain That's what people say That's what people said I go on too many dates But I can't make them stay At least that's what people say But I keep cruisin' Can't stop, won't stop movin' It's like I got this music in my mind saying it's gonna be alright Cause the players gonna play play play play play And my haters gonna hate hate hate hate hate baby I'm just gonna shake shake shake shake shake
