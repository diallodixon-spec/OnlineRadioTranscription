20251225 213220 When it's Christmas time, I'm all smiles. When everybody's counting down, grand markets in the town, we're buying presents. For those who can't afford it. The Christmas breeze, it lifts my vibe. The joyous energy it brings when mommies starts to sing. Bread fruits roasting on an open fire. Auntie's cooking in the kitchen. Stringing a pebble light. Morning to morning light. Singing carols all the time. But I don't mind. Yeah. Shout it out on top of your lungs.'s christmas christmas time it's christmas Christmas time it's Christmas Christmas time yeah yeah yeah
