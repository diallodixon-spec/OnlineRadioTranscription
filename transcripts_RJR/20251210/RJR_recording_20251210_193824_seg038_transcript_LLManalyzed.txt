a grant of up to $500,000 that the NHG is offering grant, meaning you don't have to pay that back. And that's for contributors, again, or mortgages, of course, or pensioners. We are also considering them at this particular time, and that they too need support. And even if you are a contributor, you stop paying, the NHG is also looking at an accelerated program where you can get up to date with those contributions and also benefit. Right. And so for persons who are perhaps just tuning into this segment of the program, we're going to go through them, you know, just item by item. So give some additional information in terms of the hurricane relief loan, who qualifies and who receives it. And the cap is 3.5 million dollars. And what can they use it for? Definitely. So I'll start with that last question first. So that 3.5 million can be used to make repairs to the property.
