But life will be without you, can't begin to imagine All if you make me doubt you, me just feel me, I gon' love you the same way Let's get married, done with the play dates Next ten years, two are with the same place Nah, I sell you out, disciple of no exchange Respect you to the fullest, I gon' make you feel no way My heart I yearn, but you already know that Fight for you like the Navy, I'm your little soldier You gave me everything, my one boy, you went back, come make a fall in love again Baby it is obvious, that I'm in love with you Girl, heart's been racing, I've been waiting just to see you Baby it is obvious That I'm in love you, girl Heart's been racing I've been waiting, just to see you, I'm off the exodus Young captain in charge, I'm off to catch a bus Tell me if you let it go You have my mind on me yard, me half a mechanical I close my eyes so I can see you in the darkness Would you love me still baby girl regardless Third eye open so I can see all the darkness
