People who feel strongly about these things should call their members of Parliament and tell their members of Parliament you want these things debated in the Parliament. Because a lot of times something is raised in the Parliament and quickly people in the print media come out, you see stories in the print media, you see editorials being written and then a few voices and it just dies down. Lawmakers should not be afraid of those voices. If you think this is a serious problem, you should tell your member of parliament to table a private member's motion because you want a debate on whether that kind of speech should be criminalized and whether it can be criminalized and what are the boundaries of that criminalization.

I know. I know.
