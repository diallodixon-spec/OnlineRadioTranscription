20251222 130203 Underneath the mistletoe I will take the list and send it To the North Pole for singing I won't even stay awake to Hear the magic rain declare Cause I just want you here tonight Holding on to me so tight What more can I? Oh, baby, all I want for Christmas is you. Ooh, baby. Oh, the lights are shining so brightly every morning. And I saw the children laugh and feel the air. And everyone is singing. I hear those lovers singing. Santa, won't you bring me the one I really need? Won't you please bring my baby to me?
