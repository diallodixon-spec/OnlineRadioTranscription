20251219 135443 Just come along for the ride Oh, my outfit's so tight You can see my heartbeat tonight I can take the heat, baby, best believe That's the moment I shine Cause every romance shakes and it bends Don't give a damn When the night's here, I don't do tears Baby, no chance I could dance, I could dance I could dance Watch Dance, dance the night away My heart could be burning but you won't see it on my face Watch me Dance, Dance the night away I still keep the party running, I wonder What y'all trying to do? 24 karat magic in the air Hits the tone so clear Pop pop it's show time
