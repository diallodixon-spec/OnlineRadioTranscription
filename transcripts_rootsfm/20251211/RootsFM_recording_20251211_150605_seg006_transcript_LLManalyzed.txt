So we go out there and just do what we have to do. And we sing and feel good. And besides, I'm going to try. And I really appreciate it up till this day. I can't believe. Yeah, definitely. But tell us why, though. Why music? I always love music, you know. If it's a wedding, you can call me. I've done a few weddings before, even this. I've done funeral as well. I do parties. I do a lot of stuff before even the karaoke. You know, and I said, you know, I'm going to try something else, something different and something fresh, you know. And first time in the studio, I'm not lying. I think he just go in and go sing and go home, but I'm not saying go. A lot of work. Yeah. Because you gotta get it right. Yeah. You get what I'm saying. Yeah, but I won't persuade, man. I'm not lying, I'm not forgetting, man. The first time I go in the studio, man, I'm singing the song, man, and, you know, I'm serious.
