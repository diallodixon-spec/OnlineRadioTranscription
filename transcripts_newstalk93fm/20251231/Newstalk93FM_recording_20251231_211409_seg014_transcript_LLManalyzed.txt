20251231 211409 I just need some solitude, oh gosh. But everybody's trying to talk to me and nobody's trying to hear me out. So you've got some things to say, honestly, you just all move your mouth. The things you say, it makes no sense, I'm in out of time to figure it out. Leave me alone. It's best you just leave me out. See, what I'm trying to say is that this caused me so much pain. Feeling like I've got no control over my own break. When it's sad to see that you don't see, it's driving me insane. Leave me alone now. Oh, yes. Yo, right there Right here now, no for them to get blocked and delete Airplane mode out the life, you're so sweet Come and ring off me line, seven days a the week, oh Me no fi right now, me no fi sleep Leela beg you this, Leela beg you that
