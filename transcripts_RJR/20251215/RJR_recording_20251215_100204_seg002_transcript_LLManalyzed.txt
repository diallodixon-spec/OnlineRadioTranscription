20251215 100204 on Saturday condemns the Trump administration's decision to terminate the family reunification parole programs for families from Haiti and Cuba, as well as from Colombia, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras, stripping them of work authorization. HBA executive director Gareline Joseph told the Caribbean media corporation that the action was not about security, but scare tactics aimed at dismantling lawful family reunification and terrorize black and brown immigrants. Joseph said this latest decision comes on the heels of the administration's move to terminate temporary protected status for Haiti, Ethiopia and other countries, which is another deliberate blow to long-standing immigrant communities in the United States that have contributed significantly economically.
