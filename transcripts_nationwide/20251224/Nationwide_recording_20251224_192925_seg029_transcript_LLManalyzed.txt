I find you guys very, very, very, you're not not reminded, you address issues. I remember talking to a friend and she told me it's pure true, it might be true, but when I listen to the conversation, you learn so much from you guys. George, KPU, all of you guys. Thank you Dawn. Thank you. I'm telling you, I might not be around to hear, but you guys are going to be, it's nationwide, it's going to be the radio station that we need to talk about. I might not live to see it because I'm not young, but I am telling you, you guys have a far way to go.
