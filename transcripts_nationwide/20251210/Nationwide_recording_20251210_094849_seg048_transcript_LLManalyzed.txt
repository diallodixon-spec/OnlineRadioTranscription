it's not new I don't think it's a new thing but I've heard more persons talking about it recently and I just thought that I should use the opportunity to talk about it as well when your card declines from at using a POS machine be careful so if it declines and you know you have money on your card, be careful how you continue to try to run that card. Because apparently there are some types of machines or I don't know what the mechanism is that they have within the machine that is allowing them to take either your card information or gain access in some way to your account. And so I've heard persons saying that they use it at wherever, gas station, shop, wherever.
