20251231 201011 When my time is over, lying in my grave Written on my tombstone, I want it to stay This man was a legend, a legend of his time When he was at a party The party never died Everybody's got a dream So what do you say? Are we making history? May your hearts be full Like your dreams tonight May we sing and dance Till we lose our minds We are only young if we seize the night Tonight, we own the night Tonight we own the night
