20251223 154032 My goal for 2026 is to learn instruments. How difficult is it to learn the band? I would say if you are able to learn a song, you'll be able to learn this instrument. The way to teach you is to start with a song that you like. We just take take them and break it down line by line. And where the notes are and how to roll a note versus striking a note. In music space, of course, what challenges have you had to face in terms of navigating the space as a woman? Because I feel like the fact that you've even started the all-woman movement is in itself a statement about claiming space as a woman in this Caribbean music system. Absolutely. Yeah.
