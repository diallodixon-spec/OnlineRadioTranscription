Day time, night time. Yes, she keeps me loving the right time. Every day I love her just a little bit more. Little bit more, just a little more. Every day, I love her a little bit more, and she loves me the same. Every guy that walks around the street, they say she's sweet. Oh, my baby, can I throw some flowers at your feet? She's young, fresh, and green, green. And I like how she brought up the scene.
