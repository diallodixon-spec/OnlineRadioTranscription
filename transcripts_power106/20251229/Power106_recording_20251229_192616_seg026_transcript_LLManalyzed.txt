20251229 192616 hasn't always worked for them. Some of them have made a mistake going there. And Filipe Colchino, for example, it was a disastrous move from Liverpool to Barcelona. The young talent, Hendrik, went to Real Madrid and he's now going on loan to Lyon because there's no space for him to get a game at Real Madrid. So Estevan, of Chelsea, who I think is the best thing that Brazilian football has produced since Neymar. He has chosen Chelsea and what a start he's made. He's already an absolute hero. I know the Chelsea fans have a song all about him to the tune of KC and the Sunshine Band. Estevan, I like it. I like it too. It's wonderful watching him. He's 18. He scored five goals for Brazil between September and November. It took Vinicius Junior a long, long time to get to five goals for Brazil. Estevan looks like he's been there his entire life. He really is a special talent.
