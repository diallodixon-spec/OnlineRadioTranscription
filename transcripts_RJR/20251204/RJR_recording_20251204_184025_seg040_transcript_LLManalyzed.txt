And there was this one boy, normally don't come to school. He's always disruptive. And that morning, very early, as I walked through the gate, the first person I see is this guy. I said, Lord, why did you let him come today? He's gonna mess up the summit. But I'm telling you, that child sat there, and he was a shining light in that moment, in that class. He was asking questions, he was answering questions. Because the thing is, everything that is there, they can relate to. And I break it down in incremental steps so that it is clear, this is what you're doing, this is the next step. And they were able to relate to it. And that was an excellent class for me. Even though I've encountered so many challenges, I got some good feedback after that evaluation with that group of students. How did you feel seeing how you had managed to help to transform their thinking and their attitudes?
