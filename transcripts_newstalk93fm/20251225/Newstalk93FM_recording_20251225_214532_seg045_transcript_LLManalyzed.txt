20251225 214532 There is just one thing I need Don't care about the present Underneath the Christmas tree I don't need to end my stocking Live upon the fireplace Santa Claus won't make me happy With a toy I don't miss a thing I just want you for my own More than you could ever know Oh Baby, oh, I won't ask for much this Christmas. I won't even wish for snow. I'm just gonna keep on waiting. Oh, I need the mistletoe. I won't make a list and send it to the North Pole for singing.
