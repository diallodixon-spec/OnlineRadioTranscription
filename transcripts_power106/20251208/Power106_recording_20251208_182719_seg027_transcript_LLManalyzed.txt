for them and now we have to go into Nicaragua which is always a challenging environment to say the least so that's where our preparation is now and we turn our focus to you know March 2nd and making sure we get in first and foremost safely and get in in the adequate time to give us the best preparation possible to win that match as well. Is there an opportunity between now and the 2nd of March for the team to assemble? There might be another opportunity for me to go over and check in on some of them with their form. But I think that's a big part as well. Making sure that the players who are coming in, that's a criteria that's selected based on their club form and their health. We have a really good pool of players right now.
