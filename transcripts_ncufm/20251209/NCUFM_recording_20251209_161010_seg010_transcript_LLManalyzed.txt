To give you all the glory To give you all my strength When I'm in my sin You watch it all the way When this life is over I'm gonna put up my wings And I'm gonna tell the story Of how you brought me on To bring me in You've been right there You're thicker than me You don't know That you were there When that snatched me out Of the enemy's hand You. I will bless the lord. You changed my world. I will bless you. You changed my talk. I will bless to change my mind. I will bless save my life. I will bless nobody. I will bless do me like Jesus. I will bless can't nobody
