20251216 094328 don't come as yet from JPS to connect back the wires. Sunday they pass through and go to another area, Panil, and they fix that area, pass through Cedar Mount and they still don't fix it and we are left without it and it's only Cedar Mount and Friendship in this area don't have any electricity. All right, Cedar Mount, out in Browns Hall. I'm not sure, I do know that the JPS has been keeping in touch with us and it's a very delicate bit of work because sometimes it might look very obvious to you as to where the light is going but sometimes you have two or three houses in the same place but one set getting the what the light from one place another set getting it from somewhere else right so I don't know right so it might be more convenient or safer for them to go and restore the light somewhere else but I will ask the people at JPS what is the specific issue
