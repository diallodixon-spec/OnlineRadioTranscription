You know what's everybody love to hear? Yeah! Go! Harder! That's how you be too crystal when you're harder. Now, baby, come in and play cheese. You know about money, make it you with your cheese. No champagne for your friends, then. Sunshine, climb up, make good **** on the fence, then. Boy, you want to drink more. Make sure say later you're planning to ****, baby. Keep up, we have to get up.
