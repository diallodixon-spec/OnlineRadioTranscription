20260102 165240 Hey, hey, hey, hey. Just dance and do what you feel. Everybody, everybody, everybody, everybody. Just do it like a sucker, sucker and deeper. Come up like a rainy day. Do what you feel playing soccer. Man, throw to the jacar, jacar. Team talk, man, you're men. I'm friendly bravado. I'm seen a explosion on the uproar. Just get that, don't let me shoulder clean that. Back away, me back, baby. Why you no lie? Say you mean that. All but me, I don't. Have you ever seen that? D-I-P-G, jump, D-I-N-G. World record, Mr. Martin. World record, world record. World record, D.I.P.G.
