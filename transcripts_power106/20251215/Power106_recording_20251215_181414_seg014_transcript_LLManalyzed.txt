20251215 181414 Yes, but it must have bothered all of us who have had anything at all to do with football coaching. Because we have not seen one of the footballers, you know, Charlie, is having a settled team. And you don't. Because it's a team game and communication is necessary. Communication is very necessary on the pitch. So you can't keep introducing unfamiliar players. And I have not seen a settled level. I have not seen. And then the gameinidad, you brought in a new player after praising Samar Nicholson, then you put Samar on the bench, claiming that you're trying to protect him from yellow cards. Okay, I can understand that. But wouldn't it be better to win the Trinidad game and have it easy at home? hindsight, we're not sure. But I do think that you know we got so many opportunities one behind the other because even the Curacao coach had to leave, they were without the coach playing against us. What better opportunities do we want? Well if we still have another chance and be our nation, we have done miraculous things in the past. Perhaps we have done miraculous ways.
