Why would the government loan the old arm 150 to JPS and still they plan enough employing people from overseas to come and help with the reconstruction of the electricity. I think the Minister of Energy explained that they were going to bring down additional line workers using that 150 million US dollars earlier this week if it was not just yesterday on our program that he explained that to us and as to the additional 250 million as I said I expect that we will get better particulars in the coming days as to what purpose the additional 250 million will serve. I am sure it was not just a random figure just thrown out there by JPS and simply just taken on by the government. I'm sure it serves some purpose.
