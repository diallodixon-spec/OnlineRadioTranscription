20251212 141307 Set me free from my pain Set me free from all of the hurt, all of the shame You're the giver of salvation, you are the giver of light You are the truth, the resurrection and the life So when you see me, when you see me God alone am I source everything We are both sinners God, but not about material things Cause everything on earth will fade away I sing And keep my hallelujah and my praise right here
