sacrificial love. Teach him to serve with gentleness and to guide with godly wisdom. May he reflect your love in every word and action, building a home rooted in grace and truth. Righteous Father God, when trials come, strengthen this man's faith so it does not waver. Remind him that suffering is never wasted. Suffering is used by you to shape endurance and hope. Let him find joy even in hardship, knowing that you are refining his character through every challenge. Help Him not to be anxious about anything, but in every situation, by prayer and petition, present His request to you, O God.
