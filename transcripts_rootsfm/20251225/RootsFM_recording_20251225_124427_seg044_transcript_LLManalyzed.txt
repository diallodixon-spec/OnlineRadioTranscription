20251225 124427 The people of the world are crazy I said the people of the world were mad All because of Fenty They will do anything just to have I heard someone saying the other day That life doesn't make sense living They lost their fate along the way But Jack is always forgiving I don't have to be rich to be a happy man, happy man. Money can't buy you a nice salvation. I don't have be rich to be righteous man. As long as my meditation is free from corruption. Some will sell their soul for vanity just to move up in society All I need is the blessing, prosperity, eternally I've seen many poor men live and I've seen many rich men die
