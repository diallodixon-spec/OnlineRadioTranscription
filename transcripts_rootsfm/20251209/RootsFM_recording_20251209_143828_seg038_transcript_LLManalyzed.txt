I just don't want to call you sweetness. I just don't wanna call you niceness. And how about you get amped when I guess I just don't call you nothing. No, I just don't know. I just want to call you nice. How about you? Then I guess I just want to call you nothingness. How about sugar dumping? And I guess I just don't call you nothing, no. So I wish I had you for myself. No, no, no, no. Hate to share you with even your mama and your dada. Can't help but want you, can't help but need you. Oh, I need you, I need you for myself. Oh, nana, maybe it's because I'm an African Christian. Got to feast my eyes on you.
