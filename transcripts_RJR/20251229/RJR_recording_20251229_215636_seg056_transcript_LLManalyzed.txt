20251229 215636 right after news. Got some shout outs and birthday greetings as well to lay on you. A little more vibe. For folks on the production line as well. And say top of the evening to you. For those on the job. Blessings as well. Doing what you do. Playing your part. We also say hi to those who made it home safely. And for those who are still on route heading home right now. If you're heading to work and you're not late, take your time and get your safe. If you're late, you're late already. Just take your time, get your safe. David Son-born, one called Seduction, talented saxophonist, yeah man.
