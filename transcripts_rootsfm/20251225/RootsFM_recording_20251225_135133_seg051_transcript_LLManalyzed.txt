20251225 135133 I feel like this is coming to an end And it's better for me to let it go now And hold on, it hurts you I gotta let it burn It's coming right for me to say this It's coming from my heart It's been a long time coming But we didn't bend, fell apart We really wanna work this out But I don't think it gonna change I what you do. Think it's best we go our separate ways. I should stay in this relationship. When I'm hurting, baby, I ain't happy, baby. But there's so many other things I gotta do. And I think that you should let it burn. When you're feeling ain't the same in in your body Don't want you to know how to let it go Cause the party ain't jumpin' like it used to If you know this might prove true Let it burn, yeah, let it burn Gotta let it burn
