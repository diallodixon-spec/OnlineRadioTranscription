2025-12-12 14:19:11 I don't wait They don't want me in their proceeding They don't want because I do one way They don't want in their proceeding I ain't don't listen to nothing they say Every breath I drop Jumpin' up Doin' what I want Jumpin' up Tell them I ain't livin' Right, they are sleeping. Every time I drum, doing what I want. Tell them, are you leaving? They don't want me gone. Until my head falls and I'm miserable. All the money grown, I'm was in trouble Look how deep security watch me They don't know I'm out there At this much of a place and a deep threat like a zombie I don't wait They don't want me in their party day
