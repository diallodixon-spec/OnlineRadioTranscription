20251230 150807 community indeed and I'm looking at this picture of you in your rasta colors your Jamaica colors in front of a picture with Bob Marley and one love written on it so you you wear your colors with a lot of pride I can tell you that if you caught me you'll probably see black gold Green. That was back in Canada when it just came out. I went to see the movie. And made sure that you were dressed to suit the occasion. And I want to tell you, I was the only one in the theatre who was dressed like that. But I was the famous one after because every paparazzi wanted to take a photo with me. Of course, because it is very eye-catching. Yes. All right. Well, tell me a little bit about, first of all, the mini Miss Jamaica Heritage Queen pageant. How and why did you decide to pull this together? Thank you very much for asking that question.
