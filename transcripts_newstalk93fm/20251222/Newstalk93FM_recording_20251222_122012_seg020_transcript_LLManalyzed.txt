20251222 122012 I get in both for my hold down. I make your body slow and I slow down. Put it on the low, no go loud down. You know the things I wanna do tonight. Unusual. Put it down, make it take away your peace of mind. You go glow like water, we get it freeze up like, yeah. Open your eyes and look. Look what the hot body can do. I hear the, blue, blue. Focus. Look what the body can do. Body be dancing. Snow white, so my body's so fine. Right punch from the mirror inside. To and I made an inside. Makes sense, oh, makes sense. Hold my color near the distance. Make plans, ready for my distance. Makes sense, so makes sense. Body be look.
