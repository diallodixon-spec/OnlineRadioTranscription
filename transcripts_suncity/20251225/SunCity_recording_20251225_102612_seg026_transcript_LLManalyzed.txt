20251225 102612 People, I have to stop the juggling a while ago. I get a message from Britney. Right? Britney, big up yourself. You hear me? Happy holidays. Merry Christmas, my darling. Right? Britney knows herself, man. And Britney knows why I'm tapping the music, too. So, Britney, happy holidays again. And Merry Christmas, love me I'll come for my liquor dinner a little more right I said I loved you? And where were you when I cried?
