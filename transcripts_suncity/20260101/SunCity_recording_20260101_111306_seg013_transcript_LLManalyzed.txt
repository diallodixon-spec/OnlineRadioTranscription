20260101 111306 I'm so happy, so happy that you're in my life And baby, now that you're a part of me Show me, show me the true meaning of love And I know He loves me I know that He loves me He told me so I know that He loved me Cause His feelings show when He's dancing me You see He cares for me You see how he is so deep in love I know that he loves me cause it's obvious I know that he love me cause it's me he trusts And he's missing me if he's not kissing me
