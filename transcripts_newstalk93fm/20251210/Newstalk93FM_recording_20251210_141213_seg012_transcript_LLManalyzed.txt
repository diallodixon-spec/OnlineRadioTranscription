============================================================

The venue could handle the jammin' But like when the mat will hide We gon' rip it up a spine Good vibes at party, we lovin' Sweet woman, we havin' Greatest on the planet, boy Somebody radio loud playin' a song And it goes enough up And if I lose myself inside this place Well, I show my shit up Empty soca soaker and glass, when the picture's past, the madness ones up. Just give me one more shot inside my glass and watch me level up. Fitting like a hero. Call me hero. oh, oh. Oh, betting like a hero.
