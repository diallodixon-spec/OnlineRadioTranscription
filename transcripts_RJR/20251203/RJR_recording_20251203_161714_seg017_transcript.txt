============================================================

It seems like years Time keeps dragging on and on And forever's been in gone Still I can't figure what went wrong I'd still do anything for you I'd play your care and I don't need you. But you'll never see me crying, you know inside I feel like dying. And I took money here for you. In spite of it all, I've learned so much from you. You made me strong. Don't you ever think that I don't deserve you.
