20251222 214426 Love and us is very special Things you seem to do divine You look straight into my eyes I know what love is meant to be Cause our souls touch differently Love is life and life is living It's very special In my heart there was you holding Love is life where dreams come true And even though I can't have you, baby Desires like these are true for you I hold my hand and take my life Through these days of ventures Once my love was true
