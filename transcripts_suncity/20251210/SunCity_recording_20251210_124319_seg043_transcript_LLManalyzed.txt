Oh, why was the reggae legend so great? Justice and equal rights, it never act like no snake. But when my horse are off, so they cancel, sell a yarn to life and set good example. No matter how much strong, they freak them cancel, and still I get trampled. Ah! The more the wicked, the reggae dead. The more reggae spread, the more deep and jiggly red. One look is more than reggae flesh. There's people reggae dead. Burnhouse jiggly dead. The more the wicked the reggae spread, I know. Question, where have you been, great one? Righteousness, the whole world awaits on. Nuff a hock, step the kush, stop sing. Them fight against the eye, true eye. Nothin' on the slack thing or flap thing. This is factual, no hearsay. Amos the slackness, get your play. Nuff chase, dumb vanity, and lost your way.
