20251215 151309 I'm a real brother to them No matter what they're stuck around Good friends better than pocket money No fear rise and them start off funny yo But me real brothers never change Who that saw me and who that saw me Watcha now Real friends don't change Real friends don't chance Never all when life gets a turn for the worst I got my own show concerned for you first Ayana, you say, in the life, true friends not come often. But the chosen few may have forgotten. Marie.
