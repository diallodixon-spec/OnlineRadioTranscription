Let me feel like I'm in a dream Let me go like a bulldozer Can you leave this girl's dream You make me know how to be the lady Can you give me love every day? Can you love. I have to be a woman to be on top of your bed. I've got to be the woman, but you won't do it again. I'm so missing you. Big old gal, you know you're miss 45. Superwoman, a man of faith, you can't find the size. Gal, don't worry, girl, your career will shine. Sexy, but the gal ain't the grandest.
