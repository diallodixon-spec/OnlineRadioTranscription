I'm coming home tonight I'm not coming home tonight Don't sign in the party Girl, don't send no self-party to find me I'm not going home tonight I'm drunk in the party So I don't think no such party can find me. I'm not coming home tonight. I'm not going home tonight. It's a drunk in the party. So why don't you go to such party to find me? I was clapped by the melodies. Now the liquor take all of me. And the bass knock my soul out. And it's just so God won't let me leave. I don't know if I'll survive. Song after song, wine after wine. I go sing strong and fit for life. Weak like the masses crimp tonight. You can't find me where bumper's shaking. Higher meeting, people fighting. So complain if they want it, no. Tell them you can't find me out on the road. I'm ready to walk. Chest up, walk. Time to free up. Gonna bow, let me go.
