So protecting yourself from the opportunists that are around there so that you are safe for the Christmas and that your family members get the goods and the gifts that they should receive. And some of the persons are also getting in their goods for sale during the festive season. So I want to thank you so much for sharing with us and we want to thank you also for working to keep us safe. The entire JCF, I know, is doing a lot of work to try and keep us safe during the festive season, so we are reminding all listeners as well to try and ensure that they keep safe. And as SSP Lindsey says, you have reduced the administrative role of many of the JCF members and they are now ultimately trying to take care of us to ensure that we are being safe and being secure as the festive season approaches. So I want to thank you so much for that as well. Thank you so much.
