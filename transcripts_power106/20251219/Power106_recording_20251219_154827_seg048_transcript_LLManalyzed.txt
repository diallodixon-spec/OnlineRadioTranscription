20251219 154827 Thanking God as well for this beautiful day that he has blessed us with. I know that when we have these beautiful days and we just oppose that against what happened with Melissa, it is hard for some people to wrap their minds around a God that is so grand that we can have these two parallels. But yet here it is that we are. Doesn't this day represent the fact that there is hope? Yes. Yes. You know, I heard something beautiful. When you put a seed in the ground and we cover it with dirt. So the bystander who doesn't understand any agriculture is like, what are you doing to that seed? Why are you burying it? But the real point is that through the seed is going to be buried. It's able to grow up to be a beautiful tree and give delicious fruits. So too, sometimes in our eyes we get storms. We don't understand what's the purpose, why this happened. And it's hard because people lost their lives. People lost their houses. People lost their businesses.
