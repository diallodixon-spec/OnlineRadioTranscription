In terms of the filing of this appeal, what's the time frame to file? I don't have that before me. It might be a 14-day time frame. Same 14 days. And once it is filed, is there any time frame as to when this arm will be aired? Well, that's up to the court when the court schedules it. And of course, the legislation says that the hearing of it must commence within 60 days after it's filed and must continue every lawful day until its conclusion so it's not where it is it's not one of those matters where the court can adjourn today and say coming back in february it must continue every day every lawful day
