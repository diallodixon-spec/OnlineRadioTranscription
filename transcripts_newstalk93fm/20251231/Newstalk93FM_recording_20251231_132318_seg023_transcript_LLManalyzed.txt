20251231 132318 to somebody that can make me feel safe. Yeah. Look, I don't want a couple, but nobody ever made me feel safe like you. Because when I'm with you, I just know I'm fine. You take all the pressure off my mind all the time. Patient in time will not be going out of my mind. Say from the problems, I don't worry because I'm hard to find. Say if I like i just ran and slid across the plate safe like we playing tag in your home base safe like i got a big dog in the gate safe like you one of these play in my face yeah you know i know you know that i'm that right you got a girl that wanna get right when i spass and i crash you ain't gon' dip, right? That's when I need you the most. That's how I get right. Baby, if I'm safe, it runs after safe. Safe like the money, let it sit up in the bank. Safe like a code with the alarm after safe. Nobody go right by my side.
