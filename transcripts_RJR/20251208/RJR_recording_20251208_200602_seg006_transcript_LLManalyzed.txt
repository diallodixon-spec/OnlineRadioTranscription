============================================================

You love me forgive me in spite of it all And when they come for me When people lie You provide a way out so I can't give up Look how far you've carried me Can't give up You give me strength when I am weak Can't give up Cause as far as I can see Can't give, with every breath that's left in me. Victory, my God, my God, victory. My God, my God. My God. My God, how you love me.
