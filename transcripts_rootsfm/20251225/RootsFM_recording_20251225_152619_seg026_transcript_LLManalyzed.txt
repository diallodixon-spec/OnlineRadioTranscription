20251225 152619 I never been a feddy, but I seen a feddy Take a piece of evidence and plant it on the scene already We see them kill seven youth out there I never shoot out the execution, I saw them it out the pop. I heard an echo round the ghetto. I hear it from a distant hill. A response still. I get an instant chill when infants die. When them drive by in an instant sigh and things start flying. They're my child. Even though the times get hard and the minds set hard. No, me can't let fear. Me a try. Even though the body dem a pile and the gun dem a aisle. Can't lift off a missile. Me a try even though the times get rough now and life gets snuff out, them things we are tough out, we try. No matter what a talk and no matter what a spark, you are just the one in my heart, we try.
