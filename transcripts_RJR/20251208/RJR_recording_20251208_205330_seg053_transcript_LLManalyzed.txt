============================================================

I should be playing in the winter snow, but I'ma be under the mistletoe. I don't want to miss out on the holiday, but I can't stop staring at your face. We are now at the end of the road. I'ma be under the mistletoe Word on the streets and it's comin' at night Rain deers flyin' through the sky so high I should be makin' a list, I know I'ma be Under the Mistletoe Shorty with you Shorty with you
