20251223 175234 As David Baylor said, we've provided millions of meals, but behind every number there is a family and there's a neighbor and there's a child. And really it's not just about quantity, it's about dignity and consistency and trust, understanding that with a stability. And when people know that a meal is coming, they can focus on rebuilding, on their kids, on what comes next. And you can calm fear and create a space for hope. And that's what we're here to do. And through finding all of these communities, through growing this network and through seeing all of this, what stays with me the most and with all of us the most is the resilience and the generosity of the community themselves. Because as we show up, as we open these distribution points of hot meals or now meal kits, it's really the community that is organizing that. So we just provide the resources to that community. That might be a church, a community center, a school, someone that volunteer their house, or basically a tent in the middle of a field, which we have a couple of those.
