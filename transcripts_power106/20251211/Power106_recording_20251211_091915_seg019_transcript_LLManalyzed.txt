The U.S. budget deficit for the fiscal year 2022 was $1.4 trillion compared to $2.8 trillion for the fiscal year 2021. Meanwhile, the Congressional Budget Office projected a deficit of $1.54 trillion in 2023. This was being driven by the higher interest rate regime being pursued by the Fed, but it zipped to $2 trillion or 7.55% of GDP by the end of the fiscal year on September 30, 2023, but fell to $1.8 trillion or 6.66% of GDP on September 30, 2024. The number of Americans applying for first-time unemployment insurance assistance jumped by 44,000 to 236,000 last week compared with the revised 192,000 recorded in the previous week bringing the total to almost 134.877 million workers since the unwelcomed intervention of the deadly COVID-19 pandemic in January 2020.
