Everybody clap, let's go. Somebody make some noise in the building. We going up. The Bible says, how can two whores accept they agree? So can you give your neighbor a high five and say, I agree. Say it y'all. I agree. That's all we got. Y'all got it out there. Raise it up. I agree. Look across the aisle and tell somebody. I agree. I can't hear you. If you agree what God tells about you, say it again. Everybody say, I agree. Come on. Put some harmony on it, y'all. I agree. I agree. He cannot. He cannot. Let's go. I agree.
