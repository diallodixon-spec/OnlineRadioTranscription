How are your friends? They are fine. And learning is back on track? Yes. What's your favorite subject? Math and language arts. I like language arts. I can't really do the maths, but I like language arts as well. Yeah. Have you thought about what school you want to go to when you get to grade six? What high school you want to get to? No, we haven't thought about that yet. No. All right. Fair. All right. So, Annalee, do you want to share your number on air? So for anybody who wants to reach out to you or yeah, go ahead. 5 6 9 5 5 0 6. Repeat it one more time for me. 8 7 6 5 6 9 5
