20251230 172514 The problem is I want your body like a fiend, like a bad habit Bad habits, how to break when I'm with you Yeah, I know I can do it on my own But I want that real full moon, like magic and it takes two Problematic The problem is when I'm you, I'm an addict And I need some relief My skin and your teeth Can't't see the forest through the trees. Got me down on my knees, darling, please. I'm losing control when you're not next to me. I'm falling apart right in front of you Can't you see I lose control When you're not near me
