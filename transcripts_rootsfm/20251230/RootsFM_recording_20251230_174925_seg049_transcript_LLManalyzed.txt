Nobody loves tomorrow If you know the fact, let that hold me tight We'll be forever, so love me now or never, babe I know the truth is bitter, so give me something But then it's over I know your woo woo is over But baby spread all over me Hope I see my mother Who'll be there forever So love me now or never I know the truth it's bitter
