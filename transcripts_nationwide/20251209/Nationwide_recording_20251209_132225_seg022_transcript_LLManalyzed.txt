Baby, we take away everything good in my life And tell me now How do I live without you? I want you to know How do I breathe without you? If you ever go, how do I ever, ever survive? How do I, how do I, oh, how do I live without you? It's undeniable that we should be together It's unbelievable how I used to say that I'd fall in love
