20251229 150910 I don't know. I don't know what I'm doing. I'm doing it. I'm going to do it. I'm gonna do it. I can't do it. Taking a ride, a ride a ride a ride, it's alright Me and someone else Taking a ride a ride A ride a ride, that's all right It's all right Losing a round with a cheap pool of honeys Each one want to introduce a beer to their mummies Some want me to pack up and come over with my luggage The ride out, the ride out, it will be rugged My loving altitude, it's feeling cold, bloody cold
