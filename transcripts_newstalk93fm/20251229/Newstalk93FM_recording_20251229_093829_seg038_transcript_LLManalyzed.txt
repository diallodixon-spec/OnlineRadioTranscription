My take on my muse. Everything my baby, my rhythm my blues. So many things you do, nobody do like you do. Carrying you from my head, my shoulder, toes. I did do do, carry you from my head my shoulder. I got for you my knees and toes. When you behind me, I know I'm super. Nobody do me like you do, baby.
