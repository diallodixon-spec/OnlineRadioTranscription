20260102 153314 Repeat. The gift of life, walk away from trouble, stay away from strife. Life is to live to the best in life. You only live once, you're not live twice, yo. Follow the road on the righteous path, stay focused and conscious, put your inner thoughts aside. Don't make the wicked, them corrupt your heart. Do the right thing, become the one, yes, yes, all. Take away yourself from trouble, from trouble, because it come in a double, take away yourself from trouble. I say mind is sinking, son. Take away yourself, from trouble, take away yourself, come trouble, because it comes in a double.
