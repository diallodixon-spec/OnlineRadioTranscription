20251225 094421 I'm sick of playing all of these games It's not about taking sides When I looked in the mirror, didn't deliver It hurt enough to think that I could stop Admit that I'm wrong and then change my mind Sorry but I gotta be strong and leave you behind I can't waste time so give it a moment I realize nothing's broken Don't need to worry about everything I've done Live every second like it was my last one Don't look back at a new direction i love you once you needed protection you're still a part of everything i do you're on my heart just like a tattoo just like a tattoo i'll always have you
