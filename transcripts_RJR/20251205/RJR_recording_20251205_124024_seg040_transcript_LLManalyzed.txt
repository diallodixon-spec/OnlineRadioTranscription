electricity. So I suppose we have to go back to... Send Fodgy down, Mars Danzi down there. Mars Danzi is still alive? I don't think so. When I pass out there, I must find out. Mars Danzi used to live sort of right in front of Venture School. I'm trying to remember the man who used to do the ice cream, you know, if he was Mars Darrell. I think it was Mars Darrell, his name, you know. Oh. Somebody from Carlsberg perhaps can remind me. But yeah. But it's a shame that you didn't have the ice cream cone because I don't like to have the ice cream without the cone. I vaguely remember the cone but I know the box. Yeah. With the cone. What color the box had again? Some green and white. It's a white box but you have green writing. Yeah, yeah, white and green. And picture of the cone on it. On it, right, right. So yes, there may have been some cone there, yes. It was a joy to buy the ice cream though. Joy to, you know. What was your favorite flavor? I don't know if I had any favorite.
