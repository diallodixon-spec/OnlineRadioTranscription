20251215 192320 We don't see much events with Jiu Jitsu in Jamaica. So we decided because we have some practitioners in Jamaica who practice Jiu Jitsu, we want to have a platform of some sort to show what they've practiced or even test what they have learnt throughout the years. And we decided to add it. This is our second year adding it onto the portfolio to have as an event for participants to come and test their skills within that discipline. So the whole event came off lovely. We got a lot of support from corporate and from our community members and really appreciate the support that we've been getting and we are continuing to make it bigger and better. I'll come next year and thinking that we want to bring some persons from the Caribbean to Jamaica.
