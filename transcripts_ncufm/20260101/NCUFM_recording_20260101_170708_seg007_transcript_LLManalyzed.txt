20260101 170708 a historic achievement National Security and Peace Minister Dr. Horace Chang has labeled as a turning of the tide towards sustainable crime reduction. This marks the first time the figure has fallen below 700 since 1994, 31 years ago. In his New Year's Day message, Dr. Chang congratulated the Jamaica Constabulary Force, JCF on the significant reduction in violent crime, noting that this represents a 41% reduction year over year and 473 lives spared. To put this into perspective, he says, compared to 2009, when violent crimes peaked with 1683 murders, the 2025 figure reflects a 60% decline. But the minister emphasized that this is not the end of the journey, stating that the objective is to move below the Caribbean's average homicide rate of 17 per 100,000, which means cutting murders to less than 500 per year
