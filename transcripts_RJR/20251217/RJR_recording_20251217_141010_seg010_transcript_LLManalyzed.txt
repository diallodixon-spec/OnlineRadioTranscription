20251217 141010 When lights are low When you're moving slow It sounds like moan That it's alright, woah, it's alright Now listen to the beat And kinda pat your feet You've got soul And everybody knows That it's all right Whoa, it's all right When you wake up early in the morning Feeling sad like so many of us do Come a little soul, make life your goal And surely surely something's gotta come to you. And say it's alright. Say it's alright. It's alright. Have a good time, cause it's alright.
