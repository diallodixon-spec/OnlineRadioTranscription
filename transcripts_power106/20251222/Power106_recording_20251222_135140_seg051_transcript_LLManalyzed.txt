20251222 135140 I don't know, I'm gonna try, I'm gonna see if I can find anybody at all. Still don't see a name, I've been searching my phone, can't find the name of anybody who I can call, but by the time the day is done, I'm gonna have to try and find somebody to look into his situation by customs. Customs, I'm certain, comes under national security. It can't be that bad. Can't be that somebody goes through that. Someone here says, sorry to hear, Mr. Brown, but it's nothing personal. Coming back to live in J.A. is really straightforward. I've been to so many countries, and this one, the land of my birth, is the only one who has ever threatened to keep me out. I had to behave so badly to get in here because I didn't know the street number of my sister's new residence. Harbour, harbour, harbour. I hate dealing with them.
