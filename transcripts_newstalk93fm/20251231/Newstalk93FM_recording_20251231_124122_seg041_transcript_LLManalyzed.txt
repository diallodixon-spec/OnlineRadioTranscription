20251231 124122 What I apply for my belly, you giving me energy. I don't want to lose my composure, cause me losing control. Giving me more than I need. Everything where you got it for party. Even if what I got in me, baby. Nothing to device you, my old reggae. My rhythm, my blues. My activity, everything from Monday to Sunday. Say you be my gold, nobody do me like you do And you take on my muse, everything, my baby My rhythm and blues, so many things you did do nobody Do me carry, you play happy to lose Carry my love, put it all on you and I get the money, money
