20251219 194126 They all sit and wonder why This feeling I cannot hide It ain't a question of pride They say I'm trippin' The way you got my whole life flippin' They say I'm lovin' it Just can't seem to keep my grip, baby. We all cry when we feel pain. When love is gone, we're not the same. It ain't no question of race.
