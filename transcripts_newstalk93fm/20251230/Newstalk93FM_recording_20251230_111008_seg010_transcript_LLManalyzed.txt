20251230 111008 I knew what to expect Do you wanna take a skate? On the ice inside my veins They ripped me off like false lashes And then threw me away And all the headshots on the walls Of the dance hall are of the witches Who wish I'd hurry up and die But I'm immortal now, baby dolls I couldn't if I tried So I say Thank you for the lovely book, hey I'm married to the hustle and now I know the life of a showgirl, babe And I'll never know another Pain hidden by the lipstick and lace Sequins are forever and now I know the life of a showgirl, babe Wouldn't have it any other way, oh Wouldn't have any other way
