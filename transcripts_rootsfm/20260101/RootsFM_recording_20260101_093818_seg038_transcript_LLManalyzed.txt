20260101 093818 I want to but I can't help it I love the way it feels This got me stuck between my fantasy and what is real I need it when I want it I want it when I don't Tell myself I'll stop every day Knowing that I won't I got a problem and I Even if I did, I don't know if I would quit But I doubt it, I'm Taken by the thought of it And I know that much is true Baby, you have become my addiction I'm so strong out on you I can barely move, but I like it
