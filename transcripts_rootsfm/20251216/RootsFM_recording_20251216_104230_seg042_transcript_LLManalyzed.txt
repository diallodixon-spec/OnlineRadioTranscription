20251216 104230 to IOJ, which are open and having, you know, events on that day as well. You can jump on the bus right at the intersection of Harbor Street and Church Street, and then you just jump off, jump on and do a circuit of downtown to all the different areas and attractions that are open. I think it's $1,500 for the bus. You can buy your tickets on Culture Connect app, the K-U-L-C-H-A Connect. So you can go ahead and purchase your ticket in advance, or you can just buy it on the day at the Kingston Creative Information booth. Now, I must mention we have other artists as well. Carbon, Jorn, Snagapus. All of these artists will be coming through. These are artists local to the city of Kingston. And so a lot of fun and excitement for everybody, as well as, of course, the shopping. Oh, yes. I mean, can you imagine? Because just a week or so before Christmas and Kwanzaa, the shop took a drop. Yes, it's gifting time. So we're just talking about intentional, conscious gifting this year.
