20251222 100203 for all human beings you know that you have created in your image and likeness omnipotent omnipresent give thanks to plants and animals which are a beautiful part of your creation. Give thanks to the elements of life. Eat air, earth and water. But I give thanks to music, you know. But through music or mosaic, I still answer the first. I've made an instrument to manifest the holy works. Omnipotent, omnipresent, rule of creation.
