20260101 091812 I feel your frequency from miles away. You come alive with one wine, baby. With you, I want to dance the night away. One jam, turn a lifetime, baby. So don't feel away. You don't like the fast life The look on the bright side I go take the blame I just want you come and bite the top Just a little winding up Come and meet me behind the truck and we rev it up Whole day Keep throwing it back, I know why you stop Baby, no way We could post up all the pictures you want when you're ready. I go over here, darling. You go over there. But we could meet in the middle and start a bacchanal. Play in the middle, hey.
