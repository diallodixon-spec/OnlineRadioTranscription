I suspect, but I'm not saying that that was irrational, where it was being mooted or raised, you know, but I suspect, especially what is happening now, let me tell you, other things are being said, you know, and persons may say things in, I'm sure you, if not very often, maybe not, but on social media, you see things being said and threats being uttered and what have you. As I paint the point out to someone who sent a WhatsApp message in, that there are options here. There are laws that deal with incitement, issues of public mischief, threats and so on. Criminal library has really had its genesis in criticism and the reputation of say public officials. And that happened way back when, from the time of Henry VIII. And some countries still have it. India has it, some states in the U.S. has it. But that's also challenged in other cases in the U. S. So there's a lot of thinking on it and reading on it.
