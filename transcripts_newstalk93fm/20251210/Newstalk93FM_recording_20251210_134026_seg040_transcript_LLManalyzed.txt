I need a long time Girl, I'll be your best, and I'll be the best again When you ask for sex again Don't care about the rest of them, you're starting to forget See what I'm saying, you don't hear me You better tell, I'll treat you well I will, it's good I can tell Come give me hell, come here Your fairy tale Under your spell, I answer She gets your nail, oh well, it all depends You scream and yell, can't come for help, come here You're leaving wells, I'll fill your nails, for real I hit you good, you're sleeping good, for real I read you out, I read you time it is. Get on my locket it be the box again
