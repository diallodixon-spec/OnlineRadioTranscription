A busy lifestyle looks like always rushing, chasing deadlines, juggling responsibility, always on your feet, never taking a moment to appreciate the mundane things in life. But Psalm 46 verse 10 reminds us to be still and know that I am God. Even in business, God calls us to pause and find peace. He calls us to acknowledge his presence, his working in our lives, so that we can not so much focus on everything that we have going on, but to remember that he is always there.
