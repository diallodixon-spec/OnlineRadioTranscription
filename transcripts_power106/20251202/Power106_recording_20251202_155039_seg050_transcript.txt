I continue to focus as well on the fact that in this month of December, it's usually a joyous time, a time where families come together and they enjoy themselves. The tone of Christmas is going to be different because there has to be a lot of concern about those families that are not going to be feeling as good as the rest of us over the Christmas period because of the challenges they have faced and continue to face as a result of Hurricane Melissa. But even in the midst of that we still have to find ways of lifting our spirits. So give you now the Pentatonix Joy to the World.
