20260101 155136 We're going up, up, up, it's our moment. You know together we're glowing. Gonna be, gonna be golden. Up, up, up with our voices. Going to get you so warm then. Gonna be gonna be golden. I'm done hiding. Now I'm shining like I'm born to be. Oh, our time, no fears, no lies. Let's who we're born to be. Waited so long to break these walls down To wake up and feel like me Put these patterns all in the past now and finally live like the girl they all see no more hiding i'll be shining like i'm born to be cause we are hunters boys
