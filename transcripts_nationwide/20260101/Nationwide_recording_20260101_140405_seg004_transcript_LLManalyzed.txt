20260101 140405 All I do is lay you down Two ears full of tears From looking at your face on the wall Just a week ago you were my baby Now I don't even know you at all I don't know you at all Well I wish that you would call me right now So that I could get through to you somehow But I guess it's safe to say, babe Safe to say that I'm official at this new Can't nobody do it like you Said every little thing you do Hey baby, say it stays on my mind
