20251215 135635 term reconstruction solutions are being finalized. The program will be led by the National Works Agency NWA and forms part of the wider Post Melissa recovery effort which also includes medium and long term reconstruction projects to be rolled out under other capital programs. Minister Morgan has vowed that the road works will be closely monitored to ensure value for money and timely delivery. Approximately $35 billion in road damage has been recorded following Hurricane Melissa, with more than 396 roadways affected. Still on roads, with roadway connectivity being the pulse of local activity, farmers are thrilled to know that $800 million has been earmarked to repair farm roads in western parishes. West Milan, St. James, Hanover and St. Elizabeth, among Jamaica's most productive parishes, suffered a devastating blow from Hurricane Melissa.
