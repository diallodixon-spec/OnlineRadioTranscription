20251223 134428 In Joshua 24 verse 22. Let me just read that for you Joshua 24 verse 22 says and Joshua said unto the people ye are witnesses against yourselves ye have chosen you the Lord to serve him and They said we are witnesses So they have chosen the Lord and they decided to serve him. Now, in other words, Bahar, to choose, describes Yahweh's election of Israel. Yahweh choosing Israel. Israel is free to say no to Yahweh after their divine election. But that would be nonsensical and absurd. Israel can say yes to God and continue to live, or they can turn their backs on Him and cease to exist. What was Israel's response to Joshua's appeal?
