20251222 124221 Last night I dreamed that you were here with me And we were in each other's arms, it was oh so heavenly You held me close to you and whispered in my ear Let's spend the night together Sharing love beyond the band As we dance to the melody We have so much to share It was just a dream. Haunting me once again. A dream. A simple fact.
