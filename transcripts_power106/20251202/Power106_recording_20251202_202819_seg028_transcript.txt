============================================================

First time I saw you go You say you need me But then your own friends Told you to leave me And now you're running back You're begging for mercy But I will hear you cry Cause I still love you Hold hold on Don't let go, hold on If you do love me, hold on So you will lose me no time So you'll be mine, so you'll be mine
