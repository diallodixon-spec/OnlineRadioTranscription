Let no man curse I put the family first Though sometimes it hurts So glad we're together here on earth Wagwan's history It's been so long since we've spoken Though we're struggling in them systems Our spirit is still unbroken, yeah Park one brother So glad you're looking after your mother And they say we're not getting any younger But every day we get stronger and wiser Trying to make things right Cherish these precious times Oh, just shine your light on us Show us the way to go
