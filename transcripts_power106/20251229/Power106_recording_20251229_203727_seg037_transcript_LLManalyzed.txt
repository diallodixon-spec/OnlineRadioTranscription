20251229 203727 groups. We had 250 persons in the Jamaica Federal Circuit to speak to the stakeholders that we need because they're looking at persons from the government of Jamaica, ministry department, agency, international development partners who have been pivotal to the fight, making sure that we are able to meet our requirements and match what were mandated and students and youth groups at the event. Some of those students were a part of our GAP program. So the GAP is an acronym for Gender Ambassadors Program. And that program is a nexus between gender and education. Being an educator myself, I recognize that you must bring students in and interface with them so that they understand how gender impacts their lives.
