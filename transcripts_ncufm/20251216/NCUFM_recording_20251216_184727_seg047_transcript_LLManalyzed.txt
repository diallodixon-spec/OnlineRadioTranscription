Now, you not only get to hear us but you get to see us as well. Yes. So, join us, won't you? Every first Tuesday of every month, you can tune in on YouTube via NCU TV Jamaica, or you can watch us on the FloTV channels, 617 or 188. Join us as we chart the path to a healthier you, right here on Let's Talk Healthy. Thanks for watching!
