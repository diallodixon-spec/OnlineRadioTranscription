We need a jingler. Forward at the studio, my brother. Fix things. Alright so now it's time for the break but before we go, Jeefus, let the world know which station is the number one station and which day is the best day of the week. That is it, G-Force, Big Up Yourself and the Stone Love Crew. All right, remember, where you at it tonight? You don't know it's the hottest thing on a Wednesday night. G-Force Big Up Yourself. All right, time for the break. When we come back, more reggae music for you.
