Residents are being urged to report any information that may assist investigators, particularly if they noticed suspicious activity in the area on Sunday night or early Monday morning. A police constable is among two men arrested following the seizure of ammunition at a residence in Rhymesbury, Clarendon. Reports are that police were conducting surveillance at a funeral service on Sunday when they observed suspicious activity involving two men. One of the men was later identified as a police constable assigned to a specialized unit of the Jamaican Stabulary Force. During checks, the constable reportedly told investigators that he had handed a firearm to a relative. However, a subsequent search of the area did not result in the recovery of any firearm. Police later searched the constable's residence, where four 9-millimeter rounds of ammunition were reportedly found inside a bag containing his police identification. Investigators say the constable is not a licensed firearm holder.
