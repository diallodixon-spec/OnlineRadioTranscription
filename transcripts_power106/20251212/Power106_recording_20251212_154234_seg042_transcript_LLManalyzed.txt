20251212 154234 So this mobile claims unit, right after Hurricane Melissa, you said earlier it was deployed, tell us a bit more about that and how long will the unit remain active? So the unit was deployed on November 12th, so today is our one month anniversary. Congratulations! We have been journeying to those affected areas and the areas that we have been we have been going to are Sablamar, Montego Bay, Santa Cruz and Mandeville. We go there every week so we have several trips to the different locations every week and we'll continue to do this for as long as our customers need us. Each week we go we see see more persons. Word has gotten out, so persons are actually there before the teams get to the locations because we're coming from Kingston. So it just really reinforces for us that we're doing good work and we're doing work that our customers need.
