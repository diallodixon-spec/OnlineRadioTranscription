20251224 214821 is my heart to rock you steady. I'll give you love the time you're ready. This little heart in me just won't let me be. I'm just rocking now. Won't you rock with me? A long, long, long, time. We don't have no nice time. Thank you. Thank you. Merry Christmas again. We'll have a drink and eat. Drink so little and eat Christmas cake and nothing stop. We have to enjoy ourselves. Give thanks for the light.
