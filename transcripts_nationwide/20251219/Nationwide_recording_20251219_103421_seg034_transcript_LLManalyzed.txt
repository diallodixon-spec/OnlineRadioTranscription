20251219 103421 As a fitness guy, I was surprised by my chronic illness diagnosis. I thought working out hard I would fix it, but it wasn't enough. Now, my prescription meds are a part of my routine. When I got my diagnosis, I really felt down and stopped spending time with the people I love. Then I decided not to let any disease get the best of me and I'm committed to taking. Now at Mothers, you can pay it forward. With just $300, you can donate a meal to someone in need. Because sometimes a warm meal is more than a belly full. It's hope, comfort and a reason to smile.
