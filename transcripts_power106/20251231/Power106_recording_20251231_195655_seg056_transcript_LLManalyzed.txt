And my technical men who have interchanged over the years, Adrian Reed and Gavin Thomas, thank you very much gentlemen for your support. I will look forward to what's going to be happening next year. All right. We won't be here tomorrow actually. I'll be at King Manas Park and won't finish in time to make it back and start up this program because the last race is going to be run very close to 6 o'clock so we won't be here tommorow, New Year's Eve, but on Friday we'll be back to present the Friday edition and it should be a special one, Friday edition of Power Play. Musically, here is a song I think that is appropriate for New Year's Eve believe believe it or not, if that even happens. And I want you to look optimistically at what's going to be happening in 2026 and beyond. And the first day of 2026 will be tomorrow.
