20251231 104931 This is Clive Mullings. Hello, good morning. Hello. Hello. Yes, sir. Hey, morning. Welcome. Sir Mullings, how are you? I'm fine, thank you. How are you doing, all right? Pardon? How are you? Welcome. I'm good, you know. I'm good. I'm good I'm good. All right, you were very strong yesterday. And I'm still strong. You know the problem I have with this country is the PR. And you have some people, if they are benefiting, because all of a sudden now, those who were out there talking 10, 15, 20 years ago, they're not dead. They're still strong. Since they're Jamaican, they're not going nowhere. But because they're benefiting, you understand, nothing at all now no bother them.
