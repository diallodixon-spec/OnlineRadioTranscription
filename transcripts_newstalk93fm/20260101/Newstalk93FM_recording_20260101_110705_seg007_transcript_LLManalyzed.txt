20260101 110705 The angels up in the clouds are jealous knowing we found. Oh, please, hallelujah. Oh, this side of heaven's gate. Oh, my life, I'll do ya. Breathe it, take my breath away. At your altar, I will pray You're the sculptor, I'm the clay Oh my my, you're taking me out From the ordinary I want you laying me down So we're dead and buried On the edge of your night Staying drunk on your vibe The angels up in the clouds are jealous no one can bow. So they say wow, wow, what a name. You got me kissin' the crowd. Sanctuary, chatter me when you're done. Oh Lord, return me to die.
