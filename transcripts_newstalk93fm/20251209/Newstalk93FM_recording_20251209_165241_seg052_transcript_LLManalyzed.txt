I wish my wife and my sweet heart could be friends. And when we going on a date, me and bring both of them. I wish my wife, and my sweetheart could be friends. And when the tree not jealous, none of them not bad-minded. Life would be really sweet, three of us walking down easy street. And everybody askin' how I do it, me just askin' me deep.
