20251224 102111 Now I'm riding this wave with you All my girlfriends, they disapprove But you are, you're my peace and mine Mine, mine, ooh, all mine But they criticize, why, why, Why, why, oh why Somebody nice So nice, so nice, so nice Never catch a vibe that feels so right When you're not around I close my eyes and fantasize Lord, he's sweet So sweet, so sweet, so sweet Every time he passed me skin me teeth Me and the melody and him and the beat So we do it Who you remember? Every word your eyes spoke to me the sweetest surrender
