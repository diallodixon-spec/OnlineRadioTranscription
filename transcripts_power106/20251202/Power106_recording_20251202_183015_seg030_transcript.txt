============================================================

resolve and our unity. We have to continue to do that. We really appreciate the support we get. We felt that on Sunday morning, waking up to all the congratulatory messages that we received from the people in Jamaica and the diaspora around the world. I have to continue because that is what drives these players to go out there and put on their shirt and represent their country the way they do. So may that continue and really grateful for all the support that we've had, grateful for the opportunity like this to come on and we are looking forward to supporting you with everything we can possibly do going forward. Thanks for being on the show, sir. Great. Thanks for having me. All the best. You are most welcome.
