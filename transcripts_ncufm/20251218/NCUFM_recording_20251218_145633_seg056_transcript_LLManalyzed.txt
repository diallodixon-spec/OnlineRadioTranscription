20251218 145633 He called to me Said child I will set you free Oh you'll have a life abundantly Life abundantly Because I love Because I love He gave unselfishly Caused my blinded eyes to shake It was you and me he had in mind On that road to Calvary I've never known such a perfect love I had fallen down but he picked me up He rescued my soul Now I want the world to know Because of love he left the grave Prepared for us a place He'll be back again someday He's coming back for me
