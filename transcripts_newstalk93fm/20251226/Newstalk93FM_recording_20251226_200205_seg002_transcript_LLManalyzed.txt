20251226 200205 Limited liability Don't worry If you try all the things I like You could still be shy in the morning So don't feel away You don't like the fast life But look on the bright side, girl I go take the blame I just want you come and rise it up Just a a little winding out Come and meet me in the truck and we rev it up Say hold it, keep throwing it back I know why you stopped us Baby no way, we got most of all the pictures you want When you're ready, I go over here But we compete in the middle and start a bacchanal Play in the middle hey, what we to do now? Jam to a rhythm, heat a carnival. What are we gonna do now? Start a wine on it. I say compromise on it. Baby, spend time on it.
