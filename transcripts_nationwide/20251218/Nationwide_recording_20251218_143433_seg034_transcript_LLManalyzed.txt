20251218 143433 So I took up a beer and decided to drink Before we even pour the same You might remember me but I've been against with you Never since the night we met that I must tell you true You danced into my life over and over and over And between me and my man it's all over And I just want us now to get closer Trust me now I have to tell you a story about what one dance can do One dance can do, one dance can do And listen that, everyone dance on the floor She can dance on the floor
