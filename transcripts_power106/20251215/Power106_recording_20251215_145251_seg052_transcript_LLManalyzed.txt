They say they don't see it, I can't find it anywhere. I have gone to the land office on Church Street and Hanover Street. And they gave me the procedures and the papers on what I should do. What I want to ask you though, if a title is found, what could someone do with that title in the meantime while I'm preparing to get a duplicate title. They could forge your signature and sell the property. They could forge an ID as seen before and borrow money using it. Oh boy. Yeah, so act quickly. Ask the title offices if they would, because you could put a caveat on it.
