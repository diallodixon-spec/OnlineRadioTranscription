Except for vegetables. Okay, let's go look over that section to see what's there. Okay, just need cabbage, carrots and cucumbers to make the salad. See if you find any of those. Mummy, I see everything in the fridge. Just pick up some nice ones so we can make a good salad. If you see purple cabbage, take up some, at least one of those, right? I want to make the salad look nice and colourful. Okay. I think this is everything, you know. We should be able to go cash out now. Mrs, why are you in such a hurry? You don't plan to drink anything with the food? I just saw some meat you want to eat. Alright. Oh, we need rice and peas and stuff to make soup. Silicone over here. Alright. Just take up a pack of that and um let's get the rice and see if we can't find any sorry.
