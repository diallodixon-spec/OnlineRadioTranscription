============================================================

I said five in the morning, I wake up to five for my earnings. Fear in my mind is a warning. Pray to the one you're relying. I've been wandering all day. I tried to be fine, but I can't be. The noise in my mind wouldn't leave me. I tried to get by, but I behind my mind it runs all these thoughts of traveling fighting to give up my pain fighting to be on my lane my mind running to the other side when it's time to leave my life then it tries to pick me up tell you what i need right here I really need I really need time now I really need, I need to free my mind now
