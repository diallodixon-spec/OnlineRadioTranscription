consideration very happy I am to be living in a country 25 years into the 21st century where we can lend a hundred and fifty million US dollars to an entity like JPS that said the questions about whether or not the loan is sufficient given what JPS needs about 450 million U.S. it says to be able to do all of the restoration work and it's not just doing the work you know that's the critical thing it's the timeliness of the completion of the work those are good questions so I know some of some of the supporters are the government's a lot what am it? What about a? Flock the host of a why why are you? Continuing with questions about if that enough the government now put up 150 million u.s. Already and they say that there are some funds in the 6.7 billion u.s. Dollar package that the JPS can access and so forth. So what's the big issue is?
