============================================================

With many children now staying with relatives, friends, neighbours or in shelters after the hurricane, we must be extra vigilant. If you suspect any form of violence, abuse or neglect, report it immediately by calling 2-1-1. Let's protect our children, no matter where they are. If something doesn't feel right, speak up. Every child deserves to be safe. A message brought With Substance on Hotline. Radio Jamaica, active for the good of our nation.
