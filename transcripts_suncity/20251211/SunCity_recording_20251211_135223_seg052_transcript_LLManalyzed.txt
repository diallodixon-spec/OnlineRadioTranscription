============================================================

I'll be faithful, all for real And with us you'll always know the deal We've been too strong for too long And I can't be without you baby And I'll be waiting up until you get home Cause I can't sleep without you baby If anybody who's out would love to know just what I feel Too hard to fake it, nothing can replace it. Call a radio if you just can't be without you, baby. Yeah. See, this is real talk. Come on, always stay. No matter what, good or bad, make a plan, right or wrong, on every day. Hey. Now if you're down on love or don't believe, this ain't for you. No, this aint for you. Hands up, you got it deep in your heart. And deep down, you know that it's true. Come on, come on, come on. Well, let me see you put your hands up.
