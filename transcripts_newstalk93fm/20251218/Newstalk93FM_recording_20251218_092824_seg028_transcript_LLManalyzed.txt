20251218 092824 tell you that one of the sweet spots you know doing something like what we're doing here is when you go out there and people hear you people say oh I'm fireman oh me Conrad this is O'Brien boy we're really happy for what you're doing and so on we listen to you daily and that sort of things and so on and if I don't get to listen to you live we go back and revisit the program especially now that we are up on the YouTube channel so we are indeed delighted but yesterday most of all my heart was warm because I come upon a group of students at a particular high school in Central Jamaica and they were saying Mr. Brian we love you we listen to you and so on and it was a little different because that's the very young demographics and from time to time you hear people say boy young people not listen to talk radio and so on
