Let me tell you, once you have family and friends and you, listen, it was such a joyful time even though it was, you know, it was disastrous at the time. I know that even in this time, persons that have lost a lot, once we start to just go down with love and we visit our family and our friends, let me tell you, it will be a glorious time. I went to Montego to visit some friends of ours, basically like family, you know, and it was still a joyful time. A lot of things weren't there. We didn't have water, we didn't have any light, but they had the roof over their heads. Food was scarce, you know, but we still managed to have a good time. If we can go and stay with our family and our friends and enjoy the Christmas, trust me, that is something that you can't really put a price on. Definitely, definitely, definitely.
