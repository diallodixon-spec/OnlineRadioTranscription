If you don't have that in there, you just go straight to saying, I want to will my host to whoever your will is still valid. So the role of the executor is to carry out your wishes. So you will your host to Susan. It is your executor's role, your executor's duty, I should say, to ensure that your wishes are adhered to. If for whatever reason you do not name an executor in your will, it's still valid. It's going to be your beneficiaries who can now step into your executor's shoes and carry out the process. So it's not that it is pointless to name an executor. It's still of great importance because you know or your beneficiaries will know who to turn to who is the person who you appointed who's the person you want to carry out your wishes so please don't think that because a will is still valid
