============================================================

in the lyrics connected with your own journey, would you say? Well, truth is, like I said earlier, I'm not really the writer for the song. So it was really the writer. It was written from the writer's place. But separate and aside from that, when the song was being written for me specifically, you know, my friend, my friend Pachi, he was saying, you know, boy, Jodie, I just wanted to find true love again. I just wanted to be happy again, type of thing, you know, where that side of life is concerned. So he wrote it from that place for me. And also it's also a very familiar place that many others are going through, you know, whether they have suffered a loss of a relationship and they're hopeful again after five, six, seven years or, you know, whatever it is. Um, it's really. It's really that. But I do feel super hopeful about this season and the rest of the season that's left to come. Yeah, wonderful. Definitely. It definitely gives you that vibe. So the production blends classic Christmas vibes.
