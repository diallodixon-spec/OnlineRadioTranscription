20251217 193121 A message from the Integrity Commission. Now the news. The National Irrigation Commission, NIC, is offering a three-month moratorium to customers in Western Jamaica for outstanding balances up to October 31. NIC Director of Commercial Operations Wayne Barrett says farmers will have up to January 31, 2026, to clear their arrears. Mr. Barrett notes that the move is part of efforts by the Commission to provide financial ease to farmers who are negatively affected by the passage of Hurricane Melissa. The other thing we also implemented was a billing write-off to give them further assistance financially and this billing write-off entailed whatever the bill for current usage was.
