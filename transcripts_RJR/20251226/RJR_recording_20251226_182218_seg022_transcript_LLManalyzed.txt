20251226 182218 Come that Rube, what's criminology off the stimuli, blazing the guts and all that good stuff. Six feet walk with a strut on these New York streets like baby what? Anything can happen, it usually does. I'm from Staten, the island. Beat me on G Street, the galleon. Everything is really nothin' funky. Got a fit rapper half a bungee. He's in it for the munties, M-O-N-E-Y. But you can't take it with you when you die. Salafi high.
