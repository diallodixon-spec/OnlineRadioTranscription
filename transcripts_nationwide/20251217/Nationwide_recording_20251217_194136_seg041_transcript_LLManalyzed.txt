So I am getting a lot of calls from the UN institution looking at that opportunity and working with countries and I certainly expect the same thing to happen in Jamaica. What is your institution would like us to work together? I think the other thing on the insurance, coming from a parametric interest background, I'm certainly not pushing insurance one way or the other. Uh what I'm saying is just response has to be as diverse as possible. Whereby from the ground, the concession financing and insurance and other instrument and leave it to the country to make a decision which one of those two you can actually deploy at the right time to respond. And I think that's why we need to stop being a bit more philosophical about this and think about more in terms of being tangible solutions and then trust the country's maturity and leadership to make decisions. And that's my approach.
