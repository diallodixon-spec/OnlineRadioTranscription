20251217 113936 that JPS have catastrophe insurance that should have taken care of the rebuilding costs. So here you have the government lending them 150 million US of the people's money without real justification to say why did they have to do it? Why didn't the parent company do it? What happened to the insurance that JPS is supposed to have? And at the same time, not standing up and saying, listen, you have to defer this 7% until March or June next year. So it's untenable. It's really bad for the people of Jamaica and the companies in Jamaica. In terms of somebody in your shoes, an exporter as well as an importer, you have to import some of the, I would imagine, some of the teas that you package and put to the market.
