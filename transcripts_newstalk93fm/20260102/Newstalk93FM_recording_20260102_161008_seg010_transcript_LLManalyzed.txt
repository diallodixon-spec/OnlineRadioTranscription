20260102 161008 We're not feeling under the weather You just make me feel sweet Ice the cocoa tea, use the sugar And together we are complete, darling I've been patient And I've been waiting Call me stubborn But I can't get over it You left and never said goodbye Those tears I cried, no, I can't over it So don't you ever let me down again
