20251219 092615 Look at the regiment He wasn't half as happy as me Lord, the peace you bring is worth more than the gold It's healing to my soul for me. And I want to thank you. Little mercies might be wrong. Keep a day in little mercies. Taking for granted all the big things that we have. Nobody's been more blessed than me. Now I want to thank you for your mercies, big and small.
