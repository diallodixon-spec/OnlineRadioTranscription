============================================================

They tell me I'm too young to understand. They say I'm caught up in a dream. Well, life will pass me by if I don't open up my eyes. So that's fine by me. So wake me up when it's all over. When I'm wiser, when I'm older. All this time I was finding myself And I didn't know I was lost.
