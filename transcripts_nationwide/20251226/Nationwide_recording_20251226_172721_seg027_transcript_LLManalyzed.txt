20251226 172721 Just one night And the heavens might be feeling what people do Hold on tight And whatever comes our way, we're gonna make it through Sing to me if you're worth the wait So hold me and tell me it's not too late So that you can start it forever now And I miss you like crazy I miss you like I'm crazy No matter what they say They'll just love love it All of you, and I'll miss you I'll miss you, I'll miss you All the tears of love you gave me And the feeling gets this strong
