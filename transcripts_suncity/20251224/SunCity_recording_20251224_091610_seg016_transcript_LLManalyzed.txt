20251224 091610 All right, guys, welcome back to the Hello Jamaica show. If you're just joining us, my name is Queen Jojo, and it's now time for our feature. I am where we explore the deeper meaning behind some of the most significant teachings in our lives. And today's reflection is anchored in Isaiah nine versus six. Right. And we have Pastor Michael on the line. The verse for to us a child is born to us a son is given he will be called wonderful counselor mighty God everlasting father prince of peace and we have a pastor Michael look like we've lost him on the line to tell us a little bit more about what that means. Pastor Michael, can you hear me? Can you hear me? Yes, I'm hearing you clearly. Did you hear the verse? The scripture? I think I know what the verse is.
