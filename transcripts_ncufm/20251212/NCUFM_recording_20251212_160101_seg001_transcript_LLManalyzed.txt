20251212 160101 One day we'll all be going to a place Where the streets are made of pure gold No more sorrow, no more pain, we'll be there And there we will live forevermore Heaven is my destination We'll be free from tribulation We'll be eating and drinking from the of life. That's where the uncle and the maker will be resting on his throne. We'll be singing holy, holy, holy, Holy to the Lamb. Holy, holy to the Lamb. You are an holy cause. Holy, holy, to the Lamb. It's the Black on NCUFM.
