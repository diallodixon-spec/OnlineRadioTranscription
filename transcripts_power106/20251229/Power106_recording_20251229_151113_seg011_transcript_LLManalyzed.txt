If they apply for title for the entire parcel, their application is based on an inconsistency. It's based on technically they have no not technically they have not occupied the entire property They can only make a claim for the section. They are on Again, if it's one big property five houses, they can only apply for title on the piece that their house is on And if they're applying for adverse adverse possession, the beauty with that is that once there is already a title, they wouldn't have to apply for subdivision. So they can apply again for the piece that they are on.
