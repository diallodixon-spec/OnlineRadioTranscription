20260102 155336 is we've decided the person with the most stars at the end of the year, they are going to be getting a grand prize, courtesy of Mark's Superstore, obviously. And Rick, it was just, come on, like there was a no-brainer. Every single month you have the most stars. Let me just ask you, do you have a special routine to make sure that you beat everybody else in the chat every day? Well, I would say quick fingers. That's it. I did typing in school and I still use typing as a part of my work that I do. Right now I'm still at work. I mean, I have another seven minutes to go, but there's no really trick to it. You just have to be fast, fast fingers. Yeah, yeah. Right now Rick, how can I work in his world because Rick has the fastest fingers. But Rick, I mean, you're here with us from the start, you know what I mean? What is it about the E-Zone that makes it the perfect afternoon show for you? E-Zone is fun, the band, big up the YouTube.
