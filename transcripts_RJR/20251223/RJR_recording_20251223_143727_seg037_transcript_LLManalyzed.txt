I want to say big up to my mother here because my mother, all my life I've known her, she's been an admin manager. Her organizing skills, you know, we grew up in an organized setting. Big up mommy! So the talent come from daddy then? I want to say, you know, mommy even did some piano classes earlier. My daddy's a lover of music, So from earlier we were listening to jazz, we were listening to all different types of music. But yeah, it definitely, as I said, working with Tyrus is a great honor. And even big up Uncle Dean. That's my brother.
