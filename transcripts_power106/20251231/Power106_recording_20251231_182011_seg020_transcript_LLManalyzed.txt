20251231 182011 Conditions were a little bit challenging at certain points of the day because, you know, wind changes affect the way the waves break and there were a lot of squalls passing through on the day. So we had heavy winds and then the wind would die down for a bit and then get heavier again. So as a surfer, you know, we are used to having to adapt to these conditions and change using conditions. So it wasn't really much of a challenge in that aspect. So I would say we had really good conditions. It was consistent. We had good wave size. It was probably four or five feet, which is not big by any measure, but still good enough to produce high performance surfing.
