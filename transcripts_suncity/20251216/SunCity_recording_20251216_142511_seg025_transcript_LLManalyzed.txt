20251216 142511 Come on, I'm doing this all the way up until... All the way up until 2.30. It's all about Raven. Happy cake day to you, Raven. No, man, right now, you know, all messages. If she not hear it on the radio, I'll send it straight to her phone. Yeah man, so everybody send her a message right now. Yeah man, send Riven some strength, send her some love. No, I can't read right now, I don't want to see nobody that texts me. Hey, send a voice note right now, load up Riven. Anyway shit, we're going to find her. Hey, Sun House Riven, happy cake day! Hey, this is our very own Sunhouse Stacius. Hey, we got ourselves Stacius! Hey, this one, it's your birthday. No, we'll play the best one, you know. Oh, there you are.
