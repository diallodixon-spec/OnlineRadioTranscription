20251215 212210 Whatever I said, whatever I did, I didn't mean it I just want you back for good See, I want you back for girl And whenever I'm gone, send me the song, I'll sing it You'll be right up on the search See, I want to back for girl I'm well, but I'm blind I think that I can stop it Wasn't good But in the corner of my mind I celebrated glory But that wasn't to be But in the twist of separation, you exited when you're free Then to find a little room inside for me
