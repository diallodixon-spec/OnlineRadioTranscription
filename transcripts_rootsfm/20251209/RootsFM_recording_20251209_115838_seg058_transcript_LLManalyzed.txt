============================================================

You can't hide them deceitful hearts, know them touch dirty From them no clean and pure, we a cut them off Chop them up early, smile up in your face, and take this grace, we know them are dirty See my friends turn enemy, I a stay far No length, no bar, no link no bar I said fear, God! I don't have so much time, man. I don't have to make up. Help, I don't mean no.
