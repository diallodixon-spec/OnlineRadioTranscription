Father Gooden. He he used to play down the pier, and then he used to work at a place called Kelvinator. I'd go and treat my father. I'd see him every day. He'd say, you need to do something, but we'd know the manager. And the manager'd say... And some name you call this. You'd say Kelvinator. Yeah, so I'd go down there and learn the full shredder. I'd say, I don't like it, I kind of like it, but I'd play the music scene here. I'd have a friend and we'd go and play a grand play. So said I do like it and I like it, but I play the music. So one day it rained for half a run, three days. I went to the next day and I said whenever it comes I'm going to see the rain. But you know I play the music too.
