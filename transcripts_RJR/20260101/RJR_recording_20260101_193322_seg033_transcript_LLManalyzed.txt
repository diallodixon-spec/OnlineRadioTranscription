20260101 193322 move forward as we have done since independence. Jamaica has overcome countless challenges, and we have never given up, and we must not give up now. Let us stay together, work together, and build a stronger nation together for ourselves, our families, and those who will come after us. May God bless you and bless Jamaica Land. Sir Patrick Allen. With many children now staying with relatives, friends, neighbors or in shelters after the hurricane, we must be extra vigilant. If you suspect any form of violence, abuse or neglect, report it immediately by calling 2-1-1. Let's protect our children, no matter where they are.
