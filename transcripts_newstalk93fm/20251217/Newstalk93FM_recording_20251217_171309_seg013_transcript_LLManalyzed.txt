20251217 171309 Let me down So you better come through this time, please am I crying? Let you down my friend. It was a misunderstanding So if I took it for granted Then I promise from today I go drunk, like I never drunk Waved like I never waved Pined like I never wanted to Just to show you I saw you, I saw you And I need you back in my life Look at people by the truck Emotions running high We are not in the sky Tears running down we eye. Can't you tell that we started? We started. And we need you back and we lie. I need you back, I'm back home. I'm home to me. Come home to me.
