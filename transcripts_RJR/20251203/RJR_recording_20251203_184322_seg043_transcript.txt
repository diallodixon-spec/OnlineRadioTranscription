============================================================

If I'm not careful, I probably could trip over something. The sidewalks are very elevated. Some of them are higher than some. So traveling was definitely difficult, but I found my ways to maneuver. All right. And what was the experience like at Meadowbrook? I was excellent. Probably one of the best two years of my life as far as high school is concerned. I was well accommodated by the teachers and staff, the peers who I interacted with at the time, even now today we're still friends, they made school life very, very joyous for me, you know? Very, very enjoyable for me. I was never left out of anything. I was always included, for example. I remember we would be doing physical education.
