So tell me if you want action Until the lights back on I got the one we could last long I don't even ever know my time Girl, like what I waited for lifelong I pull up in my fashion Every night that shit in any way We can go ahead and just head out And chill up in my villa, take it out the whole night Just just get in the drop top take the head out and cruise with your head outside go ahead it's your time baby it's your time yeah my baby that's the difference when you're my baby that's how it is when you're sitting on top of the world
