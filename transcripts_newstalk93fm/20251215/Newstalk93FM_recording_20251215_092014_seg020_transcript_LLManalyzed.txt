20251215 092014 That's the practice that I know from a boy growing up here in Jamaica. And I know there are many things have changed in Jamaica where we have gotten much more crude, cross, even to each other. But I believe that, you know, we still have a more come of love and so on, one to another. If you notice the social media space, it has become so cross and indeed quite untidy in some case, just the way people communicate with each other. Somebody have a problem with another person and the worst language is being used, you know, dirty and so.
