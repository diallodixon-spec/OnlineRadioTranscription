20260101 194419 I was waiting for so long For a miracle to come Everyone told me to be strong And don't shed a tear Through the darkness and good times I knew I'd make it through And the world thought I had it all But I was waiting for you Hush, now I see light in the sky Oh, it's almost blinding me. I can't believe I've been touched by an angel with love. It's so sweet. Let the rain fall.
