20251216 193322 I'm strong, I'm strong All praises to the most I want Let me tell you about the Life of a queen in a this-year concrete jungle Firm in a regime so you're not gonna see me stop me Mama said no come to town and mix with the Cibongos See, then now me just a-rise and summer rise and summer humble Haunted Christiana, yes, me love go look for mine Never sell me school, me settle down and take me time Do it for the love so naturally the light the shine I really hope you say that I'm strong, I'm strong. I'll resist the most I want. Can I tell you where I'm coming from? Looking back at where the journey begun, I really hope you said that I'm strong.
