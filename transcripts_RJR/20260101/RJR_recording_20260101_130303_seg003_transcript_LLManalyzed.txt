20260101 130303 I love Jamaica, I'm not so loud Them dry clipped wings, somehow we can't fly out But when we day a yard, nothing nice like Jamaica Roast bread, fruit and banana Under the tree, with a glass of lemonade Jump in the river when we're ready for paid No more, I can't buy me out Me no foreign minded, no way to compete We want to visit Jamaica. Jamaica. We want to see that one. This is of Jamaica. Jamaica.
