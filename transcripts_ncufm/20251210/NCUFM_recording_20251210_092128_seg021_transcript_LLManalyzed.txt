So let's make this promise. We will not fair the casting away. We will not idolize the will not idolize the keeping. We will not. And we will trust that every change is a structural way. Every change is a doorway. We will walk against the change with open hands, walking, ready to release, open hands to Jesus is good. Honor it. The promise to let go when God says, Catasect away.
