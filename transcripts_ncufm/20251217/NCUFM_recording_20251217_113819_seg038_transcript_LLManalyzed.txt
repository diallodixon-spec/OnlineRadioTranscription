20251217 113819 So NCUFM is having a Share the Light initiative to celebrate our 15th anniversary. Joining us is Mrs. Toni McLean to tell us more about it. Welcome, Toni. Hi, how are you? I'm well. How are you? A little under the weather, getting the sniffles or recovering from the sniffles, but I'm excited. I hope you were listening to Lifestyle Check yesterday. We talked about the cold and flu. So I need to implement some of the things I heard. Yes, you definitely do. Yes. All, what is the Share the Light initiative? Alright, so the Share in the Light initiative, we actually had our first leg of it for our anniversary. It was our way of giving back to the West following Hurricane Melissa.
