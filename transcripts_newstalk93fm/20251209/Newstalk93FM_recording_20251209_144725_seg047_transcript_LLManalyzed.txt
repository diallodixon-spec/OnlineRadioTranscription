============================================================

I don't need nothing from you Your beautiful autism use I've been reckless with my choices Can't seem to get what the point is Life can be rough, can be smooth And not every fact is the truth Advancing, I playing down my burden. Can't, I'll take the liberty. And I'm gonna love you specially, oh. All the love, all the care, then they fade gone. Don't be hard, baby, give it, I'm gonna love it.
