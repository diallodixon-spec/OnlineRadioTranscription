20251226 135423 Remember, each song can play one time. The voice of Taylor Lanesipper, the party load My head a spinna, so I'm ready for party crowd Take all the shades, I'm a higher, I can't see, bro That gal a skinny ass, she have up a thousand pound I prolly pretty pretty, but me no know for sure Me say she bust a bottle wine, she hold me close Better relax a man, we ain't up without no clothes When me see a little shape in the mirror, I say Jesus Christ. Transform, feel me like a demon child. I take a shot of the C-Roc and I start to cloud. The DG, a player, skipper, the party lord.
