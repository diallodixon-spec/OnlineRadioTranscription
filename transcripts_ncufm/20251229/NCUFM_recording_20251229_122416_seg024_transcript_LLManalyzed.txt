20251229 122416 Yours A heart like yours Sometimes, rains are going to come. Clouds will gather on the horizon. Blue will fade from the sky above. Sometimes, plans will be disrupted. Life will take a turn. Hope will seem less than wishful thinking. Sometimes, bad news will arrive. And we will weep. And we will wonder. Sometimes we'll get angry. We'll shout with the question, why? And in those sometimes, God is here. God understands. God extends a plan to take care of you, not abandon you. Give you the future you hope for.
