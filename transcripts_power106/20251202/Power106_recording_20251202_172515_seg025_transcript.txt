So I just wanted you to share some of what type of information it is that I traffic crash is being recorded in the black box. The United States of America government has put in a new rule that by 2026, 2027, it should be 20 seconds worth of data. So more time will be coming to see what a driver is doing in the last 20 seconds of a crash. That's a lot of time, right? Data you can get is speed data. How fast was this driver driving over the last five seconds before the collision? Was he on the brake pedal or off the brake pedal? Was he turning?
