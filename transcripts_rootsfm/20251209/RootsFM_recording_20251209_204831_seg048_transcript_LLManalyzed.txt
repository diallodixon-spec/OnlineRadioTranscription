============================================================

I want to hear your glass, and the girls will come real quick. It's better than any alcohol or apodiciac. A couple of sips of this love potion, and she'll be on your lap. So I gave some to my dog, when he began to beg. And then he licked his bowl, and he looked at me, and did a wild thing on my leg. He used to scratch and bite me, before he was much, much meaner. But now all the pooters run to my house for the funky, cold Medina. You know what I'm sayin'? I got every dog in my neighborhood breakin' down my door. I got Spuds and Kenzie, Alex from Strolls. They won't leave my dog alone with that Medina, pal. I went out to this girl. She said, hi, my name is Senena. I thought she'd be good to go with a little funky cold medina. She said I'd like a drink. I said, hum, OK, I'll go get it. And then a couple of sips. She cold licked the lips, and I knew that she was with it. So I took her out to my crib.
