20251226 131510 I tell you, I love whenever you bring a vibe With your hands them up in the sky Watch me drunk and having a time Carnival time again And we have all money to spend And we go right down to the end Watch me with me cannibal friend them, them me cannibal friend, friend, friend, yeah. Now I'm the carnival friend. Until we meet up again. When we meet, meet, meet. Rumble, beat, beat, beat. Things so sweet, sweet, sweet. Feel complete, cause we love you back there now. Beat, beat, rumble, beat.
