Parton to continue what is to be done right and for those who made it home safely We say top of the evening to you and you couldn't wait as they get in you turn the radio on And you start to do what you need to do or whatever you have to do But you've got to have your radio on to make certain that you could hear what's happening right here with us inside the nightcap Well, you all know by now now, Jimmy Cliff passed away today. Very wonderful person. Met him quite a few times well. We chit-chat way back in the days in Montego Bay. Trust me, man. Awesome brother, indeed. Tell you what, we got some Jimmy Cliff flavors later on, but it's not with me right now, later on inside the second half of the program. So stay tuned for that later on down for sure. But in the meantime, let's get this part of it started. Once again, as we kick things off right here. My DJ, Donovan Dacus.
