20260102 132016 I'm still above the ground. How'd you guide my hands to write down all them tunes? With negativity we don't grow, oh no. Me family, you don't know the orders. Humble and hold me quarters. Not out unless me have some interviews or some performance. You to run with paper honors and kick back from the corners. But now me hate me keepers with me books in my pajamas. To preach is more my drama. Love peace and keep it calmer. Right now me rather people know to be a better father. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
