20251224 141409 Give it up! I'm telling the lie You don't want no man to come make you cry This is where you are Attention, girls, and the things that you think you can do so right If you would ring from your finger park, you're like yarr I run back a DJ like give a star Anytime you're talking, maf, you done it in a war All them things they make, who knew a drift was so far She a smarty-picky too, you know, have a sister too Every night, every day, she a baller where she do to you Love and respect, every time that she get to you And when you're down and up, she always sit to you. Here we go. Loneliness is taking over. I don't see she's on the pillar.
