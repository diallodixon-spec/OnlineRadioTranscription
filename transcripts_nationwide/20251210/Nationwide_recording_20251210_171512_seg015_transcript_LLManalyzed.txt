Power has been restored to key tourism corridors including Montego Bay and the Elegant Corridor in St. James, Norman Manley Boulevard and the West End in Negril, Falmouth Town and Pier in Trelawny, and the Ocherias Cruise Ship Pier and Duns River in St. Anne. Overall, JPS says approximately 83% of its customers island-wide now have electricity. Mr. Grant has credited the achievement to continuous work by JPS teams and overseas support crews, along with coordination with municipal emergency operations centers. He is also expressing appreciation to the additional line workers from Jamaica, the wider Caribbean and North America. As restoration enters its most difficult phase, Mr. Grant says the company's focus will now shift to rebuilding the network in the worst-affected Western parishes and continuing efforts to safely reconnect as many customers as possible.
