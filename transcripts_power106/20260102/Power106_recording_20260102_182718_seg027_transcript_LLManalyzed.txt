20260102 182718 went to Real Madrid and he's now going on loan to Leon because there's no space for him to get a game at Real Madrid. So Estevan of Chelsea, who I think is the best thing that Brazilian football has produced since Neymar, he has chosen Chelsea and what a start he's made. He's already an absolute hero. I know the Chelsea fans have a song all about him to the tune of KC and the Sunshine Band. I like it. I like it too. It's wonderful watching him. He's 18. He scored five goals for Brazil between September and November. It took Vinicius Junior a long, long time to get to five goals for Brazil. Estevan looks like he's been there his entire life. He really is a special talent. In terms of Brazil now, what are you seeing now? Have they accepted the fact that the coach is who is going to be taking the team to the World Cup?
