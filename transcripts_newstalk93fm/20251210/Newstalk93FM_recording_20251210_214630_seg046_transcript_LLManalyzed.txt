And although it's over We'll always be there We only have a couple minutes Yes, we're going back to real life I guess we found a silver lining I'm glad you're doing so well. If only you could see how I've been. If I'm being real, no, it ain't been the same. We could talk if we want. I already know it's no good for me. It's all right. I think I'm fine with the silence. There's some good and goodbyes. Oh, I'm back on your sofa. Of course, I still care. And love's never wasted.
