20251231 093925 And I have nothing left To take one more breath When I'm gasping for air To know you're there Even in my weakness here I'm learning that your strength is measured out each day Not stirred up for the future but given fresh today In this way you keep me dependent on your grace Face to face with you each morning's new embrace your mercies are new every morning here. Great is your faithfulness to me, I see. The daily bread includes the strength I need. Deuteronomy 33 and 25.
