advise our consumers that if they are having family gatherings, I know many of us, we love to go back for more and more and a little bit more. And regardless of the little bit more that we have gone for, there's always leftovers, right? Because we have to have our Christmas dinner extending two, sometimes three days. I want to say to our consumers that if it is that you intend to put up your leftovers as much as is possible, please take up the food within two hours so that it does not get bacteria in it and end up hurting your stomach. And most foods can actually be frozen as opposed to just refrigerated and you defrost them afterwards. You'd be so surprised. Exactly.
