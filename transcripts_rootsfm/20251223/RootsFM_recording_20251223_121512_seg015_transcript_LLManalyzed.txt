20251223 121512 Give up, man. Remember, families that are out there that don't have it. For me, Sister Isis, if I had the power, I don't think people should be decking or doing anything right now. Go out and reach those that are hurting because Apostle V.T. Williams always says, when one man beard catches fire, wait yours. We don't know when it will be overturned. So much love, Sister Isis, and to the Roots family. Thank you. Much love and celebrate Christ. For sure. The reason of the season. God bless you. Stay safe. And I think you'll be on next Tuesday. Yes, I will be on. I dropped the gun a moment ago, but you'll be here next Tuesday once, if God will. Blessings all the way.
