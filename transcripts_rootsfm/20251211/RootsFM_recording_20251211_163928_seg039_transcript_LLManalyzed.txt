2025-12-11 23:41:14 That I don't love you you're at the top of my list cause I'm always thinking of you I still remember in the days when I was scared to touch you How I spent my day dreaming, planning how to say I love you You must have known that I had feelings deep enough to swim in That's when you opened up your heart and you told me to come in Oh my love A thousand kisses from you is never enough I just don't wanna stop Oh Never too much, never too much
