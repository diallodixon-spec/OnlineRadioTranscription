20251226 182212 You're good, good, send me to my own work. And come back and you're better ready to split. Sit down, sit down, go, go, girl. Wind up nobody, wind up, oh, girl. Firm, firm, you know what we're doing, jerk. Go your pants up and we'll see if you like to work. Go repeat, bread up in your church. And if I get with that, it hurt. Sanctify, no drunk or can't purge. You're an angel, if you're an angel, you're a pervert. If I get one, one. Know it. One, you're gone. gun, get another quick kick Don't listen to lamb chirp chirp Green as a deer, fire as in a skirt skirt Say you're bad, and you're bad, I can't see you with a script Every day, every great charge I'm with you, you're choppa gate, hachi I'm one of the saints of the latter-day church Get in the spirit, with the spirit, dinner back with where you're drinking Take her in the seat, it have a limit Drink, bring me with you, I'll cook every minute And baby, I don't want to see you fall in love. If you don't make of your mother or your cousin.
