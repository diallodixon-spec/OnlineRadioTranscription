20251222 121413 Billy, why are you dressed up like an ant? Because there are ants in the driveway, and I need to tell them that they need to move before dad comes home and drives over them. Why don't you just pick them up and move them? Because there's too many. Why don't just sweep them out of the way? Because it'll hurt them. Why aren't you just squirt them away with water? I tried that, but they just came back. So why are you dressed up like an ant? Because I want to be like Jesus. Jesus? He didn't dress up like an ant. Yeah, but he became a baby and grew up and told us that he loves us and that we need him. When did he do that? At Christmas time. Oh, yeah. So I'm going to become an aunt and tell them that they have to move before Dad comes home. Can I help? Yeah, you go get Dad's headphones and McClure's and Spring's on for him. That is. OK, then what? Then you go tell them that I'm coming, and then. Hi, kids. I'm home.
