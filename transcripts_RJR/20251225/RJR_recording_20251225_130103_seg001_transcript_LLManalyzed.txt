20251225 130103 I don't want a lot for Christmas There is just one thing I need I don't care about the presents underneath the Christmas tree. I just want you for my own, more than you could ever know. Make my wish come true. All I want for Christmas is you, you, you. I don't want a lot for Christmas. There is just one thing I need. I don't care.
