20251225 090002 I'm just holding your hand We're gliding along with the song of a wintry fairyland Our cheeks are nice and rosy and comfy, cozy all week We're snuggled up together like the birds of a feather would be Let's dance around the forest and sing the chorus all too Come on, it's lovely when the boys stay right together with you There's a birthday party at the old farmer's grave It'll be the perfect ending of a perfect day We'll be singing the songs we love to sing Without a single stop At the fireplace while we watch the chestnut bop Bop bop bop There's a happy feeling nothing in the world can cry When they pass around the coffee and the pumpkin pie But we'll never do like a picture friend Like our rearing eyes These wonderful things are the things we'll remember all through our lives. Just hear the sleigh bells jingle and ring, jingle and toot. Come on, it's lovely when the sleigh bells ring.
