Come on clap your hands like this All right, y'all ready feel it like my strength is gone with no friends to call my own and no one to call on the phone I will lift my hand and call his precious name cause he's always been there and his promise he never changed yeah, screaming down my face I put on the garment of praise cause my ways are not his ways and my thoughts can too fade away I will sing the song of the Lord I will praise you even more I will bless you The one I'm living for I will bless you You're the one I adore I will bless you On Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday I will bless you Thursday, Friday, Saturday I will bless you
