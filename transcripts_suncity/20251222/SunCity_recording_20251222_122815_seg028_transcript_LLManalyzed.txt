20251222 122815 Sweet love, and my mind is so confusing. Who would be the special one? Every day I'm trying to find you All the run I've got to know Is there a place for me? I know you haven't given me names And a message very clear All it takes is time and patience to bring it near. But who could mean? Tell me, who can I run to to share this empty space?
