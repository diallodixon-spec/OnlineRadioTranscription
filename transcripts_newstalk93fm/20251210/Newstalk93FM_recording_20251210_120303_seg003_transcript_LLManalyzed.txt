That's what I want, that's what I want There are no hard feelings if you only want to act like babies too For a night or two And sometimes in the morning go back to being someone you never knew You never knew Baby don't you worry You ain't gonna hurt me tonight It won't be the worst thing If this is how it is Then she kissed me again And said you don't want this heart Boy, it's already every time she touched, it just goes up in smoke Only stay a couple nights, then she gon' be gone I said, baby, you should know that's what I want She said, you don't want this hurt, boy, it can't be fixed
