20251222 211613 feel me with such melodies, whoa, oh, my sweet motivation, yeah. When you speak to me, I hear a song. Every word you say feels like a poem. I will take you with me everywhere, listen to you every day. Why are you my steel inspiration? I never want to say goodbye. This love that I'm feeling gives me life. On top of a lake, I run away, training the night. I don't even want to go to sleep. I won't take a break. This symphony is so real. It's so real. When you speak to me, I hear a song. Memory word you say.
