Keep a laughin' up your eyes, all we need is love All we need is a love, love, love Say help your sister out, and help your brother know You better use your strength before he gets one Another member say we stand in unison We fall in division, it's so much power in community So if you ever fall, I'll pick you up, then I'll lift you up You can count on me, no way I can be gone to say alright, yeah Big we live in peace All we did is love, all we did is love
