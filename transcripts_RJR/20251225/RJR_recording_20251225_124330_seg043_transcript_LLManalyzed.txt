20251225 124330 Someday at Christmas there'll be no tears With all men are equal and all men have fears One shiny moment, one proud way from our world today Someday all our dreams will come to be Someday, the world will be our free Maybe not in time for you and me But someday, at Christmastime Someday, at Christmas, the rain will not fail Hey, the moon will be gone and love will prevail Someday, a new world that we can start with hope in every heart.
