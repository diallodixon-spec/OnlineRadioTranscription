20251217 163220 kilogram and velocities meters per second be SI uniform momentum would be kilograms per meters per second Okay kilograms per meter per second. Okay, we can work with that. We can work with that So then let me throw Let me throw a quick one at you So a ball of mass that is a two kilograms is moving at a velocity at 5 meters per second What would its momentum be? So since you said that it's 2 kilograms as the mass of the object and it's moving at 5 meters per Second that's going to be 2 times 5 so that's 10 and Kilogram meters per second would be the unit. So it's 10 kilograms per meters per seconds. Okay, alright. I think I'm grasping the concept now. So then, can you explain why
