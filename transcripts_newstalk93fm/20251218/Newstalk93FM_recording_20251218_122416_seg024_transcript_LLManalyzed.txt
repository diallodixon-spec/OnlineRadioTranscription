20251218 122416 You come alive with one wine, baby With you I want to dance the night away One jam's in a lifetime, baby So don't feel away You don't like the fast life But look on the bright side, girl I go take the blame I just want want you come and bite it up Just a little winding up Come and meet me behind the truck and we rev it up Whole day, keep throwing it back at the way you stop Baby no way, we could post up all the pictures you want When you're ready, I go over, darling, you go over there But we compete in the middle and start a bacchanal Play in the middle, hey, what we gon' do now? Jam to a rhythm in the heat, I can't evolve but in the heat, hey What we gon' do know? Start a wine on it, I say compromise on it
