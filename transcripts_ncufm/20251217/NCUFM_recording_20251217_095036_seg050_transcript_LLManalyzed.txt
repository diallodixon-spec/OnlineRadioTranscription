20251217 095036 part of me loves the world and the other loves you so what do i do i want to be saved but i gotta stay cool too and no i'm not a fool i know eventually i'm gonna have to choose and really i don't want to lose my ticket in the heaven and a chance to be used by you and if it's god that i'm after i just can't serve two masters and before something happens i gotta turn it all around because i know i can't just have my cake and eat it too because it's really easy to stay on the fence and still do you And it'd be cool if we could love the Lord and still go do our thing But see, it doesn't work like that You gotta be white or black
