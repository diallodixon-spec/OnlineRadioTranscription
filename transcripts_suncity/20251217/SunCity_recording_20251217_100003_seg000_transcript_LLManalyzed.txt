20251217 100003 and talking on our behalf in the spiritual realm. So we are assured so above and so below that we are protected in our work and it's time that we stop being tired and stop being restless. There's no need to be restless and there's no need to lack courage because we have people who are fighting on our behalf in their ancestral realm. And that is what keeps me going. And I'm looking forward as I come forward to celebrate my Earth Strong in January, to be there in Sun City and to really give a master class on Africology. That is my prayer and I hope Sun City will be able to host a master class on Africology and what it means when we talk about strong institutions. Okay. Thank you so much, Dr. Ashantiwa. Thank you to everybody on the line.
