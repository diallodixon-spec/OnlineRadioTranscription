You know, in these times when the world is full of nothing but wars and lies and crimes and hatred and modernization becomes the mother of civilization Nations turning against nations We need to stop, look around, pause There is a light, a light of love A light to keep nations together as one And if we are one step ahead, then we know we're out. And if we're one step behind, we know we're down. So you see, we've got to be right there! Right there! See? One step ahead and you're up!
