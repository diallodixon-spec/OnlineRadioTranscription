20251225 193929 Said I'm falling, falling, I'm falling As I lay my bed with my head to the ceiling Say I'm drowning alone and I'm lost in my feelings Somebody send me a sign cause you know that I need it Can Carnival coming back to me cause you know you're my healing. I said it's okay, it's my time I pay, time I pay, my time I pay.
