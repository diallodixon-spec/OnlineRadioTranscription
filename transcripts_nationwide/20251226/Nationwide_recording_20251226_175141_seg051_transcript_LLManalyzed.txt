20251226 175141 If there's anything you need All you have to do is say Don't you satisfy everything in me We shouldn't waste a single day So don't stop me falling It's destiny holding a power I just can't deny It's never changing Can't you hear me? I'm saying I want you for the rest of my life Together forever and ever too fast Together forever with you And don't you know I would move heaven and earth To be together forever with you
