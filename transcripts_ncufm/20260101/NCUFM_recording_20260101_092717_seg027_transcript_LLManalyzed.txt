20260101 092717 So many doors So many ways So many times You've been better, you've been better So many doors I keep beginning to count the ways You've healed me, you've blessed me Forever and ever You've been better than good to me Oh I should have lost my mind a long time ago You've been better I have to give you all the glory today When I think of the goodness of Jesus I have to say You've been better You've been better
