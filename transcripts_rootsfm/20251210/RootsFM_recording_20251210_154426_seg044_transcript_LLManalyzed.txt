I know He's here to save on tomorrow It's possible, but I doubt it His kiss is credits in the bag of love I'd never leave one without it He is different from anyone I know, that is supreme. Bedroom eyes, head back to the side. Please, don't be so mean. Voice it out, I love you. I'm hot, you love me hot. We make love time, it's all forever. It's not so bad if I love you. I won't leave you never. I've got to, got to tell you, darling. Ooh, baby, I, I love you from head to toe.
