Good afternoon and welcome to your lunchtime sports report, I'm Denise Walters. We kick things off with football. Mount Pleasant FA will look to secure their first hold on the Concacaf Caribbean Cup when they face off with Universidad O&M FC of the Dominican Republic in the second leg final at the National Stadium this evening at seven. Mount Pleasant are currently holding a one-nil lead on aggregate from the first leg final in the Domrep last week. Now, although holding that slender lead, head coach Theodore a two goal advantage. I think one is enough so we know that we have something to play for. We've been mean in terms of giving up goals in this tournament so far and we want to continue that way.
