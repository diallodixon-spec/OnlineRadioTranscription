And some nights, you're carved in ice. Some some night you're like nothing i've ever seen before oh we're looking maybe i'm crazy oh it's crazy and it's true i know you can see me no one else can save me now but you as long long as the planets are burning, as long as the stars are burning. As long as your dreams are coming true, you better believe it, that I would do anything for you.
