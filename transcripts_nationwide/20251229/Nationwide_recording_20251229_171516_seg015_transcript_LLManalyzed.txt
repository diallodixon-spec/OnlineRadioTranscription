20251229 171516 Attention motorists, it's time to switch to the T-Tag on Trans Jam Highways. Our automated T-Tag lanes reduce the cost of managing cash at our toll plazas, and drivers of class 1 and 2 vehicles who use the T-tag pay a lower toll fare than those who use the manually operated toll booths. They also get their 10th trip through any toll plaza free. The T-Tag makes it quicker, more cost efficient, and safer for our customers. T-Tag packages are discounted by 50% down to $1,250 including a $500 toll credit from December 8, 2025 until January 2, 2026. This makes no sense people. Why waste time in the manual lane when you can't just breeze through the T-Tag lane? Plus you pay a lower toll rate in the T-tag lane. You can easily get your T-Tag from any toll collector. Just have to remember to top up by adding funds on the My T-Tag app or by WhatsApp. Drive like the winner you deserve to be with the T-Tag.
