20251219 152313 you want to share with the listeners before you go? I'm looking forward to everyone's support. It's a good cause. So, you know, please come out. Anything that you can do would be appreciated. Thank you so much. Business Development Manager at Future Energy Source Company Limited, Fesco Howard Cox. So you heard it. Every mickle, make a muckle. We're not asking you want to fold a burial. What we're asking you to do. Hello, my darling. What we asking you to do is just to contribute what you can. I see my wonderful friend standing there. When I go through that door, when I come out, just go through the next door, a tin of corn, beef, anything, and we drop it into the barrel because we're sending it down to the west. Our children are important and that's who we're trying to make a difference in their life. There's a wonderful hello. Thank you so much. May god bless you. Couldn't come out of the vehicle but gave us a nice contribution that you know
