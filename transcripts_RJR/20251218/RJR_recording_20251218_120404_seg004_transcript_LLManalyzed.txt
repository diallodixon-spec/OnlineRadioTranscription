20251218 120404 Office of the Jamaica Public Service Company, Hugh Grant, has declined to address questions surrounding the additional funding that will be needed to restore service to customers. The government has loaned the JPS 150 million US of the 350 million US dollars it said it required for full restoration. The opposition has questioned whether the JPS will be able to secure funding for the balance of US 200 million. But speaking with the media at the Sangster International Airport in St James last evening, Mr. Grant said the focus at this time is on the restoration of electricity to communities. At this time, we're focused on resources coming in and safely executing on the restoration. I'm not going to go ahead and speak to funding at this time. Mr. Grant and Energy Minister Daryl Vaz are at the airport to welcome a team of 117 electrical linesmen from Canada. The linesmen will bolster the efforts to restore electricity in western parishes.
