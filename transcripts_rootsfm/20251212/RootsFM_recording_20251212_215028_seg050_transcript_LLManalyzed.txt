20251212 215028 I have my house and I have my car. I have my drink and I have my bar. I have my peace and I don't want war. I have my riches, I don't need bar. Got my money, I got my girl. Got my diamonds, I got my pearls. Got my things and I got my wings. I fly every day, we are the lord of wings. Everybody sing! Happiness! We're not in another wish list. We're not fake friends, we're not bad minds, we don't want no friendship from them. Sing again now! Happiness! We are in another wish list! Dance me a dance and I enjoy myself, if you go deeper. Let's go deeper.
