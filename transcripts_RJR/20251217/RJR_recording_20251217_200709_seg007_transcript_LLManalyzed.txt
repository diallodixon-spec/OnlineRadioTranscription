20251217 200709 What a crazy time. New York is the life in the city can be so hard But after dark, new energy finds me I light up the night and live like a star In the evening, the real me comes alive I can feel it, in the evening, the real me comes alive. I can feel it. In the evening, something happens that I can't describe. But it helps me to survive. It's like magic, like something in the air. You can feel it.
