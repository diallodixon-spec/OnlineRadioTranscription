Most of the politicians that were elected in those areas, they do not understand it. They do not understand the parish. I believe that people like Mr. Hazan and Mr. Darling should have done better with farming in those area. I remember in the 80s. So who's there now? Mr. Morgan or who else again? Who's the other one? No, I'm not talking Mr. Morgan. No, I am talking him. And so what about him now and the other one? Yeah, because in North Central, they doesn't produce a lot of lettuce and tomatoes and stuff. Who is the other MP? Who is the MP that replaced, that is in the seat that Horace Dally used to occupy? I think it's a guy named Wavell Hines. Alright, it's Wavell just coming into.
