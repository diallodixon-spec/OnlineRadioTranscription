Just trying to make things work You've had enough Of battles you fight against your will Keep showing up And one day I know you're bound to end When you've been so strong for so long And all you can do is hold on Just when it seems like there's no way Here comes a brighter day, here comes a brighter day Hurting so deep it's feeling like I need rum and wheat to feel alive Burnt out and deep and sleep deprived, oh god please keep me through this
