You a climb up in a age now so you high risk for sugar, high blood pressure and other things that can affect you and your baby even before her time for the clothes, pampers crib. You try your best to go to a clinic early and go get your check up. You hear me Diana? Once a baby business, clinic is a must and a healthy body is a must. Healthy baby, healthy you. It's easy to learn what to do. A message from the Ministry of Health
