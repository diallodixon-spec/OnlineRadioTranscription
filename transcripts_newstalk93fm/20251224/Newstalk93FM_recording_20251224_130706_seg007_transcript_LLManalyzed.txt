20251224 130706 We rock your party with a thousand rag, thousand flag, thousand rag, thousand rag Thousand gal, thousand man, jump up like a thousand man Everybody jump and wave, show me your thousand hand, just show me your thousand We come to have your party jumping by the thousand Rock by the thousand, towel by the thousand Flag by the thousand, running by the thousand Winding by the thousand, climbing by the thousand Running by the thousand My mother didn't buy me a green or did a sneaker She never know she buy legacy, I never know either All I know I see is super blue, climbing on a stake And tell all me little friend and them, I want to repeat that. The opportunity come up on me and let it fly past. A colored flavor road, Maturita road, and it bypassed. When we raised the venue, Lord, this was only dry grass. Peaks without a white flag. I start to wave it like a soldier on the floor.
