Remember, we assess ADPEM and every group based on hurricanes, right? Hurricanes give you warnings, give you times to prepare, give you time to go clean the sandy gully, which give you all this time, right? And then we have to grade you, yeah? And I won't even give a grade. No. And then you're prepared for earthquake? No. Which gives you no warning. How it sounds like I see you struggling to ride a bicycle and then you ask me, can you loan me your car? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, man. AdPem is giving people assurance. I'm fascinated. Is it the same assurance I know about earthquakes? About earthquakes. Which gives you no warning.
