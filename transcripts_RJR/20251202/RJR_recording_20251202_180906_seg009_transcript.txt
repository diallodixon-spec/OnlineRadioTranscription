Radio Jamaica, active for the good of our nation. After the hurricane, children may experience emotional distress caused by fear, exhaustion, or hunger. Stay calm, listen, and help them understand what they're feeling. Try to meet their basic needs. Give them food, water, rest, and reassurance. Help them relax with simple breathing exercises or by reading their favorite story. Time, attention and a warm hug are your best tools. Let your child know that their reactions are normal and that many other children feel the same way. A message brought to you by UNICEF. And if you buy a vehicle in the promotional period, you will also get a chance to pull from the Santa bag in the showroom for an extra holiday surprise.
