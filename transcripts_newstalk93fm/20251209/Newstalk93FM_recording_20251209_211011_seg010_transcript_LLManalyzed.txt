I know you're not easy. Long time I've been waiting for you. I have something for you. When it's time to leave in the morning. And you feel for somebody. You could come and look for me me If you want a jam, well then call me I'll sell off off the DJ On the end of the party Cause when she look and she tell me She tell me Dias baby Take back a Dias honey Talk back a Dias baby So you know me ease up the tension A Dias baby Push back a Dias, honey Say she love just so what does hold it?
