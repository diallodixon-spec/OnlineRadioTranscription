============================================================

You know it's not the best day, baby. I love you. You know, you know I do. You know I want you forever. And always in my heart. Here's what could be sweeter. You think the same for me. Say you'll ever be always there for me. Announcing now to the world that you and you alone are my pride and joy, my heart and soul, my rhyme and song, my rhyme, my wrong. And once again, all aboard on our crazy days. Hey, I see your face, and all that stress is history. And oh, I'm afraid.
