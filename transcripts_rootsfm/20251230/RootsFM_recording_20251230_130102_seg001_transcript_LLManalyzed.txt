20251230 130102 It's time to set the stage and go back up the stage right away. Just bring your wings and take flight. I don't know how much time I'll be able to approach them and help you out. For the part you've been wishing, I'll tell you about every time. That's how people look for you, watch out for your past remarks. And if you're down in any desperate food, don't pass the mark. Don't forget to give a fuck about what's stuck in the past. That's how you're going to pick a budget for everybody in class. In my mind, so tell him I don't need to grow so soft. Thank you for watching!
