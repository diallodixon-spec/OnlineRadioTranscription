2025-12-12 02:07:43 I look back on all those good times we once shared And I must have been blind just to think I'd find someone new One who'd love me better than you Well, it may come as a surprise Loneliness has opened my eyes I tried every love I could find Still I can't get you out of my mind Cause there's no one in the world
