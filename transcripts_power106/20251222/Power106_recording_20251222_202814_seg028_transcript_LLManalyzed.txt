20251222 202814 I'll be lonely, I know I'll be blue Yet I'd rather to be lonely than to have a love that's untrue Most people learn by mistake, so they say But I don't want to learn that way, cause it's a hard way Call me anything you want to I couldn't be less my friend I'm feeling the same in myself From the things that I fear I'll be lonely I know, I know I'll be blue Yet I'd rather to be lonely than to have a lovely sunshine
