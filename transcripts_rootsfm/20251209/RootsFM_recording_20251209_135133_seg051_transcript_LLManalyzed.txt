============================================================

She's mine Don't waste your time I love you for being here. Take you anywhere. But I love you endlessly. Love you with my share. So come and go with me to one town. But we both cannot have a home inside one or the other. And one day you'll discover that you're my girl forever. I know she'll tell you I'm the one for her, cuz she said I'd blow my mind
