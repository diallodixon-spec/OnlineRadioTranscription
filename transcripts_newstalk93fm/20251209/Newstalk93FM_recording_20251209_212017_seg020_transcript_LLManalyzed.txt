Show me your thousand and We come to have your body jumping by the thousand Rock by the thousand Towel by the thousand Flag by the thousand Running by the thousand Winding by the thousand Climbing by the thousand Burning by the thousand My mother didn't buy me a green or did a sneaker She never know she buy legacy I never know either All I know I say super blue Climbingade. Can't tell all me little friend and them. I want to repeat that. The opportunity come up on me and let it fly past. A colored cleaver road, Maturita road, and then bypassed. When we received your new lawn, this was only dry grass. Peaks pulled out a white flag. I start to wave it like a thousand rag. Thousand flag, thousand flag, thousand rag, thousand flag. Thousand gal, thousand man. Champagne in a thousand man. Everybody jump and wave and throw in a thousand. And you should not see this big man. You coulda swear once people jumping by the thousand. Flag by the thousand. Rock by the thousand. Towel by the thousand. People running by the thousand. Raining by the thousand. Climbing by the thousand.
