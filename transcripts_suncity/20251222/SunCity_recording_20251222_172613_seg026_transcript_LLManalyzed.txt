20251222 172613 The girl used to be lonely Yeah, baby, more and more, oh, yeah The girl that says rewind Monday One month ago today I was happy as a lot But now I go for walks To the movies, maybe to the park I have a seat on the same old bench To watch the children play. You know tomorrow is their future, but for me just another day. They all gather round me and they seem to know my name.
