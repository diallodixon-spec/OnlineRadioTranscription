Come on, man, you must know somebody who can... And you said 12 o'clock. Right, and to avoid any kind of confusion because when people say 12 o'clock because they have analog clock. So even my analog clock is set to 24 hours. So there's no confusion whatsoever. So you're talking about 1200 hours of military time. That's it. Can we say, can we just say, deadline 11.30 a.m. That's not good. No, 11.59. 11.59, that's not good, yes.
