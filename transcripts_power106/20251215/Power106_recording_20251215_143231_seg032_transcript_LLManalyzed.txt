20251215 143231 Let's now welcome for the first time for this week of Land Solutions, Attorney-at-law, Gloria Brown. Thank you so much, Jesse and the team. Good afternoon, listeners. Welcome again to Land Solutions. Thank you for joining me on this Advent, in this season of Advent as we approach Christmas and I pray that all is well. I know persons are going through their struggles, many people in the West still without proper accommodation, still having challenges, but it's in such a time that Jesus came. You know, the Prince of Peace, in such a time of chaos and confusion. That was the time in which he came. Time of census, time when persons were dislocated, traveling all over the world.
