============================================================

Spending every dime to keep you talking on the line That's how it was And all those walks together Out in any kind of weather Just because There's a brand new way of looking at your life When you know that love is standing by your side This was meant to be. And I'm also glad I found you. I'm so glad that I found you. Gotta have your love around me baby. I'll always stay. Cause I can't go back to living without you.
