20251226 160506 But I will keep on hanging Cause I'm not giving up I'll be fighting for ya Can't believe it's time to leave any Can't you see that I am grieving? One mistake should break us apart Baby please don't crush my heart At nights when I'm ready to lay down my head Can't believe you're not cheering my babyide me Baby come and hide me I'll do just anything for you to come home Cause I can take it on my own I need ya Oh baby I need ya My girl is leaving while I'm living Just can't live without ya But I will keep on hanging cause I'm not giving up I'll be fighting for ya Can't believe it that you're leaving Can't you see that I am grieving One mistake should break us apart
