Promise me this feeling will never end Even when we're old Our love will never get cold In all of the good times We shared together, baby Through every weather, baby Forever Forever you and I. You are the reasons why I can't sleep at night. Oh, baby, you are the seasons that changes with every time. And I love you. Think you are the reason why I can't sleep at night. Oh, baby, you are the season that changes with every time. Oh, baby. You are the reason. All right. Yeah.
