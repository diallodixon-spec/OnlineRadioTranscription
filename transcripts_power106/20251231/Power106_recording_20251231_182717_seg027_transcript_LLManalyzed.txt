20251231 182717 that I go to are just to keep the blade sharp and keep the presence of Jamaican surfing out there. And yeah, I continue to stress the importance of getting young people into the sport out here because there's a lot of opportunity for young people in the sport of surfing in many different areas of the sport. And yeah, so get the kids out there surfing. It's a sport that really impacts a person positively in so many ways and teach people so many good things about life and nature and balance. So yeah, definitely I'm a big advocate for surfing and want to see more people surfing in Jamaica and I want to see the Jamaican people embracing and accepting the sport and supporting us. Yeah man. Okay, we see some champions here, the Wimbledon Spokeman champion at the team. We see Longwell champion either.
