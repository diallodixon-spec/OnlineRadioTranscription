============================================================

My God delivers again. Oh, my God delivers again. You'll see when He sends a call, He loves, He reaches down His hands. That's when all the forces of evil will have to flee at His command. I said you've got all, you've got all man. You are, he's still gone and no finally. Oh father, when things go wrong. When things go wrong. Oh my god, he'll make them right. You'll make them right, father.
