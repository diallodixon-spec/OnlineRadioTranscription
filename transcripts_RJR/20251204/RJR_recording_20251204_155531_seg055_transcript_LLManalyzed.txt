So let me see now. You want to try and make $300,000 and the tool is for 20 grand and the lumber is 10 grand. That's a grand total of 30. And I'm not charging myself. I'm going to figure it out. YouTube, thank you. You know where I'm going to clap? Okay. Who have carpenter problem? Carpenter, plumber, Tyler, Mason. Follow me now. The man who chop the grass. Don't worry yourself. No. I saw one come, I'm going to buy it today. Listen, I have circular, sir. I have jigs, sir. All right. I have tables, sir, I'm not moving. We can't expect a song about carpentry coming our way slowly. While we finish, before I ask you about this song here with Beris, what was that like working with Beris? Alright, first of all, me, I used to put up on the monotone, honestly.
