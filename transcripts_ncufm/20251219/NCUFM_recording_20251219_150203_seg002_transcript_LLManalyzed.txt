20251219 150203 which is expected sometime next year. Okay. What I call this good news, I'm not so sure if I would. I'm somewhere in between because... It depends on explanation for reducing the amount recommended. Right. Right. Because if it's some not scientifically backed explanation and just you being skeptical of vaccines, then is it't for vaccinations, that's the reason why we don't have another, you know, measles or mumps outbreak, you know. In Jamaica,ica yes but it's getting away from them in the u.s because people are not giving their children the measles vaccine so right that i guess it depends on how early they do it yeah but it's still it's still something that i would recommend personally yeah me too
