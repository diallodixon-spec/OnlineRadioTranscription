============================================================

If your heart isn't in it, why can't you tell me so? If my heart wasn't in it, I'd have known long ago. If your heart is in it, why keep me hanging on? Just tell me and I'll be gone from your life You treat me like a stranger As if I was dead Oh baby I'm waiting for a miracle to make you show that you can. Hey, yeah. Your heart is waiting for a while.
