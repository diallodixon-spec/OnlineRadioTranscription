20251215 190709 authorities are under resourced and there should have been things they were able to do but for the lack of resources is concerning. The fact that of course when we have a national threat level here of probable terrorist threat level of probable in this country and have since September yet the resources in the AFP alone where they monitor a lot of these people on watch lists is and as far as back as May last year there was a warning to government that they were under resourced they could not keep an eye on everyone that is incredibly concerning and of course reports that there were certain flags in the car of the alleged perpetrators I think there is a lot to be concerned about here gun law reform which is the government's big response to this goes so far and let's see the detail of that but there's a lot more this government's not doing. We had Peter Moroney on the program yesterday, and you know, he's an ex-copper, and he had a few interesting thoughts on his views on things, and part of it was that we're not able to enough, and this is just a state issue, but not enough cops on the beat. We need more police officers.
