unless you were to ship the item or the agent stand up right there when they inspect it. Listen, Customs' job is to protect the borders, collect revenue and to facilitate trade. They don't collect or store shipment, they inspect it and somebody has to present it for inspection. So how do Customs ever get so much cost in them? Tracy, and the Customs are alone involved in the clearance process process, even though it's them we tend to talk about. Look at it this way, shipment delayed, talk to your airline agent. Missing items, talk to your freight forwarder. The charges surprise you now, call customs. But remember to collect your signed and stamped declaration or C number from your agent. So when you call customs, they can better help you. We're never too old for learning. Some miss know it all. Want when customs roll on your item now. You mean detain it? But that's only for restricted or prohibited items Tracy.
