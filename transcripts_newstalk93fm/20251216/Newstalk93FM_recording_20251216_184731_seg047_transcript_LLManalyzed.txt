20251216 184731 I see you running back to me now That just shine for me And the blessings just afloat You don't show me You don't have no heart Don't have no love for me Better you leave me alone Exit me soon Cause you're too fast I'd rather find a love like ours Searched around but never found the feeling that I needed in my heart
