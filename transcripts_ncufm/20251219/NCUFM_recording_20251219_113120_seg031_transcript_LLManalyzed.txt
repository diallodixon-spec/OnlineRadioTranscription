20251219 113120 Good morning, Captain. I don't normally voice note, but because this is my last Captain log with you, I'm shouting out to tell you all the best on your new journey. Bon voyage. Walk good. Thank you for that short and sweet note, Chellianne. Thank you. Andrea Singh is cruising good morning to you, Andrea. Oh, Elder Errol Isaacs, good morning to you. Glad you're listening to your favorite program. And thank you. Thank you. Thank you so much for your well wishes. Shout out to my grandson, Thiago Jackson, coming from Grandma Tetresia Howitt. I hope I got those right.
