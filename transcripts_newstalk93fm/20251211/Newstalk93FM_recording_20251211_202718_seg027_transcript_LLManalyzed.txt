2025-12-12 14:39:05 you don't have to return about it cause it's crystal clear now now guess it's bye to the good times I'll be gone by the sunrise I'll be better on my own I'll better on my own na na nobody should call my phone nobody should call my home na na this is my last heart last break song. I'll be good on my own. I'll be on my own. Why are you so quick to leave? When we both can make it worse. When I'm gone, I'll make you nervous. If you hurt me, I deserve it. I've been actingly Forgetting what you were You start loving me, I know this But even chaos serves a purpose It feels good to love somebody And somebody loves you back So don't give in to your tears
