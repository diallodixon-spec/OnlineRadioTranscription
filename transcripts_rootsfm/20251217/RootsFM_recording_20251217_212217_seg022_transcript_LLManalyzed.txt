20251217 212217 And I'm not alone You give me hope, hope You're like a sunrise No, I'm not afraid Cause you give me hope When I walk on sinking sand Feeling lonely in a crowd When everything's pulling me in every direction You're my anchor, you're my solid ground All I'm searching for a fight Your medicine for my mind You give me hope You're like the morning sun I'm not alone You give me hope
