20251215 143521 I love that song and I love that song. Heavenly Fathers, help us to guard our hearts with wisdom and humility. Search us, yes man, search us and reveal anything that doesn't align with your will and even so Lord. Yes, creating us a clean heart and renew our spirits. Make us true, make us faithful both in public and private and teach us to live with integrity that honors you in Jesus's name amen and that's our daily devotion it comes your way at 2.30 Monday through the Friday inside the drive yes man I'm gonna get back onto the musical highway and I was just inspired I had to find this song
