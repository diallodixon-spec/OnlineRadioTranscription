20260101 210810 I love you, I love you the same You did love me and I'm blind because I see what I want Your body in my hands while my head in your palm You don't see how you get all of my attention Family, good friends, love to see how we are going The beauty in my eyes, I have to be older Whenever you wake up, lean on my shoulder You are my baby, without a shoulder The moonshine brighter, the more it gets older And I forever and I Ain't going nowhere, I love you the same Say my name, I don't I be the same? Say my name and I'll do the same. Say no game.
