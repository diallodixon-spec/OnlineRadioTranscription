20251212 193220 I feel it coming Time is of the essence I try to teach you But I need some lessons I need to give it all I try to live but I can't I don't know why you're the one Drowning me out of my mind You don't need no other body. Only you fit on my body. Only you feel on my body. You don't need, no other body. Say not me, the meds of my mind.
