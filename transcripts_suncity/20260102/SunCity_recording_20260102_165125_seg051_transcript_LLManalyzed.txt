She said, I'll tell what you know about me. I'll make love for you, let me tell you what me know about me. Tell you what well you know about me, you can't say your mean You can't live on secret and you like it That's why you come give me back a nice keep When you're left on the top, see me sing your pricey Anywhere we go, do me walk, you'll be beside me We keep on daily at night Anywhere we go the guards are beside me Cause a good body there has a roof in my face
