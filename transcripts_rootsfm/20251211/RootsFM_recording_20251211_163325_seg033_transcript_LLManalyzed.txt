I'll wait for night to come to ring to me. Can't believe I'm the one, I was so lonely. I feel like no one's here, I must be dreaming. I want this dream to be real, I'm in this feeling. I make my wish upon a star, and hope this night will last forever. Oh, oh, oh, oh. Ain't nobody got me better than I am. Make me happy, make me feel better. Ain't nobody, nobody got me better.
