20251226 192514 Another month, you are on my mind Taking up my time throughout the day I try to control, images I see Always you with me, that's in my dreams You give me faith, love I can't explain Fire and contain, what is this girl? I try to fight, but I never win Seems I just get into your embrace But oh, you try so hard not to see Oh, all the things you do to me, girl Oh, my love can't be concealed Girl, you know the deal Baby, stay with me tonight Am I a puppet? You come to me for a quarter of the fight
