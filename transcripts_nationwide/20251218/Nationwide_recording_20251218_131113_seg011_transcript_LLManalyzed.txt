20251218 131113 People say I'm the life of the party Cause I tell a joke or two Although I might be laughing loud and hearty Deep inside I'm blue So take a good look at my face You'll see my smile looks out of place And in the close, well it's easy to chase The tracks of my tears I need you, I need you Since you left me, you've seen me with another girl, seeming like I'm having fun. Although she may be a kid, she does well such to do, because you're the permanent one.
