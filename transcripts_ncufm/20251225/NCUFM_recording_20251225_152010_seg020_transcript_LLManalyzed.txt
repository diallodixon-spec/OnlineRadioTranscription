20251225 152010 The world remains the same There's nothing you can do You're faithful and true Though the storms may come and the winds may blow I'll remain steadfast And let my heart learn when you speak a word, it will come to pass. Great is your faithfulness to me. Oh, great is your faithfulness. From the rising sun to the setting sun, I will pay your name. Great is your faithfulness!
