That is it. All right, let me read one more before I head back to the music. Axar got it locked in. Axar says Happy New Year, Ali Pach, you understand, to you and the Sun City family. Hope to live for the next million years. Which is right, my bro. Well, I don't want to live so long still, but I still want to live to see a lot of years. Many, many, many, many more years. And I appreciate the message, Aksah. More life, more prosperity, more blessings, more riches for you and your family. And keep up the great work, keep producing the awesome music. Zine Axar, big up yourself. Red Hills Road family, from 85 to 100 Lane, always got it locked into Sun City, all because of Axar, the bad artist. Big up yourself, Zine.
