20251218 095242 Mr Williams is saying that's Delano Williams from the NWC. He says there is an electromechanical issue at the plant that supplies Red Hills and Stirling Castle and all those areas. Delano also says they are working to have it fixed today. So Cleveland, the NWC, is aware of the issue in sterling castle in Red Hills. He says there is a an Electromechanical issue at the plant that supplies your community and Delano also says they are working to fix the issue Today, so hopefully Cleveland by the end of the day today that will be sorted and they will address the issue. I see Michelle still typing. I was going to ask if he said anything about the Forest Hill solar water treatment plant.
