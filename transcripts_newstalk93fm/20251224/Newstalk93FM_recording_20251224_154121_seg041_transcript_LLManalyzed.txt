20251224 154121 It was a misunderstanding So we thought you'd get forgotten Don't I promise from today I'll go drunk like I never drunk Waved like I never waved Wired like I never won before Just to show you I'm sorry, I'm sorry And I need you back in my life Look at people by the truck Emotions running high We are not in the sky Just running down we are. Can't you tell that we sorry? We sorry. And we need you back in we high. Come on to me, come on to me This is my apology Follow me, come and see What you mean to all of me You're a treasure in my heart
