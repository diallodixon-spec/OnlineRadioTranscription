20251222 104019 Give love on Christmas Day No greater gift is ever loved But the world needs love And the world needs more love Why don't you give love on Christmas Day The man on the street and the couple upstairs All need to know there's someone who cares Give love on Christmas day No greater gift is ever love I'll never love.
