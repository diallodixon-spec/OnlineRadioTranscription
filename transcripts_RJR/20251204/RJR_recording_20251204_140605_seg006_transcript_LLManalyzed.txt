This is 94.5 Betham. It's swinging my love my love my love. Now don't look so sad at the party Forget your troubles until tomorrow Don't be upset at the party Baby, whenever you're ready Hold my hand when you're ready Let me rock, rock, rock with me, baby. Rock, rock, rock. This is your home for the years. 94. A fan. Perfect. A fan. When it always feels good. Yo, it's Radio Jamaica, two live crew. Turn it!
