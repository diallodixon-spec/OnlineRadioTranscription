can we let the story begin we're going out on our first date but you and me are thrifty so go all you can eat fill up your bag and fill up the plate boys seem to like the girls who laugh at anything the ones who get undressed before the second date girls seem to like the boys So don't appreciate all the money and the time that it takes To be fly as a mother Got my both eyes out for me to write Guessing I just don't know where to find them But I hope they all come out tonight Where do the good boys go to? Hide away, hide away I'm a good, good girl who needs a leave
