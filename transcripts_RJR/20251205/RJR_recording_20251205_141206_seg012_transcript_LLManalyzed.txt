Happy living life in all the moment, clear let me tell you from time, now the love All over the world All over the world Hey All over the world, all over the globe We meet, we know, say we're so unknown And when time we reach, we leave memories, but the people feel it when they think Touchdown, don't touch anything, I love who they bring So I can come in with it with them and feel alright, with it I'm wasting these days on me
