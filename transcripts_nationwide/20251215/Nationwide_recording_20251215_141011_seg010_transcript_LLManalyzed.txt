20251215 141011 When you win it, it's a sweet story And when you're not there, the war is real Quick to call me a sinner Only that I know my history So we are picking the king glory Like a tree planted by the river I a smile when the sun But we like it without all these struggles of mine Can't sleep, summer steam cheese for peace of mind I can't sleep but these sweet dreams do ease my mind I say, what success without an equal sacrifice? We let it all fall, yes you have to have a rise Can't wait to lose your soul, no we're not gonna pay that price I forgive them so life the money
