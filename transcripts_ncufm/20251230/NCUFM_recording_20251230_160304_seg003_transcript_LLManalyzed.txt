20251230 160304 including the man from Plowdon, hereby wishes to want to send happy 47th wedding anniversary greeting to Uncle Fitzi and Auntie Blanche. They're hoping that y'all will enjoy many, many more years of togetherness here in Plowdon. Happy anniversary, counting back from December 30, 1978. Also, special birthday greetings to Ethlyn Thomas of the Shorted Seventy Adventist Church, celebrating her birthday today, December 30. And also, happy 41st wedding anniversary to Charles and Joy Dofus. Happy 23rd wedding anniversary to Errol and Christine Williams. And happy 7th wedding anniversary to Alex and Crystal Friedanke. Greetings coming from the family life department. Enough, enough blessings. I've always heard that June is the month for weddings, you know, but I thoroughly believe December is the right time.
