20251231 145334 dollar was still more valuable than the US dollar excuse me my apologies. Now the Galena actually issued the full text of the Bank of Jamaica statement on how the fluctuation can take place and uh we can't read the full statement for you but we can probably give you probably a summary of what it says it says in terms of fluctuation excuse me Jamaica uses sterling as its intervention currency that is the Bank of Jamaica buys or sells sterling as needed
