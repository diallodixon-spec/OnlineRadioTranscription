We need the help. So there's no way at all I'm going to sit down and keep my mouth shut when the people are used to falling and as soon as February, March come in that's when the whole lot of rain start to fall again. So we're not taking the help from the government. We don't know what we're going to do. Bart Rowe had other pressing issues. He expressed concerns about security and says there is need for enhanced policing. What do you mean by step up Marvin? As in like they are from the community but they are living on the outside but the civilians cannot do the work well the police supposed to do. So we made a step up. We have things that take place in the community. I'm not going to hide anything anymore.
