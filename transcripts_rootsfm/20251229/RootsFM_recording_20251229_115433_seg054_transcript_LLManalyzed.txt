20251229 115433 We look forward to the days ahead. We look forward to what you have in store for us. And we commit ourselves to worship you. As a people, many of us have not given you the kind of worship that you ought and you deserve. But we pray to God for salvation. We pray to God in the heart of men and women. Return to us. Even as we come towards the end of the year. Oh God, they cry out to you, they look to you and they really truly honor you for who you are in their lives. Remember your people. Mighty God, you created them for worship. You created them that they will in turn honor you and you have been kind to them thank you almighty god for being our savior and every day we read john 3 16 for god to love the world that he gave his own begotten son that whosoever believeth on him should not perish
