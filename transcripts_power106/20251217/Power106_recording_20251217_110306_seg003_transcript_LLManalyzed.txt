20251217 110306 Speaking to John Mahfood, he is the former president of the Jamaica Manufacturers and Exporters Association. He's also the group chief executive of Jamaican Teas. We'll be talking to him about this 7% increase on our electricity bills and what it would mean for businesses in Jamaica. And it's going to be a double whammy because businesses are going to pass that cost on to their customers. So not only are you going to pay more for your electricity bill, you're likely going to be paying more for your goods and services offered by Jamaican businesses. Yesterday we heard from the president of the Small Business Association, Garnett Reed, raising merry hell about the increase and the fact that it should be reversed. We'll hear what John Mahfoud has to say around about 1130. Before that we'll hear what Rothstein has to say about things in general.
