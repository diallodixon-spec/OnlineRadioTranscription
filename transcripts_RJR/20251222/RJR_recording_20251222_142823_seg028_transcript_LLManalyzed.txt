20251222 142823 If you have a dollar or a million Keep smiling, don't make them see you sad If life's a honey or a vinegar Show them you're happy, let them see the answer Don't make them know, know, know your pain You don't cry, they'll tell you say you're cool And if you cry them until they say you're weak, no Until they say you feel them, they'll rate you anymore, no Are you alone or thinking you're heavy-loaded, no? So I'm gonna take out your problem, mmm Now tell people your business, then use it again So they'll not help you solve them, mmm Then chatting all your obscenes, don't keep your pocket empty Still wear a smile like you're fresh from the dentist And when you have a heart to go, some of them ought to insist Friend on the ground, that you mean we have a dollar or a million Keep smiling and make them see you sad If life a honey or a vinegar Show them me happy me me see the ends
