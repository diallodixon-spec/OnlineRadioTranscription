20251226 150905 It is a holiday. Boxing day to be exact. Wasn't on here yesterday, so. Merry Christmas to each and everyone. You know the tingle. Holiday sees we are alive, give thanks. Remember if you're not on the road right now, you're on your way to an event, or to an event, do it safely, alright? Yeah, you know the tingle. If you're on the road a little more, please, if you're not driving, go easy on the Holocaust. Care to know more R.I.P. right now. Nah mate. Remember the text line 8 7 6 3 9 2 6 2 1 7 the line is open. You know I check in times if a lock ain't hit me up. Sonja Chris Sonic is in the building. Big ups is teared away.
