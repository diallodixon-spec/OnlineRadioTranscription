2025-12-12 15:15:59 Enjoy the whole weekend, my darling. Enjoy your day. She says she's in Haberview and is coming from your friend in Florida. Birthday greetings to my boonoonoonoonoono's daughter. She's Shushi from my loving mom, Barbz. Wishing you God's blessings always. This one is for retired Major Norman and Colleen Beckles. Forty-four years together. That is an absolute milestone. Retired Major Beckles and Mrs. Beckles, happy anniversary to you. Should I say from whom? Shevoni. I'm going to tell you, I'm going to send it and then you can stand up over me, you know, to make sure I say. I miss it. That's so passionate. You're welcome. Birthday greetings to Mr. Pomells from Longville Park, coming from your nieces, Davia, Leisha and Michael. Hope you have a blessed day. Happy anniversary to Mama Shirley and her husband.
