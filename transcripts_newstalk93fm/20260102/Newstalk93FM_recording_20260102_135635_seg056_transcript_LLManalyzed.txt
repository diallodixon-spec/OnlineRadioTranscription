I felt pain when you were afraid. First time I asked you your name. Now you're in my domain and you're safe. And it got me saying, I ain't gonna leave. She loves, she loves me now. And I believe somehow, we're in the perfect place. I ain't going to leave. She wants to come and stay. Can't wait another day. And now I don't seem so far away.
