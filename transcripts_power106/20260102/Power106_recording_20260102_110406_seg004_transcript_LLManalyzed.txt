20260102 110406 Today is the 2nd of January, 2026. Brand new year, same old idea then. We booked up holy for them already and the year just started. What are you going to do? I'll tell you what we're going to do. We're going to talk to you all day today. And we're going to be talking about everything that is expected for the new year in order for us to rebound from the devastation of Melissa to, I hate to say it, I hate the phrase because it was coined by the Americans and we take it up as usual, build back better, but we have to build back better and we hopefully will. We start as usual with the bottom line and we say good morning and happy new year to Ruston Hyman. Morning, morning, happy new year to us. So what you do for the New Year's Eve? Nothing. Nothing sir. You chill out?
