And this person says, good afternoon Dr. Gale, do you think President Trump's piracy of Venezuelan oil by confiscating ships will start a new agenda of piracy globally? I don't know if it's piracy, I'm still waiting to hear the fuzzy part of the law because if the fuzzy part is cleared up then it's not piracy. Piracy is a strong word. It is unimaginable that a country like the United States that is pouted to be the leader of the free world and successfully rich in many areas would stoop so low. It is even shockingly amazing that so many are caught days like zombies in the belly of what can now be ascertained as the beast. Ouch! Alright, sorry!
