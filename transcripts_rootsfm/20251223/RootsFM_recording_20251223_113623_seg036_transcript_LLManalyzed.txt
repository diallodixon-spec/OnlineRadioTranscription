20251223 113623 personally, let me just say upfront, I don't do Christmas, but to each and everyone who wants to do that, whatever floats for you, whatever flows with you. But for I and I, family, I, children, for a long while now, I have to say decades now, going back to where Kwanzaa first come out, and I have big children, they're actually giving me, I have two grandkids, even though I'm so young. But just to be honest, when I started to have children and I started to fade away from Christmas, because I think that many of us can honestly say our families grew up in that vibration meditation and then you know someone has to break the cycle and someone I guess was I you know in my family you know I'm number eight of nine children and there's long story short when I shy away from that you know even in the end
