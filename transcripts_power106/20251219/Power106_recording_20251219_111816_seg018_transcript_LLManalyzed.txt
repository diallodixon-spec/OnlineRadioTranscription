20251219 111816 I get it even yesterday, Simon. Are we monitoring the amount of aid that's coming in? And when we see a certain exercise, is it a government entity that's doing it, or is it a foreign? For instance, when the Minister of Health spoke about field hospitals in St. Elizabeth and whatnot, you say, well, we'll remove, quick. When they check it all a foreign people is a foreign thing and they feel hospital gone or the Chinese ship gone so a lot of people are asking what actually is happening on the ground now and and one of the curious things is we get our regular callers but I'm not hearing people from Black River, from Westmoreland, from Clarendon calling in to say, yo, it's how much weeks now and we still have this issue. Not just light and telecoms.
