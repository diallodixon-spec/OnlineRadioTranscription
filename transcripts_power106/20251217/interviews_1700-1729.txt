**Interview 1: Director General of the Office of Utilities Regulations, Sword Hewitt**

In an interview with Radio Jamaica, Director General of the Office of Utilities Regulations, Sword Hewitt, defended the decision to grant a 7% bill increase to the Jamaica Public Service Company (JPS) post-Hurricane Melissa. Hewitt explained that the storm resulted in a 30% reduction in electricity sales, contributing to an increase in fuel and independent power producer rates. He stated that the rate increase could have been as high as 40%, but the OUR worked with JPS to manage the increase and protect customers from rate shocks. The 7% increase will be spread over a six-month period to minimize the impact on customers.

Hewitt also expressed his expectation that JPS customers will see a reduction in their electricity bills in the coming months, as fuel prices change and the company returns to using liquefied natural gas (LNG). He emphasized that the OUR's decision was made to balance the needs of JPS with the need to protect customers from excessive rate increases.

**Interview 2: Tourism Minister Edmund Bartlett**

Tourism Minister Edmund Bartlett discussed the impact of Hurricane Melissa on Jamaica's tourism industry, particularly the suspension of operations at Hyatt hotels and the extended closure of Bahia Principalels and Resorts. Despite the challenges, Bartlett expressed confidence in the resilience of Jamaica's tourism product, citing the strong demand for travel to the island and the addition of new flights by airlines. He announced that Bahia will return to the local market in the near future, with plans to refurbish and expand its operations, including the construction of a new 350-room luxury hotel.

Bartlett emphasized that the tourism industry remains a vital part of Jamaica's economy and that the government is committed to supporting its growth and development. He noted that the recent closures do not signal deeper issues within the industry, but rather a temporary setback that will be overcome through investment and renovation.

**Interview 3: Mayor of Kingston, Andrew Swaby**

Mayor of Kingston, Andrew Swaby, expressed strong opposition to the government's plan to centralize roads and events management, citing concerns about the impact on local government and the community. Swaby argued that the proposed changes would remove key functions from local authorities, undermining their ability to serve their constituents. He called for nationwide consultation with municipal authorities before any changes are made, emphasizing the importance of decentralization and community involvement in decision-making.

Swaby emphasized that local governments have built the capacity and partnerships to manage roads, community infrastructure, and events regulation, and that these functions should not be taken away. He urged the government to strengthen local government systems rather than imposing a centralized authority.

**Interview 4: Dionne Jackson-Miller with Jade Williams, Policy Research and Advocacy Manager at Jamaicans for Justice**

Dionne Jackson-Miller interviewed Jade Williams, Policy Research and Advocacy Manager at Jamaicans for Justice, about the organization's call for decriminalization of sexual intercourse between minors who willingly engage in sexual activity. Williams discussed the high number of cases referred to the court, particularly in St. Thomas, where 58 cases involved sex with a person under the age of 16. She argued that these cases often involve consenting minors who are being dragged through the court system, and that alternative interventions, such as a close-in-age exemption, could be more effective in addressing these situations.

Williams emphasized that the current system is not working, with too many cases being diverted to the courts, and that a more nuanced approach is needed to address the complexities of adolescent relationships and sexuality. She noted that the police are not able to divert cases involving minors, and that the court process can be lengthy and traumatic for the young people involved.
