20260101 165044 I'm sticking to my guy like a stamp to a letter Like birds of a feather we stick together I'm telling you from the start I can't be torn apart from my guy Nothing you could do could make me untrue to my guy My guy Nothing you could buy could make me tell a lie to my god nothing you could buy but make me tell a lie to my god I gave my god my word of honor to be faithful and I'm gonna you best be believing I won't be deceiving my God As a matter of opinion I think he talks My opinion is he's the cream of the crop As a matter of taste he is sad
