20251231 090102 for the good of our nation. Good morning. In the headline news at this hour, as the debate continues over the government's announcement of a $75 million allocation to the Social Development Commission, SDC, to assist churches and faith-based organizations with rebuilding efforts, Social Development Specialist Dr. Peter A. Baker is urging church leaders to decline the funds. Members of the clergy have welcomed the government's initiative, pushing back against comments made by Member of Parliament Everald Warmington, who said he's unaware of any church assisting with rebuilding efforts following the storm. He also argued that public funds should not be used to support religious institutions. Disagreeing with Mr. Warmington's interpretation to the announcement, Dr. Baker said the focus right now is not on rebuilding places of worship.
