============================================================

So your love is burning deep and deep and deep down in my heart and so now Got so much I wanna say And I can't wait another day your love is Burning in my heart and in my soul With a flame that won't let my heart go cold If I keep running in my heart and in my soul Girl I love you so Girl I love you, I love you. Girl, I love you so.
