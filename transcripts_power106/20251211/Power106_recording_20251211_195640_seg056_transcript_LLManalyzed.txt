2025-12-11 21:33:35 That's our program for today. Certainly hope you enjoyed it. We did enjoy it. There's going to be a lot of technical issues here. We'll sort that out and be very ready. I feel absolutely sure of tomorrow. My name is Quickwin Anne Floyd Wright. I'm the producer of this show. Adrian Reed, our technical man. That's the team, because we think that he'll be back tomorrow to present the Friday edition of Purple Play for the 13th or the 12th day of December. That's what it will be tomorrow. All right, we need you now with Whitney Houston's interpretation of that great Christmas Carol. Happy self and Merry Christmas. The End.
