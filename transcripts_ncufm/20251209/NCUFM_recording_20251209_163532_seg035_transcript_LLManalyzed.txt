Introduction is the first paragraph of the body of the letter. Here you state the reason for writing the letter clearly and politely. This immediately lets the reader know the purpose of the letter. So maybe you say something like I'm writing to request permission to organize a charity event at the school hall on December 20. You know what I mean. So it's working. Then we come into the main content. The details or the body paragraphs. Now these parts give more information or explanation about your request or issue. It helps the reader to understand the context and any important details of the paragraph. So you're writing to the principal of Hope High School. You're making a request for permission to organise a charity event at the school hall and then now you're going to say maybe the event aims to raise funds for underprivileged children, safety measures will be observed and the event will be supervised by teachers.
