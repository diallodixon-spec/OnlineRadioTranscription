I feel like whining, like whining And every time I shout I say I feel like lining, like lining Don't wanna be inside, wanna be outside tonight Do we have to tell them, no for sure I'm having a good time Blast my head little tight, I feel dynamite Every time, every time, every time. From the time I take a sip, I'm ready to go. Go-o-o-o, we go go-o-o.
