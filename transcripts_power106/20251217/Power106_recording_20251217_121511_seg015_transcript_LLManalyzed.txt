20251217 121511 We've had some sparks of brilliance throughout the series and it's just for us to put them together for a longer period of time, especially in the batting. I think the bowling's been doing an excellent job, but we're just trying to find a way to get that 300 score in the first inning. We think that if we could post a 300 total in the first inning, it would go a long way in us winning a test match here. So it's just for to bat bat well and bat well not only once, but bat well twice. If we can bat well twice, I think that we can take one. That is Westin's test, Captain Ross and Chase. The Windies will once again be without only batting around Shander Paul, who has been ruled out as he continues to recover from the side strain sustained prior to the second encounter. The game gets underway at 5 p.m. Alex Carey's third test sentry on Usman Qawaja's new lease on life rescued Australia on the first day of the third Ashes test, but it was England who walked off the field happy of the two teams.
