Good question. So one of the things you can do, you need to be in tune with what the students are learning in school. If you get an idea of the topic and a breakdown of the objectives that they need to learn at different level, YouTube is a beautiful resource. Khan Academy work or you can utilize anything that will break it down for you. So students are learning, let's say, how to do the distributive property. Go on YouTube, sit with them, learn with them. Because the way in which we were taught, things have evolved. We're using different methodologies now. It doesn't mean it's not the same thing. So you can sit with their kid and just go through the units with them so that they can understand and you learn with them. You can ask them questions, get workbooks. You don't have to stick to the curriculum. Stick to the workbook that is required by the school. You can get additional resources to support them. Now, okay, so you say you didn't want to go initially, but you eventually migrated.
