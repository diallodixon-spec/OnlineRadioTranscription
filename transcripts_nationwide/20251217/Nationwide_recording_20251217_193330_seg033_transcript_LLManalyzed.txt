20251217 193330 to catch back up on the hours that we've missed. All right. Thank you very much, Minister. I see Abraham wants to take an easy question. I just wanted to use the opportunity just to inform the gentleman who asked the question. At our board, because we believe in transparency, inclusiveness, particularly involving the civil society, we actually have actually observers that sit in our board proceedings, and some of the association actually happened to be a youth organization involved in climate. And within our board proceedings, we actually have a session called Dialogue with the Civil Society, and our intention of doing that is to make sure we hear all these voices that to reach out to our team dealing with governance and the board of affairs and make sure you can be part of the conversation because we do consult with the civil society and it's our way of making sure that no one is left behind in the consultation and designing responsibility.
