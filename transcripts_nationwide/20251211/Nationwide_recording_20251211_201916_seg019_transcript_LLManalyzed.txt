2025-12-11 20:33:00 meant to pick the bride but I mean yeah I get that because imagine you I mean I'm not a Seventh-day Adventist I don't eat meat Jackson doesn't eat meat but I mean meat eaten at my house but come on Marlon the pork is eaten, chicken is eaten, I only eat fish yeah right? And my wife doesn't force him to eat chicken or whatever. He just doesn't eat it. And him not go a road, I eat it. And nobody can convince him to eat it. He has an idea of the things that he eats and things that he doesn't eat just because of how he's grown and us telling him that he shouldn't follow people. But you just touched on something very important, which is the fact that your actions probably carry way more influence than your words. Yeah, true. He never, from him born, he never seen me eat a chicken leg. Yeah.
