But nothing man love their belly enough. Nothing love them belly. But I definitely think it is a plus. But nowadays it seems, especially the younger generation, it doesn't seem as important that the woman can cook, you know, like before. Um, but I think that it's definitely a plus as a good woman, you know wife you're supposed to be able to cook and and and be able to feed your man and And the kids because listen, I don't want no man that I can't cook and then he's going somewhere else for for food because man love woman that can cook especially men that don't really cook and All the love their belly. So I think that I would rather be a woman that can cook especially men that don't really cook and all the love their belly So I think that I would rather be a woman that can cook Alright, so healthy ways to cope besides food food doesn't need to be eliminated as comforts balance is key
