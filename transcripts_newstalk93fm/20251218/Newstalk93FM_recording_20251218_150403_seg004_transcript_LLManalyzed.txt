20251218 150403 Look how these security watch me They don't know I'm out there I just mash up in place and I defect like a jumbie I do one way They don't want me in their posse there They don't want because I do one way I ain't no listen, nothing to say Everybody's got Trump jumpingin' up Doin' what I want Jumpin' up Tell them I ain't livin' Right they don't want me going, no. Until my head gone and I'm miserable. All the money grown, I'm causing trouble. Look how deep security watch me. They don't know I'm out there. I just must have been placed on the deep side like a zombie.
