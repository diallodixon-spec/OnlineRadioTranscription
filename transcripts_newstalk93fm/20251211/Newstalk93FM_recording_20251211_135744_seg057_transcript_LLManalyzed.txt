============================================================

I have nuclear bomb like an American. Can't overstand like an Egyptian. I'm a glyphic when I shift it to the fifth dimension. You get twist up and flat up like a Brazilian. Pile off your face with the mic in my hand and sip a cup of tea like I come from England. A long time I'm a DJ in a dance. A long time, I'm a chant in a dance. I come from the ice of the area. I came from the ice of Jamaica. Watch your jet. Dance off the top. Dance off the lock. Lick off the lock. Charge you once a lock. People really see it and have to lock. Oh, lock. Promote around the site, you have to laugh. How them laugh? Cha-la-la-la, la-la-la. Cha-la, la, la, la-la, la. Can't find no park cause the dance really cock. Gateman a laugh and the cashier a laugh. Can't find a buckle with a cock. Me say me can't find no space.
