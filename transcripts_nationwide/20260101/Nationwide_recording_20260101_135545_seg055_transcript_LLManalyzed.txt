20260101 135545 Nothing's gonna ease this pain Until I'm in his arms again Running downstairs, there's a taxi that's waiting for me loneliness I'm gonna leave you far behind I've walked for days through pouring rain and I think to be with him it's been too long I can't be strong no more Living on the next day night Cause I gotta see my baby It's been too long Since I held him in my arms And I just won't sleep at night
