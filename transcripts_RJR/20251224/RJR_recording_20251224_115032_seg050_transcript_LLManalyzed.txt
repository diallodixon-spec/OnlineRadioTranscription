20251224 115032 who travel up into the U.S. But you're telling us some interesting things because, you know, green card is not really green, so therefore, you know, I don't even know why they call it that. It's not green anymore. I think it must be more pink or whatever. But it is something that allows you to live as an alien in the place. You don't belong there. Right. So your residence is always conditional. Right now now there are some other conditionalities that are tightening up the terms under which you can remain in the United States without them blocking you and saying go back to your yard. Indeed, indeed. So warn us again. We want to share with our listeners and thank you for the kind compliments, Doc. You are one of the persons that I look up to a great deal and I appreciate the work that you do for mankind. You want to look up to me because you're 5'9 and I'm 5'10, babe.
