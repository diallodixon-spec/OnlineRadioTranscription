20251217 105037 Our justice system, if the police go and lock up a politician, you hear the rest of them say Ruel Reed. He was allowed to put sheet over him, come out, cover up. Which ordinary man, police, they'll lock up and they'll get a privilege to come out with on the sheet. They treat you like nothing and pull you and all sort of thing and manna get opportunity to come out on the sheet. We need one justice system here in Jamaica for all all right yes
