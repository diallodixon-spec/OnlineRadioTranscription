If PIOJ say that for the last quarter, there's going to be an 11% to 13% contraction. How do you come out of that contraction in the first two quarters? That would be a recession by anybody's definition. Precisely. How do you do that? Precisely. So we need a minister to answer those questions. What will be GDP at the end of the fiscal year? Because the debt to GDP is fiscal. What will be the debt to GDP? What is it now? What will it be at the end of fiscal year? And I'm sure you are going to take on some of the money. When she was asked by the opposition if the debt to GDP ratio factored in the additional bonds, she said no, it was done before. But she still come to the parliament and said it will go down this year, next year and the year after although she said she never factor in the borrowing money which is deception. Well Julia was just here. All confusion. All confusion.
