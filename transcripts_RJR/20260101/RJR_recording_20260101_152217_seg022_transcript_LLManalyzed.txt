20260101 152217 I liked acting and I loved art. So I saw my career more in the art field or something like that, or in war acting. Then I met a young gentleman who is still in my life to this day, Errol O'Meeley. This was when we were teenagers, still at school. He liked writing all sorts of things, letters, poems, songs. So when I found out he sang songs and he found out that I liked singing, he then said to me, could I put his songs down on an audio cassette at the time? But the idea was to see if anyone in the industry might be interested in recording his songs. So just did that in our apartment you know he banged out the timing on the table and I sang his songs and then we used another cassette player to put some harmonies on and that was it that's that's what we were presenting to people in the business
