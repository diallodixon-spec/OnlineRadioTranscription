20260101 201608 I go by. Bring on me. Lord, won't you take me there if you I'd be here forever Said I'll always be your friend Took a note, promised to get out to the end Now that it's raining more than ever Don't doubt we'll still have each other You can stand under my arm forever You can stand under mine Sun Jack fry eye
