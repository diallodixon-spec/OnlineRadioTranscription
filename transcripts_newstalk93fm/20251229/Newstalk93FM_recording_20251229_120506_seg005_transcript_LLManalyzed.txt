20251229 120506 I don't know about you but I come here to fight Come to play a mask I'm not leaving until I wet Come to play a mass I don't live my life with regrets, no I come to jam on a bumper Come to drink on a liquor Until my head gone and I'm miserable All the money grown, I'm causing trouble Look how the security watch me They don't know I'm out there I just mush up the place and I defect like a jumbo And don't wait They don't want me in their party day
