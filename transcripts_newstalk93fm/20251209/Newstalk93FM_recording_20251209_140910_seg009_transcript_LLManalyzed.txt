So long you've been saving it, non-stop you're like craving it, I want some of that choo-choo, darling. Treat this when it a-rollin', rollin', look back when it a rollin', rollin'. Things nice when it a roll-in', roll-in', and I love how we feelin'. When it a rollin' rollin', it bounce when it a roll in, roll tiptoe And when you know how the team is going She knows what I'm into But just with this over me I've been begging on my knees Want me spend me salary, baby Granny say, yeah Boy, don't twist up your head down there They gon' look out your teeth and put your ass in bed But I don't care, yeah Cause I'm strong and I ain't bad
