I'm out there with a couple But nobody ever made me feel Safe like you Facts Cause when I'm with you I just know I'm fine Know I'm fine You take all the pressure off my mind All the time Patient and kind will not be going out my mind Say from the problems I don't worry cause I'm hard to find I'm from the block, baby It's you and I, baby If the world turn against me Who I got, baby I'll set you up, baby I'll in your arms, baby Come hold me down, come hold me down, huh
