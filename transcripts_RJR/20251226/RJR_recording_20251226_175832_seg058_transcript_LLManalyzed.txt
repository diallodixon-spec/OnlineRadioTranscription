20251226 175832 About how long it took for the baby to come out? About three minutes, perhaps. Wow, really? Yes. That baby was deep on his? Trust me. So who cut the cord? Well, none of us cut the cord, you know. Took her to hospital? Right, at the hospital. Okay, got you. Constable Simon, have you seen the baby since? Okay, so I have planned to visit the baby. I'm in dialogue with the mother every day because she has to send me my daily pictures and videos because it's my baby as well. She has to send me her daily pictures and videos. I haven't gotten the chance because we're in the Porto South buying some stuff to take to her. So once I get that done, I definitely visit her whenever, whether it's at home or in the office.
