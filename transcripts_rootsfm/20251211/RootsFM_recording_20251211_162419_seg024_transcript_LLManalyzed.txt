2025-12-11 23:01:01 I'm in the place where I come let go in Miami the base and the sunset low every day like a Mardi Gras everybody party all day no words all play okay so we sip a little something lay the to spill. Me and Charlie at the bar, running up a high bill. Nothing less than ill, when we dress to kill. Every time the ladies pass, they be like, highway. Y'all feel me? All ages and races, real sweet faces. Every different nation, Spanish, Haitian, Indian, Jamaican. Black, white, Cuban, or Asian. I only came for two days of playing. But every time I come, I always wind up staying. Just the type of town I can spend a few days in. Miami, the city that keeps the roof blazing. Party in the city with the handers on all night on the beach till the break is gone. Welcome to Miami. Campanile. Jamiari. Bouncing in the club with the handers all on all night.
