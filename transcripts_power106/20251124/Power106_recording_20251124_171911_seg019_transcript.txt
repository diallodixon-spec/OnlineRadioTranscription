The song is, what do you call that? It's when somebody sings every song, a cover. The song is a cover by Pickett. Yeah. So it was originally named Mustang Mama, and then Aretha Franklin suggested to change the name to Mustang Sally. Isn't that interesting? Yes. Well, you know, there's some high-quality names associated with this song. Aretha Franklin, yeah. Yes. All right, so next we have a 1932 Ford, and that's Little Deuce Coupe by the Beach Boys. I do actually know this song. You know, not necessarily a big Beach Boys fan, but I am familiar with the Surfer Rock style that they created. Their Beast Boy is from their 1963 album. They actually have several car theme songs over the years.
