I just love the sound of this music. Fimi Credit Union, Datta Fimi music. Thank you for joining me here again on the Credit Union Vibe Show for another week. I always look forward to your company as you join with the Credit Unions of Jamaica to learn more about your finances, current issues, and how credit unions care for you. As we always say, this is the show where your money meets your goals. Since the passage of Hurricane Melissa, we have examined some issues on this show, which based on a feedback, people thought were relevant to their current situations.
