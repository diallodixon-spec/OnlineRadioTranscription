20251226 145338 Everybody's style is different. So you're not going to always love what you see, but the exposure is good. But also, your art is your art. So you may not be able to capture the human body in a piece of work. I can't do real life. Uh but I've seen some abstract work and some other types of work that you know, I'm going to look at it and I'm going to say, I'm not sure what this has said to me. You're not sure but guess what? And then somebody. They're selling it for a million dollars. That's what I'm saying. That's why I'm saying. I'm saying, I'm saying. You just got to believe in yourself. Correct. I see it and I say, what does this say? And then the next thing I hear is, oh no, all the pieces have been sold and all my clients are overseas. So there very well might be art in you. Just don't try to do somebody else's art.
