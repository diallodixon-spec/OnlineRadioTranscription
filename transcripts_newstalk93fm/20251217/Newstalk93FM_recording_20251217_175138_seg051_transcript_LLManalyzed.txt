20251217 175138 Earth is shaking at my feet. Feel a weight upon my shoulder. You're my rescue. You're my remedy. Everything about you frees me. I relax and take it easy. Cause you give me hope, hope. You're like the morning sun, and I'm not alone. You give me hope, you're like the sunrise. No, I'm not not afraid Cause you give me hope When I walk on sinking sand Feeling lonely in a crowd
