Thank you very much for this one Tracy and the staff of Old Harbour Health Centre. Yes, it's an absolutely fabulous change are moving from board houses to concrete and now this government is pushing us backward to contain our housing. What's happening doc? How is the government pushing backward to contain a housing if we had a hurricane and the government is trying to help people just have at least a place where they can put their head and put their family for the time being. Isn't it transient? My brother in Montego Bay, why would you not see this as transient? It's just until you're back on your feet.
