20251215 155337 I think a station, a substation in Westmoreland. I don't quite remember if it's Palliser or something like that. He said it has been a eight-serve Westmoreland police station. I mean, hospital, right? He said during the hurricane, it mashed up completely, and they would have to depend on IPP, Independence Power Provider, to furnish the hospital, right? No. It was a solar plant and it completely mashed up. So what I'm saying, to re-play arm, re-activate that plant, right? The 150 is apartheid because to get, it's not only the subliminal hospital, apparently the barge might be apartheid.
