Thank you so much Let me just say that I appreciate you. I appreciate your listening I appreciate the fact that you so many times reach out to give us feedback and to share right so big up yourself and I hope you continue with us for the How much days left in the year one day? And into 2026. Let's go back to my interview with Melissa Simms, trial lawyer at the International Criminal Court in The Hague. We're very creative, very welcoming people, very social. But the disadvantages that we are disorganized while I'm living in a society that people would describe as one having a very cool culture, which is that they're very, very organized, but they're not as social as we Jamaicans. So it has been interesting to exist in these two environments, because even though I work in the Hague, Jamaica for me is still very much home.
