We have actually done publications and we have a series of webinars and communication documents we are preparing, so it's going to be easy for the access of the information so people can be somewhat self-guided and then have a way of coming back to us if they run into a roadblock so that they can get clarity as to what they need to do to resolve their issues. It's going to be more of a self-help at this time, and if they need to come back for grounding, they come back to the webinars and reorganize themselves as to what they need to do. Okay, great. So as an educator and doctor, how important is education and knowledge building in the work you are doing?
