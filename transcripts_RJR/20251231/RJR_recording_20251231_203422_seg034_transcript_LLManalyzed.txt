20251231 203422 I was in love with when we were young You always said I'd be your number one in your history You'd buy me gummies and expensive wine Out on the town we always had a good time living day by day. Virgin islands in the wintertime, gin and wine with a twist of lime, it's a paradise. I got the feeling somewhere down the line, what we had felt got a while. And now I know that I'm over you. And that's not your fault, you're not what I need to do Move out, move out Cause I don't love you more I tried to warn you more But you were nothing but a toy Oh, move out, move out To play the game before All I've got to do is move on Oh, I got to move on
