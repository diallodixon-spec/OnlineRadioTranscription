20251215 092822 the country. So that's one of the first emails that is sent out to persons when they submit an express entry profile. If the person who asked the question is still on, if you could just let us know if you applied for, if you were part of the express entry, if you did send any such application or the email, well see the person just said I did not apply at any time so maybe that's that's not a legitimate email then and so either do not open it do not click any link that's in it or just delete it if you don't pay any money because a lot of these companies they'll send you emails and once you start filling out the information then you need to pay a fee nor so please yes be very very careful as to some of these emails that are sent out right just yeah please here's another one it says I'm in Canada and my work visa has expired I've applied for extension from IRCC and I'm awaiting a response
