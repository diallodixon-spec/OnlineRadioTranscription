Really, really happy about that, that persons are getting electricity because it's really going to be difficult to have a dark Christmas at Christmas without electricity. And remember that you need to be looking at some of these houses, some of them the roof not good enough for you to put an electric supply in, get the place rewired or get an electrician to look at it because we really don't want to add tragedy on tragedy. Okay? We don't want to have tragedy on to tragedy where you have a fire burning down the little that you have left. So don't just glad to have light and just go and switch on. Make sure that you put your house in a position to receive this electricity supply. And, you know, the program is about titling. I remind persons that there's a scam going around where persons are trying to rent properties to persons that they themselves don't really own.
