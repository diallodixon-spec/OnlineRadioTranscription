20251225 175341 Rockin' around the Christmas tree at the Christmas party pop. Misses all hung where you can see every couple tries to stop. Rockin' around Christmas tree, let the Christmas spirit ring. Later we'll have some pumpkin pie and we'll do some caroling. You will get a sentimental feeling when you hear the voices ringing. Let's be jolly. Take the homes we. We'll be rocking around the Christmas tree, have a happy holiday. Everyone dancing merrily in a new old-fashioned way.
