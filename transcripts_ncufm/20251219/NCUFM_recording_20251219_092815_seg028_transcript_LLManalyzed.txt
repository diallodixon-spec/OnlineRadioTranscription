20251219 092815 My friends and family and the support that they provide me with for everything. I thank God for my family. I'm grateful that God gave us the opportunity to have a chance for life. I'm grateful for these good looks. For the opportunity to go to school. I'm grateful to good genes. I'm from a lineage where there's no hypertension, no diabetes, no chronic heart problems. 2020 vision, everything in check. I'm thankful that God has changed me from being who I used to be and that I don't have to be that person anymore. I can be a better man.
