20251222 114428 I'm gonna love like I'm leaving today Give more than I'm receiving Laugh until it takes my breath away I'm gonna say what he's saying Pray what he's praying I'm gonna love like I'm leaving today I'm gonna listen like I mean it Spend a little more time Hold the ones I love longer Slow down and unwind I'm gonna smile at a stranger Maybe make a new friend Before the day is done Gonna dance in the sun and soak it all in I'm gonna look like I'm leaving Give more than I've received
