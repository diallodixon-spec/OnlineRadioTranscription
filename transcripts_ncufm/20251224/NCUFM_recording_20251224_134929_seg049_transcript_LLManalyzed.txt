20251224 134929 to serve the Lord is not only for Joshua's generation, but also for each new generation of God's people who would read or hear this message. Well, how often have you promised the Lord you would do something, but then you didn't? Why didn't you? What does your answer tell you about grace? And what does it tell you about human nature? We don't often keep our promises, do we? And even when we say we're gonna give up a certain God in our lives, maybe a certain bad habit, a certain movie, a certain YouTube channel that we like to look at, certain games that we like to play, these are our gods. And even when we have encountered God as our savior, we still struggle to give up the other little gods that we have in our lives. So maybe those Israelites had some gods that Joshua was speaking to.
