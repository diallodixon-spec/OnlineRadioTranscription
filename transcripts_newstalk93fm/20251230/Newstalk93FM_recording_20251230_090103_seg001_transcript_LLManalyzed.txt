20251230 090103 I love the way that you bring a vibe With your hands them up in the sky Falling down and up in the time Wine she dreamin' to take a ride on me. Cause she comin' down to please. When she ram a chair, she push it back, all the bamba rollin'. And she saving some for me. I tell it to your eye, love whenever you bring a vine. With your hands them up in the sky, watch we drunk and havin' a time.
