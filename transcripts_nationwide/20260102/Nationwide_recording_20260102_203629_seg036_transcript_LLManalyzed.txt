So we look at for loop, and we look at while loop. So these are things that we definitely have to know. Trace tables. So after we have done our code, we have to trace it. We have to test the code for correctness to make sure that the code is working and the code is doing what it's supposed to be doing. We also do truth tables. And like my approach in teaching truth tables, I allow the physics students. So class curriculum is there, the teachers, the not gate and the and gate and so on. You know, the light switch that's on state and off state, that's also information technology right there and that's also physics as well. Yes,
