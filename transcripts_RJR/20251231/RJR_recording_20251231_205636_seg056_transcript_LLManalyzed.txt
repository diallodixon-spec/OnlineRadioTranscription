20251231 205636 We don't love it, it's my whole time. Come and catch it later, don't jump up, jump up, everybody jump up. Up, up, up, everybody jump, up, jump, up. Everybody jump, jump up, jump, everybody jump. Me fresh again, yes, me fresh again, me fresh again. Don't go tell your friends. I will tell you all, I say I will tell you why you pass it. Raise your one in there. They'll jump around and pass it like you don't care. Jump up, pass it like you do care. They'll jump up like you're a young bear. Jump up, jump up. Everybody jump up, jump up, jump. Everybody jump up. Jump up, up, up. Everybody jump, up. Sit down for a minute. We're done with the, the, the slime and it. We can't take it. We don't love it. We're in a country.
