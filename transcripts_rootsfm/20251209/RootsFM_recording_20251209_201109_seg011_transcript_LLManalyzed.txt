============================================================

We will take the stand against the ones who oppress us And by every every means, we just not give up. Live up now, you would stop killing yourself, cause when the kiddy and start man are gonna need your strength. Because now is not the time to sleep or turn the other cheek, cause the wicked in a Babylon slew you if you're weak. And me say, oh, be my cause out here. And let me stand firm when the wicked rise against the earth.
