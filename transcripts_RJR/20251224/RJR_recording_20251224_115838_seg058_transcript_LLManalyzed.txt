20251224 115838 and seeking your forgiveness. Gracious and loving God, forgive us if we have allowed the shopping and the homemaking to obscure your blessings and Christmas activities to crowd out the wonder of Christ's birth. Forgive us if we unworthily magnify the festivities and other activities instead of giving you reverent praise. Forgive us if our rejoicing excludes those who at this time feel rejected, unloved, and lonely. Forgive our lack of commitment to condemn any power which leaves others powerless. Forgive us when we fail to confront and denounce any person who abuses the weak or who profits at the expense
