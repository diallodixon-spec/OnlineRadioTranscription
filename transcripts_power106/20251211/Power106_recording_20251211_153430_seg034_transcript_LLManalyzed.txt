2025-12-11 16:46:21 on the 18 hour a day point or aspect of our discussion a while ago with Sir P. And I'm looking at a press con, well a post on Daryl Valls' Facebook page made on November 28th, and bear with me here, where he said essentially that a journalist recently stated that she divided the amount of linesmen by the amount of money to be spent and assumed that was the cost or payment for the linesmen or cost per linesman. I must share the answer given as I have seen the same question again on social media. These calculations areogical. In another space, the World Bank had to also correct another media house regarding a similar miscalculation regarding recovery and impact of Hurricane Melissa. We ask that clarity be sought on such matters.
