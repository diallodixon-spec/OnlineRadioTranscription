Again, this is one of my favorite Christmas songs of all time from one of my favourite Christmas films of all time This is This Christmas, and as we trim the tree How much fun it's gonna be together This Christmas, the fireside is blazing bright We're caroling through the night. This Christmas will be a very special Christmas.
