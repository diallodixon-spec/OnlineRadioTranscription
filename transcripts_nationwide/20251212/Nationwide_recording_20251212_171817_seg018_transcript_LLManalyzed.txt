20251212 171817 St. Elizabeth was one of five police divisions in the country to record 30 or fewer murders in 2024. The parish was among the worst hit by October's passage of Hurricane Melissa. Its capital, Black River, received significant damage with many buildings in the town destroyed by the hurricane. Superintendent Minto says nearly two months later, over 100 residents remain in shelters. Black River in particular and some other communities were hard hit since the passage of Melissa. All our major corridors are now cleared and so there's access right across the parish and some of the rural areas access is there albeit it might be single lane but we now have access right across the Parish. We now still have some 23 shelters open with approximately 120 persons still in our shelters. All our high schools are open. We still have some primary schools that are closed. That's Superintendent Cole
