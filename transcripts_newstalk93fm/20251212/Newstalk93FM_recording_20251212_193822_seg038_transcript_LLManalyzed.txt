20251212 193822 The way we move, skin on the skin No separation, need no conversation Nah, nah, nah, on everything It's automatic, going several to a hundred Right in wishing the wheels would fall off Time is ticking, it's taking you too long Right before I decide to go home act like you heard me, only serve it up if you deserve me, yeah girl my love is worth it, press it up y'all, push the stars act like you've heard me, on this I've made up with you to serve me,. Shake it up like a earthquake, press it up, y'all. Push us down. On the bang, bang, bang. Pushin' on my buttons with no hesitation. Gas me up, give me motivation. Tell me why we can't pick a destination. Gas me up. Give me motivation.
