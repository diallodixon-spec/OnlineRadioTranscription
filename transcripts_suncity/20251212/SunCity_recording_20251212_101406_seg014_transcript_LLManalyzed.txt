20251212 101406 You know what makes me young to have that? When brothers make mates and leave a young mother to be a passion. And since we all came from a woman, got our name from a woman, and I came from a woman. I wonder why we take from our women, why we rape from our women, do we make our women happy? I think it's time to kill for our women, time to heal our women, be real to our women. And if we don't, we'll have a race of babies that will hate the ladies that make the babies. And since a man can't make one, he has no right to tell a woman when and where to create one. So will the real men get up? I know you're fed up, ladies. But keep your head up. Give me your head up. Ooh, child. Things are gonna get easy.
