Jimmy, yep, she had plenty. But love for me, she didn't have any. I was inviting her into my heart. But she was out riding in some other man's car. She was my nighttime. Thought I was her star. Yes, I was wrong. But see, I'm strong. Don't a long for me to move on. Oh, please don't worry about me. I'm fine. Please don't worry bout me, I'm fine. I'm only gonna play the fool one time. Only gonna play the fool once. Trust me when I say that I'll be okay. Go, girl I can't get it back, but I don't want it back I realize that she don't know how to act Tried to settle down and look what I get Thought it was my time, but I guess not yet
