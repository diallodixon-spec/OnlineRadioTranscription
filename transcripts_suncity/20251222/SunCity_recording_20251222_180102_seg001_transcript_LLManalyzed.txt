20251222 180102 and big up to all the the JCF members yeah man boy man tell you can you imagine a Jamaica with extremely low crime rate why I hope and pray that it continues into the new year yeah man big up the JCF members doing a really really good job you know man say we don't want to hear that our brothers and sisters are are being locked up or worse, being unalived by anybody. So we're just asking everybody, all the youths them, just please do the right thing. The JCF of yesterday is not the JCF of today. They're gonna catch you if you do something bad. You're gonna be caught and we don't want you to be caught. We have too much talented, smart and fun people in Jamaica to have all of that thrown away. We don't want them somewhere. So please, please let me know.
