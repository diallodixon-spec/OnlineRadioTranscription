20251218 192528 I'm sure you'll find space for this important one as well. Alright. Thank you so much. Alright. I understand that you are to make a present. I won't spoil it or anything but I understand you're to make a very important presentation to the Senate tomorrow. It's not a presentation. I was hoping to table a motion but I I think I may have to postpone it because I think my stakeholders would prefer some additional consultation. I'm not pronouncing that it will or will not go, but I'm still in the hours of tonight in the midst of consultation. So, fingers crossed. Oh, okay. Well, whenever it comes down, we look forward to it. Very well. Thank you so much, gentlemen. Golden Campbell, government senator and attorney-at-law. Thank you. So much. And I would say she wants to turn it now, but she's one of the most cerebral senators I have ever had the pleasure of listening to in the Senate. You should read her tweets. You don't have to social media person.
