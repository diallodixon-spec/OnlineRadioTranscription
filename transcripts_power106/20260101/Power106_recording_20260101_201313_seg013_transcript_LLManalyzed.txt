20260101 201313 I can't make it I try so hard, sometimes I fake it When I see your smile Your laughter keeps me going Makes me feel alive What you gave to me, I'll appreciate it To be the man I've been lately To be my strength, so I can face it Always on time Always on time It gives me the vibes, vibes It fills up my darkest day with sunshine, shine You've been good to me in my long and bad times, bad times Nothing can replace what you do for me
