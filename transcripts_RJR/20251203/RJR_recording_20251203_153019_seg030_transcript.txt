Every time I close my eyes, I think the Lord that I've got you. And you've got me too, baby. Every time I think of it, I pinch myself. Because I don't believe it's true. That someone like you loves me too. The bigger all the nights, I cry myself to sleep. You really ought to know how much you mean to me. Wyatt Carey. Baby Faith. Kenny G.
