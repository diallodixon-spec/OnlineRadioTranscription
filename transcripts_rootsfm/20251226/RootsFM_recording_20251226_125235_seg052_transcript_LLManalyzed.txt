20251226 125235 Thanks to you for calling me blue. I've always lost, but now I'm with you. Before I met you, my sun didn't want to shine. But all of a sudden, you slipped up from my eyes. I can't make the reason in my mind. You gotta be special You gotta be special Cause you've got to be Santa Claus. Santa Claus of the world. Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.
