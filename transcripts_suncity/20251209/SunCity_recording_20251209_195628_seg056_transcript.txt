I know you're gone, me feel the pain The love remain that will never change It make me sad when me hear your name Cut me up, you no there again now One thing me know, me nah go hide my feelings Got no, just the memories And I'm living with the memories We got to be surprised, Lofty, in traffic. We still a question, father People a tell me no bother Light up a split for la canna High reminis, pan this trouble ready to a weaker chop Me nah go figure till one you know I know today, I know yesterday we grow From my blue and black shorties
