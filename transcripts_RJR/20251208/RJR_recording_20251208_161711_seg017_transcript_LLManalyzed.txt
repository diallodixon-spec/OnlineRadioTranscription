============================================================

Lord, I pray. I honor your name. Deliver your mercy. I try hard, but I make mistakes. You're still by my side every step that I take through every heartache and you get the praise and you are my guide and my shield always every time me I gaze and I play hard days you still show mercy and keep me safe Lord
