20260102 164927 I see someone whose life will never be the same again. Because it's even what we found. Forbidden love, love. And the question we are up against. How can it be forbidden if it's love, love, love? How can it be? How can somebody tell me? I've got to make that girl mine. I've been waiting all my life for someone just like you. We both know the feeling's fine.
