20251230 160103 down hospital. So one of our St. John's members, she was at Camp Verly. I was at Camp Verley when I got the news and I took the news so hard. I was so sick from Saturday evening straight until Monday because she was a humble person. She'll be greatly missed. You know, I also saw a funeral service for an elder. I think she was an elder, Spanish-Town, STA church. I'll tell you. A whole lot going on, Drive Time family. When I say you have to support the Drive Time family members, I don't mean it. Michael, please help me send earth-strong greetings to two wonderful people they celebrate their birthday greetings Delroy Anthony Brown and Sandy from Sandy Bay Clarendon and also Lucille Blake
