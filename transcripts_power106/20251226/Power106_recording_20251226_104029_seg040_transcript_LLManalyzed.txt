Hey, hey hey, get up people, some only them can sing this one. It's a song for the poor who is facing separation It's a ghetto people song that only them can sing This one It's a sound for the poor who's facing separation Oh, it smells in my ear, but your ex don't care Like a pig comes to talk to me today No school in the woods, no playground like they should move Hey, hey, hey, apocryphal and they don't look cool They don't know me, seems out of reach
