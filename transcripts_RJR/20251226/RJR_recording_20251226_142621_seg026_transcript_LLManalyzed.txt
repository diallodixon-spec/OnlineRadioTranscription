20251226 142621 I come to boss up to boss up your place I come to trick all these drinks till I fall Tell them it's no behaviour at all I come to walk up to walk up the ways I come to boss-up to boss-up your place I come trick all these drinks til I fall Tell them its no behaviour at all Everybody, everybody, jump up, jump! Jump up, everybody, jump, up, jump drop Show me your rap, right now it's your deal, right? Party on higher heights, you mad? When I get this feeling of fire, blast it like this You can not control this, you can not not go with all eyes on Wine and hold it, twist your waist like wine and fold it, bubble and hold it
