20260102 155430 to you. Happy New Year again. Thank you for the beautiful song we are playing. You know, I have three family members passed away. Right now, there are no barriers yet. Thank you for this song to cheer me up, sister, even from New York, Brooklyn. We have a family member who passed away in a terrible accident three weeks ago coming from town on Sunday. I hear this song in the midst of the suffering. God has been good to me God has been so good to me
