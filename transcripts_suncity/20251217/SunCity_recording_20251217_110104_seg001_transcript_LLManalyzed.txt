20251217 110104 I reach you, I reach you, yeah, I reach you. Reach you in a vision, yeah. Come on. Come walk this down easy street. Attract these angels in dreams and their prayers. Man by the theology, man by the visions of diamonds, man by the magic of holy holding soul So dash away the blues in feeling Spirits said take the world off your shoulders When foot is a grave, my friend Foolish dead to take When fetch a drop, it cannot conquer red, no When fetch wish I dropped, cannot conquer it. I could be wise, yes, yes, yes. I wish I had been wise, but I'll be tough for you again. I'm sorry, but I'm losing. Bye, bye, bye, bye.
