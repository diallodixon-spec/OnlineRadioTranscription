We don't want no batter that I need a little breather Two days on the road, sometime in the middle I see how we need to find the middle For the sake of peace of mind So the middle of the road is where You'll find me and my friend and them because We move so hard, so hard for a week We deserve a party, we deserve a party. We deserve it. Say we deserve it. Yeah, we deserve it. Tell all your friends and them. Tell all the girls and them. Read all your friends and then. And let's get it started. I say, I say, oh yo, oh yo, yo. Oh, so come on, let's make a joke. But let me start it like a joke, like a joke. Let me start it like joke. Party on the road. There's a party on the road. Light it up, light it up. Bring the shots and light it up. Party on the roads. There's a part on the roads. Look at knives in the back. Watch my canal in the front.
