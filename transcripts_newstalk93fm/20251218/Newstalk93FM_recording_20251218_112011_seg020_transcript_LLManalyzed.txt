20251218 112011 with approaching the holidays and being able to stand after the holiday has gone. So one of the first things I would say to us is looking at what does the holiday mean to us? What it has meant in the past? Are those the same things that it's going to mean this time around? So basically, we're going to want to look at what are the priorities we're going to look for in this in this period? Is it to have a new curtains on every window, new furniture in the house? Is it have a good meal on the table? Is it have some good social time with our family? must prioritize is it to attend all the parties around town is it to have the best outfit one for every party that we attend every social event we attend we have to prioritize what it is that's important
