20251225 155438 I wish you love and joy And no one ever can destroy The love I've got for you getting the hang of feeding the partridge now, although it was difficult at first to win its confidence. It bit the mother rather badly in the hand, but they're good friends now, and we're keeping the pear tree indoors in a bucket. Thank you again, yours affectionately, Govenor O'Lownessie.
