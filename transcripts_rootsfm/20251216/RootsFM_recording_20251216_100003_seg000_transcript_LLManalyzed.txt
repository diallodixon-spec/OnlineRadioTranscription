20251216 100003 And I'll be here every year, every Christmas. Mere words can't explain the pain I feel. You're driving through Kingston, who do you listen to? Roots Affirm, 96.1. You're listening to Roots 96.1 FM, owned and operated by the Mustard Seed Communities, giving voice to the voiceless. Denise, Denise, I see similar with Roots Allergy, which is the in-week thriller from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. Sorry, sir, it never go to all week and we are food for thought. Your health is a well, then love boss, love boss, that is a must. And a idiot, idiot, idiot thing that they will close it off at the end of the week with Fire Friday, which are the talk of the street.
