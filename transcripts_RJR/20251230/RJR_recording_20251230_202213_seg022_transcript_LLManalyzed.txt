20251230 202213 We got so close together I know she'll stick around Remove all the hearts they construct and right now all I'm thinking of is kids and wife Do drop some love on me now baby I can't get free Can't believe I'm not dreaming this is reality There's never a time I'm thinking that I don't think of you baby So deeply in love I'm sinking I don't know what to do
