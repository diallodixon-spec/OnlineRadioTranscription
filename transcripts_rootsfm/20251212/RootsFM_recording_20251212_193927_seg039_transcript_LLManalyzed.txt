20251212 193927 Moving like a nuclear DJ wants to test me on if I find a new gear But you're moving, moving like a nuclear DJ want to test me on I must be prepared The big cake is here and would you want him share And not today, yesterday, neither last year Long time in there, so you know I must be prepared I go and bust like a balloon in the atmosphere Because I'm moving, moving like nuclear DJ wants am trying to find a new game I am going to sell some orange on the sidewalk I am in a new business and just a sky lock. Some for them a whale, some for them a shark, some for them don't. And no one go back but I am moving, moving like a nuclear. If you try to test me then they must be paid, but you're moving, moving like nuclear.
