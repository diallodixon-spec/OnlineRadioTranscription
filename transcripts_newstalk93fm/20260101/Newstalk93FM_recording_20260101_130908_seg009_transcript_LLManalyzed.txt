20260101 130908 They come to jam on a bumper, come to drink all the liquor. Until my head's gone and I'm miserable. All down on the ground, I'm causing trouble. Look how the security are watching me. They don't know I'm out there. And it's much a big place, and I defect like a jumby. And to one way, they don't want me in their party, they. They don't want me because I do. One way. They don't me me in their posse, they don't want me cause I do one way. They don't want in their posse. I don't listen to nothing they say. Every fact I draw, jumping up, doing what I want. Jumping up, tell them I ain't leaving, right they are sleeping. Every fact that draw, jumping up. Doing what I want, jumping up, telling my you're leaving, right they're sleeping. They say I'm too out of control But there's too much action
