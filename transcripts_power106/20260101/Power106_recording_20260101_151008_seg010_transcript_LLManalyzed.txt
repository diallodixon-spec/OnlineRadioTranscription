20260101 151008 Every day Don't try to hide it, love, there's no disguise I see the fire burning in your eyes Only when I'm dancing can I feel this free At night, I lock the doors where no one else can see I'm tired of dancing here all by myself Tonight, I wanna dance with someone else Get into the groove, boy Oh What will it be? Will all your fantasy be here with me? Just let the music set you free Touch my body, move in time Now I know you're mine
