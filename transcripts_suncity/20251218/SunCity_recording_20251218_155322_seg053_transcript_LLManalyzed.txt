20251218 155322 You and I, sharing this time together Sharing the same dreams As time goes by, we will find These are the special times Times we'll remember These are the precious times The tender times We're holding our hearts forever These are the sweetest times These times together And through it all. One thing will always be true. Some things are breaking all the times I've shared with you.
