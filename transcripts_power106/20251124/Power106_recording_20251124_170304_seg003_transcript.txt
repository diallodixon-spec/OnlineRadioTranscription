The Jamaica Public Service says it is working to have power restored at the Savannah Lamar Hospital in Westmoreland within the next two weeks amid significant damage caused by Hurricane Melissa nearly four weeks ago. The company's CEO and President Hugh Grant shared the information at a media briefing in the Grill in the Parish on Sunday. He said crews are working tirelessly to reconnect homes, hospitals and commercial facilities across Westmoreland and the wider Western region. Grant said this work is being hampered by challenges such as blocked roads, damaged terrain and heavily impacted transmission lines. He noted that the JPS substation in Paradise, Westmoreland, which is a critical hub for the region, sustained significant damage during the hurricane.
