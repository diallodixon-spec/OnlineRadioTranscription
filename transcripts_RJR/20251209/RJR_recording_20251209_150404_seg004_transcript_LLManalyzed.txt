============================================================

With many children now staying with relatives, friends, neighbours or in shelters after the hurricane, we must be extra vigilant. If you suspect any form of violence, abuse or neglect, report it immediately by calling 2-1-1. Let's protect our children, no matter where they are. If something doesn't feel right, speak up. Every child deserves to be safe. A message brought to you by UNICEF. The best kind of insurance is the one you don't have to think about, especially when you have more on your mind. With GK General Insurance, that promise is built in, in-branch, online or on the app.
