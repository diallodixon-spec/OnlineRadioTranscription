What is the constituted authority? The constituted authority is a body of persons, I believe it's five persons, that is established under the Representation of the People Act. Under, well, under an amendment to Representation of People Act that happened in, I think, 1997 or thereabouts. And these five persons who are given this authority, they have authority over election matters. Let me just read from Section 44A of the Representation of People Act. There shall be established on the issuing of an election notice by a returning officer, a body to be known as the constituted authority, which shall continue in force for a period ending six months after the day referred to in Section 22, which is Election Day.
