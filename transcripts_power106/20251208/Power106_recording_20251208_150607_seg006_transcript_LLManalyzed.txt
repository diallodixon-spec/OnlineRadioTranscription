a permanent solution and then you can follow it up with a substantive action. Let's say you want to sue the person, you want to file a claim against the state, against the executors on the basis that the win is fraudulent or what have you. But let me just hasten to say a good mirror and an open to correction. I think the majority of challenges made to wills end up failing because one, the persons cannot prove that the will is indeed fraudulent, so they can't prove that the handwriting was signature was a forgery, and two, because the wills themselves are valid. Persons believe that once they did not receive anything from a will, once the will wasn't as expected, that the will is automatic.
