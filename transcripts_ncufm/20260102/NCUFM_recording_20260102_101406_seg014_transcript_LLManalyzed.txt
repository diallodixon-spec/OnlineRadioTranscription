20260102 101406 I wanna be in my soul You will make a way away You have always made a way, God Oh God, oh God Some days high and some days low But I will not give up, no I won't let go I know God will make a way for me, yeah Oh, I've been troubled on the left Troubled on the right Just in a new world that I know I'll be alright I know God will make the way for me
