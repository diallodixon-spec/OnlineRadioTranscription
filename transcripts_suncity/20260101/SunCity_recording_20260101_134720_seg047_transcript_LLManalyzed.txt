The favorite winning, second going to Poppy Uso, third going to number six, 2Blue, and fourth going to number five, Midnight Runner, the second choice in the betting. The results now for race number two. The winner there was the second choice on the betting, Whiskey. 268 by 198. Second went to number seven, Bob the Builder, 308.
