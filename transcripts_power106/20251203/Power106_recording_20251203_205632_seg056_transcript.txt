this question that we had in one group that I was a part of, even in persons that are going out and handing out the packages, you know, don't just push something with somebody and that's it. Ask them, how are you? Just get to know the person behind who you're giving, who you're giving a package to. And if you can talk and just humanize the experience for them, it makes them feel better. It makes them feel better! And sometimes just to sit and listen to somebody's account or to allow them to talk, it takes a lot of burden off. That's the medication they need. Yes. And it lets them know that somebody cares. And that is what we need at India, because if they know that we care, that will help. That will help us. What are we? You know?
