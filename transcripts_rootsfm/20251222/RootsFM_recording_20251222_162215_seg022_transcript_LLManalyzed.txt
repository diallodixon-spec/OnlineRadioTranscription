20251222 162215 I'm not a fighter. Don't try to change me. Oh, that's who I am. I'm not a lover. I'm not fight. Don't try and change me. Don't do it. That's who I am, yeah. I told you once before, if we ever had to live live that way I'd rather walk out the door Cause I don't want to live that way Cause I've been dead before And at the end of the day we'll all be sad and dead Everything turned out so poor I don't wanna do that anymore I'm a man of love And I don't think I'll ever change I'm a man of love And to some people it might sound strange I'm a lover, I'm not a fighter
