20251231 203531 recently sat down with Theodore Henry, host of GIS-TV's discussion program Get the Facts, to discuss the damage caused to the environment following the passage of Hurricane Melissa and how NEPA is working to protect our animals and preserve biodiversity. We bring up the swallow-tailed butterflies. What was the yellow-bellied parrot? Yellow-billed and black-billed parrots. Okay, yellow-billed, not belly. Okay. But you also mentioned St. Elizabeth, and one of the things that we know from St. Elizabeth, apart from the river and the mangroves, is the... Coconuts. Very large reptiles. Exactly, exactly. Storm surges have come in, water intrusion has come in, the ecosystem has been shaken. Yes. Are you expecting that people have to interact with some of these displaced animals? Well, there would be, yes, there would be greater interaction. In fact, we've had reports, for example, down in Treasure Beach, they're seeing more crocodiles.
