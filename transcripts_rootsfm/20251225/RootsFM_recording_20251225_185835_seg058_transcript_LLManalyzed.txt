20251225 185835 Come on and celebrate It's Christmas time again Forever he will reign Yes, the Prince of Peace we proclaim Come let we celebrate It's Christmastime again Yes, we will lift his name And next year we'll do it again So when the right time had come And my father sent us his son He was born of a virgin Subject to the Lord gave us all redemption For we were once locked in bondage But with freedom Jesus demanded Now I am a son and you are a daughter in the kingdom adopted Yes the tidings me bring it good Hope is here in the neighborhood No matter if a queen's or a maple wood Make sure you rep Jesus Christ Christ as you should. Hallelujah to the most high. Raise your hands, them up to the sky. And wave your troubles bye-bye, because we come to lift up a gun. I am telling you, Jesus Christ is king. I love the word.
