20251215 105735 I can tell you maybe if you go up by the unit now, there's a lot of patients up there and sometimes they have to be sent over to the hospital and there you sit the whole day without being looked at and you are pained because if they send you out you have to be pained because it's something that happens to me. What is coming out to me is that possibly because of the frequency, in other words, it's going to happen. If we're not careful, we get too used to the fact that the person is going to come for that and not attach a kind of urgency to it. I see where you're going. Not intentional, but I'm very careful about that. If you're a frequent person at the hospital, you are being overlooked. What is the painkiller that you take? You are living in a cold country.
