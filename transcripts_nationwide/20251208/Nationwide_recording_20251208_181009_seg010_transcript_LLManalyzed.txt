Republic of the Congo for a place at the World Cup. Former champions Manchester United are back in the top 10 of the English Premier League after slamming Wolverhampton Wanderers 4-1 at Milano on Monday. The Cameroon international brand in Bournemouth scored twice for United, who are now six in the standings with 25 points, while Wolves remain firmly rooted to the foot of the standings with 2 points still the only team yet to win a game this season. And Bilgar! Wolves have their first goal since October. And here's a bobo! Clinical, absolutely clinical. Fernandez, match coming in! And Mason Mouse took the chance superbly. Well he scored the winner in the last away match.
