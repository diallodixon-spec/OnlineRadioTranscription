20251217 132419 Professor Rosalie Hamilton doesn't need much introduction if any at all. She's been introduced so many times and so many great things said about her based on her accomplishment. I think it's just necessary for me to say good afternoon, Professor. Good afternoon. How are you? I'm good. How are you doing? I'm very, very good. Good, good. I always like interviewing you because it gives me a chance to tell people that I did learn so much from you as a high schooler. You wrote in The Observer at the time and you had a column on trade and policies and economics, a lot of what I went into the classroom and explained I got from you. So I'm eternally grateful for your contribution in that area over time. Well, I must say thank you because, you know, when you write these columns, you wonder who reads it. I did. And you hear, you wonder who reads it and you keep hearing that nobody reads in Jamaica especially now with social media so I'm really happy. Absolutely I used to look forward to your contribution and then David Jessup who was writing from a regional perspective so I had everything covered so I used you a lot in high school.
