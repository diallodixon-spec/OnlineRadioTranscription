20251222 164025 I'm going to heaven one day I'm going to leave all this world for no one wrong I'm going to Heaven one day Sometimes I feel like the world don't get any better When I read the news in the morning I don't want to stay here no longer So I hit my hands to the king of kings Raise my voice like the heaven ring And jump for joy when the day shall come When I get to see the most holy one Yeah, I'm going to hell in one day
