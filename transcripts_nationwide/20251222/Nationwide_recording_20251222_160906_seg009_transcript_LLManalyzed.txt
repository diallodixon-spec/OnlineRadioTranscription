20251222 160906 I remember when I was listening, it was 8.30 in the morning. I was somewhere between Kingston and Portmore. And I remembered, I went on Instagram, my son was like, oh my gosh, her name is obvious out, put it on. And it was an experience in motion, Kareem. Because by the time I cruised through a back road and pulled up at Port Henderson, shot me down, came on. And I was like, and I glanced to the left and there he was on that billboard with the dragonout the dragon stout in hand that knowing smirk on his face and I thought to myself he is indeed the man of the moment he is a man of the moment man yeah man it's good I hope that I can all right so what I'm gonna do for my second listen you see is just start from track two yeah son so I'm not about to play a source I'm gonna start start from track 2 because once I actually go from track 1, I'm going to be stuck at track 1. Yes, start from the bottom. Start from the end. Because if you start from the bottom, start from the end. Then the end of the project.
