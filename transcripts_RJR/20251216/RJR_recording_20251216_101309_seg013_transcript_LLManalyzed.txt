Let me hear about the water commission again. Let's see what they can do about it. Yeah, man. Thanks for bringing your attention. All right. Cool. All right. Enough love. Take it easy. That was the great comrade. NWC, I hope that you are paying attention. If not, we'll forward that information to you just outside of the health center at Hopewell in Hanover.
