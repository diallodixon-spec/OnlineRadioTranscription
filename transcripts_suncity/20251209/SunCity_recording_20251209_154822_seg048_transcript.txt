It's a Tuesday. This is how we do it here on Sun City. Put you in a party mood, put you in a good mood, a happy mood. So if you're hard on the job right now, yeah man, the music is here to help you. Shout out to JD, he got it locked in right now. Sun Millie over there in Kitsitown, wanna go on? Yeah man, speak up to the whole Kitsitown family. Who that Felicia? Speak up yourself, Felicia. What do you mean?
