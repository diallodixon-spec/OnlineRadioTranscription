20260101 124629 Just love my home and be in my world. Just love my home, and be no, no. War up on, down the street, and I'll go round right now Gonna shout a lick of this around with me, and I'll round right You turn YouTube to step up, switch me to make a dupe on a type of mashup Committing to be a crime now, you end up in a lockup The change in our future now, it's time for me to live up
