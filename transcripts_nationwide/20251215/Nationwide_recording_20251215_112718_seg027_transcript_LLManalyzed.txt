20251215 112718 I noticed that Mr. Paul Buckingham would have applied to the court on the two of the election in his constituency, uh, voted on the grounds of malpractice. However, I've been searching and I've been trying to find out if in the history of our election, if only election results have ever been voided on that particular one or at least the one that he's putting forward. Well, in that very constituency in West Central St. Andrew, we had an election that had to be re-run because of electoral malpractices.
