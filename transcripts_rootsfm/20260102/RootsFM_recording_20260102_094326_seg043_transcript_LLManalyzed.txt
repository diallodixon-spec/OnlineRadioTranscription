No, the Lord said, set you still, oh glory to God Almighty, and see, hallelujah, hallelujah, and see the salvation of the Lord God Almighty. And as you read there, I think verse 17, 18, 19, 20, from second Chronicles 20, look at it. It said, and they set the Levites, hallelujah. They set them to praise the Lord. Judah went forth. Hallelujah. The house of praise. Judah. Hallelujah. Glory to god almighty. And they send them to praise the Lord. Just to worship him. To adore him. Lord god I wish I had some time. I wanted to read a little bit of that. But my time is moving fast. Hallelujah, glory to God almighty. And I'm telling you the Bible declares to me that they praise the Lord hallelujah glory to God almighty all they did they did not get the best gun they did not get an atomic weapon hallelujah no one does they can sing a song in Jamaica
