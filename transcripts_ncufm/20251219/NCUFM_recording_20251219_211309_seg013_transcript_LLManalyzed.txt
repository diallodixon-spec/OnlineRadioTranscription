20251219 211309 Just give me the strength to change within I know I'm not all that I can be My weakness seems to get the best of me But as long as you are here I know that I will make it Every step along the way Please hear my prayer A heart like yours Is my desire A heart like yours is what I'm searching for. Full of compassion, nothing wrong with it. Please hear me Lord, give me a heart like yours.
