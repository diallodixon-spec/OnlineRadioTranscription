20260101 102212 I see the clock above the wall The mental bothers me at all These are ever-changing times All of my life It comes back to You and me running out of time I gotta find a better understanding Every day keep forgetting what's mine Gotta find me a way that's demanding And we're holding on to some time Together And we're gonna be all right together All of our lives I feel like I've won the war But it don't bother me at all It's another changing time
