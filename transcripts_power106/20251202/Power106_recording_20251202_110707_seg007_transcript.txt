All my dreams are very special All my life I looked for you And today my dreams come true You need me and I need you Love and us is very special Things you seem to do divine You look straight into my eyes I know what love is meant to be Cause our souls touch differently Love is life and life is living It's very special In my heart there was you holding Love is life, what dreams come true
