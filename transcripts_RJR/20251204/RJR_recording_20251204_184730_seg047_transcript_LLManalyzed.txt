Ravindra and skipper Tom Latham, who both made big sentries, took advantage against indisciplined bowling by the Caribbean men. Riefer says a strong mental approach will make the difference for the Windys in their second innings. We're going into day four, the pitch is getting better for batting. For us, batting out day four, losing three, four wickets on day four, it would be a good day for us. One or two of our guys scoring hundreds, that would be good for us as well. Anything is possible, it wants you to believe.
