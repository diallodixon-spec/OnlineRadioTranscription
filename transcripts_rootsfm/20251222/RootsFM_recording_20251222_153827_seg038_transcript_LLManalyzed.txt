20251222 153827 I've done my share of wrong, my share of wrong. Time and time again. She's still loving me. And I can't deny, oh no, no, no. Since she's been in my life, in my life, everything's been going fine. And I'm proud to leave to the world, yeah. She's mine, one and only. And I ain't going nowhere. I ain't going to leave my lady. Oh, no, no, she's mine. I wanna go nowhere. I didn't go anywhere. I didn't wanna leave my lady.
