But it's different when your channels are taken and if there are no replacements or you're paying the same amount. That cannot be. Now seeing where some messages have come in and I want to thank those persons who sent the messages in. They say that some emails have been going around or sent to them, let me put it that way, sent to them indicating that some charges will be discontinued and there's some more changes to come and there will be some replacements. This should be put out in a press release so persons can understand that because I am confident and know not everyone will either have an email or reading emails. They turn on the channel not seeing anything. The last place they're going to look for is going to their email or if they don't have one what happens next.
