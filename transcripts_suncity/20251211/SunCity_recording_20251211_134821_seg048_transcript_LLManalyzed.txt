Baby, some people want diamond rings Some just want everything But everything means nothing If I ain't got you, yeah Some people search for a fountain The promise is forever young Some people need three dozen roses. And that's the only way to prove you love them. Hand me the world on a silver platter. And what good would it be? With no one to share, with no one who truly cares for me?
