20251222 145542 for me as a person, I want to be treated with respect and dignity. I would want to find myself in a space where I can receive that kind of treatment and I would want to be around persons who will treat me with respect and dignity and if I find that it's not happening or there is a violation of my privacy, my personhood, dignity and so on, then I would be reporting as much as possible. Recording, if I can't, I would write if I can. If I have nothing to write, but to harness social networks to access support. Support groups are important because they are smaller groups that would connect women to other women who are facing similar issues. They will discuss what is happening, just talk frankly about it, look at strategy solutions and where the resources can come so that they can actually feel that there is a sense of hope.
