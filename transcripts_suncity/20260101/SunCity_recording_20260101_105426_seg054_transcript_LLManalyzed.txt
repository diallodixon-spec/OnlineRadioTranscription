20260101 105426 I lose control. Take hold of me. I'm amazing. I won't do anything. One night I cry. It knocks me right off of my feet. Anything while you're loving makes me weak. I am falling in love again. When you do, a little bit. It knocks me right off of my feet. I'm on my feet. Can't escape while your loving makes me feel.
