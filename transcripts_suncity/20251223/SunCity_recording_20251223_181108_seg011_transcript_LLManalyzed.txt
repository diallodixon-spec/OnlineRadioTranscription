I have a feeling that it's pronounced differently. I'm pronouncing it in English, but I see where it's. I have a feeling that it's a French pronunciation. I didn't do French. I actually did Spanish, but yeah, de Ferano. It's over by, it's a lounge over by Big Bye Plaza up on the rooftop. You need to go check it out.
