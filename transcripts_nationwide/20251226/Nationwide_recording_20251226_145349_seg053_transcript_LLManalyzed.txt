20251226 145349 to me Cause even after all this time I still want you But why I can't move on Just the way you did so easily So I wanna know Can I dress you up ever tonight? Please hold on until you're so tight The way I did before Out of control Should've known your love was a game Now I can't get you out of my brain Oh, it's such a shame We don't talk anymore We don't talk any more I don't wanna be alone tonight It's pretty good that I'm not moving I still think about the things you do
