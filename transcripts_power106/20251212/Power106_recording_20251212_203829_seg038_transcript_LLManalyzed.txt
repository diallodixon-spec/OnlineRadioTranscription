He was nominated for the Grammy Award seven times and won twice for Reggae Album of the Year. First for Cliffhanger in 1985 and again Rebirth in 2012. Jimmy Cliff has taken his final bow but his voice will continue to echo in dance halls and churches and quiet moments of reflection. His life reminds us that Jamaica's creativity is indeed world-class and that our stories told in our language, our rhythm, are powerful enough to move the world. May his soul rest in peace and may perpetual light shine upon him and may we, the living, honor his legacy by building a wonderful world of beautiful people that is sung so often imagined.
