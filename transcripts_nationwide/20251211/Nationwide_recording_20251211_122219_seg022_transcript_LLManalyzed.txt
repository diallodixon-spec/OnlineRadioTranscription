travesty over the seizure by the United States of an oil tanker of the Venezuelan coast on Wednesday. The vessel, Motor Tanker Skipper, was reportedly carrying oil that's the subject of international sanctions. Guyana's Maritime Administration Department, MAROD, says it was notified that the tanker was flying a Guyanese flag. But the agency says the vessel was not registered in Guyana. MARUD has condemned the illegal use of the country's flag. It says it has observed what it describes as the proliferation and unacceptable trend of vessels fraudulently operating under Guyana's flag. The Venezuelan government has condemned the seizure, calling it blatant theft and an act of international piracy. In international news, Bulgarian Prime Minister Rosen Zeljazkov handed in his government's resignation on Thursday. He announced the decision in a televised address.
