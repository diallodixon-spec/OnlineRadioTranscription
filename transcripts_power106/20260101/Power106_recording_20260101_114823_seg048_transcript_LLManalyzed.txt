20260101 114823 And I try to sleep with the night sun Every time it all rains I pray to God that you I just can't believe That we're through I miss you I miss you There's no other way to say it And I, and I can't deny it I miss you It's so easy to see I miss you, it's so easy to see I miss you and me Is it done and over?
