across your face. And I've never been this swept away. All my thoughts just seem to settle on the breeze when I'm lying wrapped up in your arms. The whole world just fades away is the beating of your heart It's washing over me, and suddenly I'm melting into you There's nothing left to do, baby all we need is just to be Caught up in the touch, slow and steady rush Baby isn't that the way that love surprises?
