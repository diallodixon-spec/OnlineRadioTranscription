============================================================

Thank you so much Mr. Dan L.D. Thompson. Are you X or are you Y? And I also want to thank the producer of the program, Ms. Anna K. Fuller. Thank you ever so much. Also want to thank you too for sending in your messages, calling in. I know I had some challenges with the phone, but for those who got through, I'm thankful. For those who didn't, hopefully it will be better tomorrow.
