20260102 195643 Every Jamaican deserves to be treated with dignity and fairness. As Leader of the Opposition, I reaffirm my commitment to responsible governance, principled leadership, the protection of the people's rights, and to pursue the national interest ahead of all else. Jamaica is not the responsibility of any single individual, political party, corporation, or other institution. National development is a shared mission that calls upon the strength and creativity of each of us. As we enter 2026, let us all live with purpose and kindness in the spirit of national unity. Let us always look out for our neighbor, support local businesses and industries, and be generous to those most affected by the impact of the hurricane. Let us carry forward the lessons of 2025 and always be guided by the truth that we are stronger
