Oh, I love how you make me feel this way. My love is getting stronger every day, my baby. And after all I went and put myself through, I found that all I really needed was you, my darling. As the sun has its place up in the sky I love you so dearly And all the same there's no need to wonder why I need you, please hear me Say you really love me baby, say you really love me darling Cause I really love you baby, oh I really love you darling And baby all, all this love is waiting for you
