20251217 170607 JPS says the workers arrived from the US and Canada over the last two days. On Monday, over 60 line workers from Greystone Utility Services of Canada arrived on the island. Then on Tuesday, another 40 line workers from the Tempest Energy joined their colleagues, some of whom have been in Jamaica from just before the hurricane. There are about 210 workers from Tempest Energy on the island. JPS says the incoming workers have given a significant boost to their ability to repair and rebuild damaged power infrastructure. Another contingent of workers from Greystone is set to arrive on the island Wednesday night. Approximately 180 Greystone personnel in total are expected in the country this week. The Jamaica Manufacturers and Exporters Association, JMEA, says the recent 7% increase in the energy component of bills prepared by the Jamaica public service company, JPS, could have waited until 2026.
