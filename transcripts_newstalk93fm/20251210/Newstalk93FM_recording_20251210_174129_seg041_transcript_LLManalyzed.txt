Nobody make me stop the world Tell me what to be do when these people don't know what you been through You survive through got you feeling like you made it Everything advanced, nothing that I do is basic Me and Rolls Royce on a first name basis Look her with no chases Only give her hunnits cause she hates seeing new faces Know she want her mind by the stones in her bracelet Little money, be a hot and down station station She told me to pay for it, now she backin' it up Used to date a Bob player, but they wrappin' it up Got her in a penthouse and I'm smackin' it up They gon' point you to the top if you askin' for us
