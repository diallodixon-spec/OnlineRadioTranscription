Joy to the world, then we sing. Let the earth receive her King. Joy to the world then we sing, Let the angel voices ring. Joy to the word then we sing, let the men their songs employ. Joy to the World then we sing, we beat the sounding joy. He rules the world with truth and grace And makes the nations prove And lives of His righteousness and wonders of His love And wonders of His love, and wonders, wonders of His love. Joy to the world that we sing, let the earth receive her King.
