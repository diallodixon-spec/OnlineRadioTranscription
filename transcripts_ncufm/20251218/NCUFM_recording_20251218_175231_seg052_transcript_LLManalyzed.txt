Alright so when I had two radiologists who were very happy that I was interested in learning ultrasound because first of all it would take them off the floor so they wouldn't have to be scanning they would just like write the report and for them that was a major thing so they were very willing to help me so I had a lot of help and my senior at that time also studied sonography so whatever I needed to know she was very willing to help and it was the whole experience being away was good for me so I was earning whilst I was studying and the hospital facilitated all my study time all my exams and still paid me in full so I it was a win-win situation
