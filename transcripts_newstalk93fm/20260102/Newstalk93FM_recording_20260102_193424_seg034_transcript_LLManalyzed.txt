Out there with a couple, but nobody ever made me feel safe like you. Facts. Because when I'm with you, I just know I'm fine. Know I'm fine. You take all the pressure off my mind. All the time. I know it right at home, safe in your arms, baby, come hold me down. Come hold me down, huh? Safe like a key and a lock on me, safe like a creep.
