20260102 180805 I know this is nothing to say Every breath I drop Jumpin' up Doin' what I want Jump All the money grown, I'm causing trouble Look how the security watch me They don't know I'm out there I just must have been placed on a deep track like a zombie I don't wait They don't want in the party there They don't want me cause I do one way, they don't want me in their party. I ain't don't listen to nothing they say. Everybody's got Trump jumping up, doing what they want, jumping up and down.
