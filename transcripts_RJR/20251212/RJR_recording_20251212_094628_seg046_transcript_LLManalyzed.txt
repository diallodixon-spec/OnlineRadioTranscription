2025-12-12 09:55:15 I don't take no chance. A chance at one life, you know. I plan to live my best life. But I'm not your number one. No chance. Groceries and farming supplies Keep your loved ones in mind Give the smile Sharing the love from me to you Some sometimes let me be all on your queue Give the smile, Give the smile, give the smile This season make sure everybody good Did your son is happy to you
