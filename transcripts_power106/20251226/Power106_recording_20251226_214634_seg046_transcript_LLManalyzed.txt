20251226 214634 I fell in love with San Pedro Warm wind carried on the city called to me Te quiero, te amo I prayed that the days would last, they went so fast Tropical, the island breeze All of nature wild and free This is where I go to eat La Isla Bonita And when the sun was late The sun was it's time for siesta, you can watch them go by
