20251215 155826 Hey, shout out to Surf. Got it locked in to set. She's been waiting. Glad to know that you got it locked in and you're enjoying the Monday, Monday. Rewind Mondays on Sun City 104.9 AM, your radio with the difference. Something happened to me, but some people get so jealous of the smallest of all things. I try to help them, to help themselves, to give their lives until they get my spreading room.
