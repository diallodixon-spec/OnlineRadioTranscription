20251219 135936 We're forced to take a break here, but join us next week to hear the stories of the artists themselves. To find out why participation in this year's Potters' Fair was a declaration of economic and emotional resilience. Why it's so much more than an event on your Christmas calendar. Join us then. I'm Joy Kelly. Thanks for listening.
