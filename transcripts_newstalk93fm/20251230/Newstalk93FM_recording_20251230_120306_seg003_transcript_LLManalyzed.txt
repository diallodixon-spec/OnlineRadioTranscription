20251230 120306 I tell it to you I love whenever you bring a vibe With your hands them up in the sky Watch we drunk and having a time Carnival time again And we have all money to spend And we go right down to the end Watch me with me cannibal friend Them, them me cannibal friend, friend, friend Now me cannibal friend Friend, friend, friend, oh ah ah Ah me cannibal friend friend, friend friend now me cannibal friend Until we meet, meet, meet, rumble, beat, beat, beat. Things so sweet and sweet and sweet. Feel complete, cause we love you back and now. Beat, beat, rumble.
