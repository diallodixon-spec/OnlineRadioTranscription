Critics are representing us. Fancy buying mummies. What? Straight cash, not love. I'm a man from my boss. I prove it, couple come. And that time I do know. I'm a freak now. Freak now. You popped in my league. Then you're in the valley. I'm a crap. I'll rip up the freak. I'm up, I'm up. People are there. You're here. And I beg me, call up. But the killer never do it, cause I'm a six-year-old clown. You're a fat guy. You're not who say John Stone. Spin, spin, spin. I'm a fireman. I'm a superman. I serve the most. I drum this combo. You know I don't come bricks. I don't. I don't.
