20251225 183734 Right tonight, there isn't much I need I've seen them come and go But heaven knows I've never done like this in my time After all that I've been through I will walk with you In my time If you love me so much Through each high and low I'd let my heart be touched, in my time, raising my champion. I've seen her come and go, but here he knows I'll never die.
