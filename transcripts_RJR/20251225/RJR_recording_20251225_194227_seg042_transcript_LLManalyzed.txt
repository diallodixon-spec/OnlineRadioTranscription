20251225 194227 As Jamaicans, we must always maintain our national characteristic of supporting each other. These past weeks have shown the strength of our culture of generosity. To our first responders, volunteers, public servants, utility crews, road workers, and emergency teams, you have worked long hours and carried heavy burdens, and we say thank you. To the neighbors who cooked extra food, shared a generator or Wi-Fi service, cleared a pathway, or offered solace and comfort, we are grateful and we appreciate you. To our community groups, churches, and charities who moved quickly to help those who were badly affected, and to Jamaicans overseas who reached out and sent support back home. We are grateful to you. May God bless you all this Christmas. Christmas in Jamaica has always been about togetherness. The sounds of carols and oldies floating through the streets.
