20251231 122722 I'm still far from home But I find my way I follow my heart I know I'll be found someday While I'm lost I learn and live What do you say? Let's have a good time until that day Away every morning I rise I step at the sun I know it is a blessing, so when the evening comes I'll lift up my eyes to live someplace new With my tears in me as far as oh, as far as I can go. Oh, oh, I can't, yeah. As far as I can, oh, oh. Oh, oh.
