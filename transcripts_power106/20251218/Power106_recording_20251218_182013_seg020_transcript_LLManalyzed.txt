20251218 182013 In 2018, I was the first person from this region, especially of African extraction, to be a vice president of the International Govind Body. So the thing was to get the make and say cemented across the world and widely recognized. We were stopped in February 1969 under the first president, the late Enos Grant, who was also my teacher at law school. And in 1972, we became affiliated to the International Chess Federation, which now has over 200 member countries. So, community of names rings throughout the International Chess federation. We have people such as International Master Joma Peterson, International Master Deborah Richards-Porter, and others who serve on various committees and commissions around the globe on the International Justice Federation. So we have made a mark. Absolutely. Just a little bit about what is an Olympia.
