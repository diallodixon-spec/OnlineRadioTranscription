Oh my gosh, all the time. All the time. Don't after a while, them have to stop? Well, I don't want them to stop because I'm not paying them money. Well, that's the same thing I tried to tell you. But you're right with what you're saying. My father, them being my grandchildren, but them, me know how you feel, all right. Not abduction. My son used to go think at an high school School. My last son. And one evening, I work in Manchester. Now I wake up and hear about this massive crash at Ma Cooke Stain. No phone at that time. My big old system and you can't get through that. George, you know, I left Manchester and I'm here to see if he can return. Look at me. I can't eat again. There you go. Yeah, man. Parental instinct. You just want to know, you just want to know that he's okay. Yeah, I just drive off of the work, you know, George, that's the way, you know. So I know where he comes from and gave me some money to go to Jamaica and Thurms and his wife.
