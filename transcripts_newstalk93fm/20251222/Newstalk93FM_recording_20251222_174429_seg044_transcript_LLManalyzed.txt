20251222 174429 So don't feel away You don't like the fast life But look on the bright side, girl I go take the blame I just want you to come and light it up Just a little whining Come and meet me behind the truck and we rev it up Say hold it, keep throwing it back at the way you stopped us Baby no way, we could post up all the pictures you want When you're ready, I go over here But we could meet in the middle and start a bacchanal Play in the middle, hey, what we gonna do now? Jam to a rhythm, heat a carnival, blowin' me heat, hey What we gonna do now, start a whine on it? I say compromise on it Baby, spend time on it I say compromise on me
