So come back, we're strong enough together. No place there can ever be. Strong enough together. Right now is our energy. Strong enough together, soccer is our pattern. We're strong enough together, strong enough together, yeah. Only you can help me understand it You and you alone speak my language And I try my best to keep my head up Every day I get stronger and stronger I feel it If you call me tonight I'm on good time Let me celebrate love and life
