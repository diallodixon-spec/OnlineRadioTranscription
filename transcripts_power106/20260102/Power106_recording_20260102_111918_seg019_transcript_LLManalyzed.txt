20260102 111918 to the person interviewing the Prime Minister in Black River ahead of the fireworks. When you start shake up your hand and get all excited by what the PM said, he's not a good look for journalists. Just saying. But yet the Prime Minister said things are going on, things are built, and we're going to build back better. But nothing has been built. Except for the people who built a couple of houses. No, but they said they were going to do the planning first. Yeah, but how long will the planning take? But it can't do it in two months, Robbie. What about the emergency, you know? The wall has melted again. The master builders, they say they could have been 30,000. Yeah, they can't talk anything. But the fact that... What do you mean they can't talk? No, because you have to pay, remember, say you have to cut new road. You're not going to build back in the same place.
