============================================================

Give me that love, if you give me me I'm not gonna let go Give me make a girl myo Me I got you from my door So many people won't lick my shoes, so baby, chew me, cause I'll be your tooth. And if I undo your two by two, you fit to scream, you can lose your cool. So many reasons are written in the stars, oh my god, you're the reason.
