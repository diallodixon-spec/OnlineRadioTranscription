20251223 193823 Just pick up some nice ones so we can make a good salad. If you see purple cabbage, take up some, at least one of those, right? I want to make the salad look nice and colorful. Okay. I think this is everything, you know. We should be able to go cash out now. This is why you're in such a hurry. You don't plan to drink anything with the food. I just swore some meat you want to eat. Oh, right. Oh, we need rice and peas and stuff to make soup. Silicon you later. Alright. Just take up a pack of that and let's get the rice and see if we can find any sorrel. Mommy, I never expected us to get anything at all to prepare for Christmas dinner, you know. Well, I'm glad we got what we needed. So what's on the menu for this year? Any surprises? Well, you know, the usual, baked and fried chicken, like a curried mutton, you know, your father doing the ham, the regular gunga rice and peas and chicken foot soup and cake and sorrel to top it off.
