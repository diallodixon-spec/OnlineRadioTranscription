20251219 104620 When the rain beats up on the roof Herb just a steamed pepper pot on the skew Life is a dream if you got gratitude So go tell the regime they can't stop where we do now Information you think on your own Or else you're a slave to the things that you know What do you know if you learn every day So be careful of of things where you're sad. Who knows? Who knows, who knows, who knows? I just go with the changing clothes, sending love to my friends and foes. And I suppose I'm pleased to be chilling in the West Indies.
