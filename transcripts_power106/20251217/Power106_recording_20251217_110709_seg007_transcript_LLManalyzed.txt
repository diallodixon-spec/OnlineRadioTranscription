20251217 110709 I don't know specifically what it goes to do. I understand it will be restored by February. Let me tell you what the minister said. The minister said, last week he told us something that was, they were in parliament, they were going to call it scurrilously inexact. Because last week we had the impression that the party would get the money. He said on a particular day, the linemen that were here would be decommissioned if the money never run. Which suggests that since the line men are still here, the money has gone to JPS already. Yeah, no yesterday he told me that the contract was officially signed. You with me? So it is for Keith who wants him to line men and for bringing the train to the other line men so that the man himself can start work this weekend yeah so we can get back light at certain places like Christmas and all that. So the 150 million is purely for lines men and their recruitment. Yeah upfront costs yeah upfront. 150 million. Yeah man because the minister tell us that the money yeah not gonna last.
