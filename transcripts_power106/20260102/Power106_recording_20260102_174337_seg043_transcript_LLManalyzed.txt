20260102 174337 It doesn't mean you won't disappear I'm missing you, baby I'm missing you baby Don't send me long memories Once upon a time Slowly creeping on me I'm an angel on my mind Just let somebody love you I just don't know why Whenever I get close to you You're not alive It's been so long, I'm missing you baby
