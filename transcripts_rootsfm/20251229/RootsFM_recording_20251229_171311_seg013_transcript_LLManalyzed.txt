Chunkunu, which has its origin in West African traditions and evolved during slavery, is known for its colorful masquerade characters, drumming and energetic dancing. The Southwest St. Andrew Band features familiar figures such as a horse head, belly woman, pitchy patchy, devil, jack in the green and warrior. Foster says the band performs largely out of love for the culture, even as opportunities become fewer. He notes that high transportation costs, worn costumes and damaged drums make it difficult to sustain regular performances. Efforts to secure support from government agencies and private sector partners have so far been unsuccessful. He also expressed concern that younger generations are becoming disconnected from Jungkook, as the tradition is rarely taught in schools and is sometimes misunderstood.
