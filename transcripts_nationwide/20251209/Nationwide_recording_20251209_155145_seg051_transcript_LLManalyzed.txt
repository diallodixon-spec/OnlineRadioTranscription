of our planning now in the recovery phase with the credit unions of Jamaica. Right, because I was just about to ask you, you know, if that's what phase two entails. So it's about rebuilding, helping them to rebuild homes, et cetera. Offering moratoriums to their members too. You know, some members had loans and now they're out of jobs. So the credit unions continue to meet their members where they are. And are and you know some persons have loan holidays and they've been reaching out to their members trying to get through to do assessments because that's important yes the need is great but we rarely want to reach the people who are most vulnerable the single mothers the mothers with children the elderly the disabled you know these are the people who really want to get them up and running. So we're still, you know, working on pulling our funds and pulling funds together. And thanks again to our partners and sponsors who continue to make this possible. Talking about partners and sponsors and, you know, pulling resources together.
