20260102 131312 today. Look at your picture just to get me started. I called you up but you weren't there and I was broken hearted. Hung up the phone. Can't be too late, the boss is so demanding. Open the door, open to my surprise that you were standing. Who needs to go to work to hustle for another dollar? I'd rather be with you cause you make my heart scream and holler. Love is a gamble and I'm so glad that I'm winning. We've come a long way and yet this is only the beginning of my love. A thousand kisses from you is never enough.
