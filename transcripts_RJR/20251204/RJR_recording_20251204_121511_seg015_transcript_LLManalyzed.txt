417 for four West Indies, 167 all out. And cricket West Indies president, Dr. Kishore Shallow, says he'll decide within 72 hours whether to step down from the role. Fresh off winning a parliamentary seat in St. Vincent and the Grenadines, Dr. Shallow says the choice depends on whether his cabinet portfolio of Minister of Tourism and Maritime Affairs is demanding. Dr. Shallow, who is into his second term as CWI President, notes there is no conflict in serving both roles,. Joe Root is unbeaten on 135 while Zach Crawley made 76. Fast bowler Joffre Archer is the other batter on 32. He's at the crease. Now Mitchell Stark has been the pick of the Australian bowler so far, bagging 6-4-7.
