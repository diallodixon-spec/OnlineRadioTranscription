20251217 192114 are going to come. Clouds will gather on the horizon. Blue will fade from the sky above. Sometimes plans will be disrupted. Life will take a turn. Hope will seem less than wishful thinking. Sometimes bad news will arrive, and we will weep, and we will wonder. Sometimes we'll get angry. We'll shout with the question, why? And in those sometimes, God is here. God understands. God extends a plan to take care of you, not abandon you, give you the future you hoped for. Sometimes, rains are going to come. God has always stood with us in the sometimes. He'll stand with us in the always. Maybe you needed to hear that. Maybe that's why you're here. NCUFM 91.1 91.3 91.5
