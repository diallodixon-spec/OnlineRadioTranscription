20251229 165233 My Jesus is coming soon, morning or night, or noon. Ready to be set, trumpets will sound. All of the dead shall rise, righteous be in the sky. Going where no one dies, heavenward bow. Oh, help, my home in glory land, a mansion prepared you to rule. I will not slumber nor sleep. Oh, yes, I've got to make it in Heaven, my home in glory. Hey, say, heaven, my home, in glory, like a mansion.
