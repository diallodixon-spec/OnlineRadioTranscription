20260102 130303 Really? One a local, one a man is just a man. It shall be a coronation when we learn, learn, learn. Who knows? Who knows, who knows, who knows? I just go like a draping blouse. Sending love to my friends and foes. And I suppose I'm pleased to be chilling in the West Indies. They'll provide all my wants and needs. I got the sunshine rivers and trees. Believe me. And I say we just move on. Who knows, who knows, who knows. Prodigy and the chronics. Yeah, we just move with you. Three minutes after the ad, one o'clock. Thank you so much.
