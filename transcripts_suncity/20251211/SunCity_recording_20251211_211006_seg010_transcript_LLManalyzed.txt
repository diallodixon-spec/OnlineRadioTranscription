2025-12-12 14:55:55 Let's talk I got a lot to say so I guess I'll start by saying that I love you but you know this thing ain't been no walk in the park for us I swear it only take a minute you understand when I finish yeah and I don't want to see you cry but I don't wanna be the one to tell you a lie so honey you're late to go when you you just don't know what's on the other side of the door when you walk in I talk about everything I tried to remember to say just went out my head so I'ma do the best I can to get you to understand cause I know you'll never go right down I say goodbye but I gotta make the first move Cause if I don't you're gonna start hating me It's lovers Thursday Please don't feel the way it was built about you Girl it's not you, it's me, yeah And I gotta figure out what I need, oh There's never a wrong time to say goodbye
