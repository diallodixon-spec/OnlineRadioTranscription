============================================================

We don't want no batter that I need a stress reliever Two drinks in me hand and a girl in the middle Dive deep up we need to find the middle For the second piece of mine So the middle of the road is clear You'll find me and my friend and them because We're so high and poor weak We deserve a party. We deserve it. Yeah, we deserve it. Tell all your friends and them, tell all the girls it up, bring the shots and light it up Party on the road it's a Party on the road Look at knives in the back, watch for a canal in the throat Party on the road It's a Party on The Road
