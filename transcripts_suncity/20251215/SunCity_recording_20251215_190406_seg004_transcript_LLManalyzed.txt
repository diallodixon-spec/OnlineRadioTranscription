Speaking after a recent site visit of Black River, Dr. Holness outlined that the cleanup thrust must be executed in timely fashion, with new consideration for public health protection and the restoration of normal activity within the town. Meanwhile, Chairman of the UDC Norman Brown says the corporation has assessed the situation on the ground and is mobilizing resources to support businesses and residents so that the town can recover and function. The cleanup will include clearing debris and sanitization of sidewalks and roadways to help improve conditions and allow people to move through the town safely and support the return of daily activity in the town. The UDC says it will provide updates to the public as cleanup activities progress. The Office of Utilities Regulation, OUR, is advising that customers of the Jamaica Public Service, JPS, currently receiving service will see a 7% increase on their December bills. The utilities regulator says this adjustment was anticipated as the JPS had to rely on more expensive fuel sources for generation.
