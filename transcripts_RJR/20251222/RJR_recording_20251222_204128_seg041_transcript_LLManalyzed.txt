20251222 204128 Take away the hurt that I feel As I go through the lonely hills A little bit of salt will never wash away my tears Have you heard? When love begins to die You need someone to cry Not a day! Like a bird you left in Robin's nest And they're just like all the rest You flew away. A little bit of soap will take away your perfume eventually. A little, little soap will never wash away the memories of your name in the night that I call the lonely hills. A little, bit of soap will never wash away my tears
