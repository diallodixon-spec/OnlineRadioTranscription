20251224 194538 You're eating Gungo and rice, not rice and Gungo. Right. All right. Thank you very much Papa Nana, Cleveland. Long time I didn't hear from Cleveland. It sounded like England Pound. I'm trying to chuck him for the rest of the line. I'm gone at the same time. Goodbye Carl, Happy Christmas. And you look at George Jimmy, you look at George. Alright, Happy Christmas Carl. That's what I'm telling you man, that the man doesn't know everything in life. But the brush you use, the coconut brush you use, you have to cut and shine the house and the glass you have to wash two times before Christmas when you're in the country. Oh, alright.
