20251226 212317 Buy anything with him and me and he got me love Jump on the beach with a couple thugs Thief I love but she milly all in hope Still a feel of me, I'm running I look at the league A few acts and wish I could buy the ring Wish me dogs, them did a foe Immortal life Wish me did never think of night-night me Go feed a goalie with all my might The dark dem a drink champagne that's bright, yeah God we not go with that That's why we ain't defeated God we not go without Russian, tell her Get it out her mind Get it out her thoughts This is me, you don't talk You coulda give your life to Jesus Or work with spirit It's either my way or the highway. Girl, we just make things real clear. Now come and tell me your feelings. Who will tell you that I want it? Baby, me just want it.
