20251224 192720 When everything's pulling me in every direction You're my anchor, you're my solid ground All I'm searching for a fight You're medicine for my mind You give me hope, You're like the morning sun And I'm not alone You give me hope You're like the sunrise No, I'm not afraid Cause you give me hope. Such a blessing. Hope. You're everything. Hope. To you I sing. Hope. Oh, no, no, no. Hope. You are my king. Hope. This love we're in. Hope.
