Just to prove to you my love is never ending. No, no. An eternity with you I'll be spending. So baby, take my love. Take it all. My everything, I give it to you. Please take full control of my heart, baby. Take my love, take it all. My everything, I'll give it to you. Please take full control. Take my wings and fly away.
