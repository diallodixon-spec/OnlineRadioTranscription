20251224 212122 So, Pastor, Martha, I'm telling you now about the mackerel, and you see, in the last few days, I've been looking at the mackerel. Today, I'm going to bush past and find sea cassava and come in and cook the sea cassava and put it with the mackerel there now, and just go up and get two pounds of Banga mary fish and well-dried bass and fry them, Martha. And I'm going to take you to see the fish all around, Banga mary and the little mackerel ready. And the mackerel is nice, Martha. I hear you. So, then now continue, and continue. What are we going to do? How are we going to stop for a superman to study a man? You know how dead men they find on the roadside and them they call them, you know? Call them on, call them on.
