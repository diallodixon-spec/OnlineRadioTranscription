20251223 104221 if you take long to pay back then the interest is going yeah okay so and the thing about it i i did what i was saying in it i i didn't even put that card in a eight year ago yeah so that's why we're saying maybe you were scammed yeah so i'm saying it must be somebody coming inside because well we can't say that we don't know we don't know i'm not i don't want you to say that i I'm saying it. Because I have never used the card. I have never pinned the card to activate. So yeah, something must be wrong. Well, that's something that you'll have to sit down with them and work out to them if you want to involve your attorney and their attorney. That's not something that we can help you with from the outside. The fact that you have heard it and maybe they are listening, maybe that will give you a different kind of leverage in terms of dealing with the matter. But that's not something we can help with. Alright, thank you anyway. I just want to make it here to the public.
