20251216 112617 Doreen is on the cruise as well. Good morning to you Doreen. Doreen with a special message here. When I was lost, Jesus found me. When I was in sin, Jesus freed me. When I didn't have the strength to walk, Jesus carried me. If you love the man who died on the cross in order to save your soul, say Amen. And I say amen. Around the shop in Hibernia Crossroad, good morning to Dr. W. Pretty from the Maypin High School from all the staff.
