20251225 163634 I can't imagine living without you Without you My world would just stop spinning Still I would choose to go without you Floating on a cloud each time you say my name I wanna scream out loud, you're driving me insane Driving me crazy baby Each time you fall, I wanna fall Each time we kiss, I'm feelin' it When you're like tonight, too, baby Why do they take my love?
