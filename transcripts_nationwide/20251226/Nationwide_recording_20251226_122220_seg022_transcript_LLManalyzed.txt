20251226 122220 I don't want you to catch me like this, girl. My uncle sent one by, like when my family go for creative, you don't want to hear the price of the people they put on or something. But matters are worse, we hear half of the things they're missing, and I don't sell customs. Girl, how you don't sell customs? You should stop going like you don't have any sense, man. You don't see everybody I talk about in the media? You don't want me to stop listening to you, say? You ever experience that? Customs don't go in your package, suitcase, barrel or cargo unless you ship the item or the agent stand up right there when they inspect it. Listen, customs job is to protect the borders, collect revenue and facilitate trade. They don't collect or store shipment, they inspect and somebody will have to present it for inspection. So how customers ever get so much concern then? And the customers are the only ones involved in the clearance process even though they are dumb enough to talk about it. Look at it this way, shipment delayed, talk to your airline agent.
