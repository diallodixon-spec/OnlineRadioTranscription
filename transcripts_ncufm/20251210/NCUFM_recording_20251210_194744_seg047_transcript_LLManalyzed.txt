If you wanna know, I bet you wanna know Where I'm going, going Where I'm going someday soon Oh, oh I'm going up yonder, going up yonder Going up yonder, to be with my Lord Oh, I can take the pain, yes I can The heartache that it brings. It's gonna hurt sometimes. The comforts in the wind. I'll soon be gone. So man-bearing. Yes, God gives me hope.
