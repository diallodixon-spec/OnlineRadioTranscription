Run, run Rudolph Santa's gotta make it to town Santa make him hurry Tell him he can take the freeway down. Run, run, Rudolph, I'm reeling like a merry-go-round. Said Santa to a girl, child, what would please you most to get? A little baby doll that can cry asleep drinking wet. And then away went Rudolph, whizzing like a saber jet. Run, run to Rudolph, Santa's got to make it to town. Santa make him hurry, tell him to hurry.
