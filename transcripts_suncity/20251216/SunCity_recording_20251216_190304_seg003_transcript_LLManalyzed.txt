Speaking at a press briefing on the acceleration of the Jamaica Public Service JPS restoration efforts, Mr. Vaz says the crews will be assigned to Westmoreland, St. Elizabeth, St. James, Hanover and Trelawny alongside JPS teams and local contractors. The 200 linesmen already have been tasked with work with the existing crews. They will be integrated immediately. They will come equipped to be able to climb the poles and to do whatever they need to do until the equipment comes. We decided on only 200 because that's the capacity that JPS can. Meanwhile, the Ministry of Finance and the Jamaica Public Service, JBS, have signed off on a $150 million U.S. dollar loan to facilitate restoration of the electricity grid.
