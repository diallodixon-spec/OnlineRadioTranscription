I want to thank doctor. Thank you for coming. Doctor B. Consulted pediatrician and director of Bola Health Medical Center for those very useful tips. Also, want to thank um the Credit Union Vibe Show. Always great to have those guys with us. Did I tell Mazie Matthews? Happy birthday. I didn't, you know, our insetter. You didn't. And Alicia Oh, we are safe. This is a nice vibe, man. And again, one more time for my bridge in Tango. Big up a step in Tango on these days. Tomorrow! Tomorrow! The Two Life Crew goes TVJ, not the old show. So I'm going to put on my shirt and shape up myself and get ready. TV tomorrow people. Yeah. So you can watch and listen on TV tomorrow. Watch and listen. 3.30 to 4.30.
