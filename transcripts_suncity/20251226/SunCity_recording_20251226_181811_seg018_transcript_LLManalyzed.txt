20251226 181811 I don't pay my bills for a child,. No man can trick me with about you. I love everything about you. Every little thing for your work, for your talk, for your smile, for your laugh, for your soul, for your heart, for your whole life. When you pass, when you're done, when you're smart, how you look when you're happy.
