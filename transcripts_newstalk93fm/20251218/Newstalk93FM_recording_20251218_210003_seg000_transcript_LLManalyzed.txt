20251218 210003 And it hurts my heart. Still a heart for one and one for all. Still I believe that love is everlasting. How it get so normal? How we so comfortable for sleep? Man a discard and one big up the devil. I know me. Me no respond to what do wrongs. Me no be naive. Rather sing songs and do the right. Who no listen to me? I know better, it not easy Time testing, but I'm strong With love on my mind, love in my thoughts, carrying on Why nobody no believe, dark Still I believe That love is everlasting Yes, I know Love is everlasting, yeah
