20251212 151109 You're a treasure in my eyes. The greatest pleasure in my life. Cause when you're living by the moon, on the sea, how we please, home is where the heart should be. Pretty feathers in disguise. Not together we will rise. So don't you ever let me down again. Cause I depending on you So you better come through this time Please hear my cry and if I ever Let you down my friend It was a misunderstanding So if I took it for granted Then I promise promised from today I go drunk like I never drunk Wait like I never went blind Like I never went before Just to show you I saw you I saw you And I need you back in my life You got people by the truck Emotions running high We underpin the sky
