20260101 165643 In the late 1700s, Scottish poet Robert Burns wrote down the words to this song after hearing an old folk tune that had been passed from generation to generation. It was first established in 1788 and set to the melody of a traditional Scottish folk song. Although Burns' version is the one we most recognize today, it wasn't entirely new. Early versions of the poem already existed and Burns himself explained that his inspiration came from hearing an old man singing it, a reminder that the song already had a long life before it was ever written down. The phrase Auld Lang Syne itself is from the Scots language and roughly means for old times sake. The poem was meant to remind people of friendships, shared memories and moments that shaped them in the time that was. In Scotland, it became customary to sing it at Hogsmanay.
