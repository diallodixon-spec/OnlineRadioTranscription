20251231 130707 I need somebody to know, somebody to hear Somebody to have, just to know how it feels It's easy to say, but it's never the same I guess I kinda like the way you help me escape Now the day bleeds into nightfall And you're not here to get me through it all A little more goddode, and then you pull the rug I was scared to come to use the pain, so will you love? And I tend to close my eyes when it hurts Sometimes I fall into your arms I'll be safe in your soul till I go back around For now the day bleeds into nightfall You're not here to get me through it all
