20251218 192730 I'm Dennis Brooks. I'm Alan Campbell. I'm Floyd Green. And I'm Garth Williams. Catch us on the Jamaican dads podcast right here on nationwide 90 FM Thursdays at 8 p.m. with a repeat on Sundays at 6 p.m. The Jamaican dads podcast is all about providing men with a healthy, safe and functional forum to tackle many of the taboo topics that concern our masculinity. Like everyone else out there, we're dads of varying amounts of experience who come from different backgrounds and often view the world differently. We're definitely not perfect, but we're all brethren and we're all committed to this piece of rock called Jamaica.
