Operating expenses dipped slightly, falling about 2 percent due to what the company describes as a disciplined cost control and a reduced allowance for credit losses, which helped to cushion the impact of lower interest earnings. ISP Finance ended the quarter with a profit before tax of $10.8 million, down 11% year-on-year.

The company says growth was driven mainly by the continued expansion of Visual Vibe's indoor screen network and increased advertising activity.
