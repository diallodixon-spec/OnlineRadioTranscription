Even without many players in this moment, I believe in the teams and I believe we can win any games. Of course it's more difficult, but we... Again, I trust in my players and if we are really focused in the game, we can win. United will be without captain Bruno Fernandes, who suffered a hamstring injury in their last game against Aston Villa. I think it's impossible to place Bruno, but I say that in this morning to the team. I think we need to take the good thing, if there is a good thing on that, that a lot of people need to step up. And if you see that it's not just creation, but every set piece is the guy that is organizing sometimes the team. And that is a good opportunity for everyone to step up.
