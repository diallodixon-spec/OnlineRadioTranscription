20251223 145833 tell your story in the warm, wonderful fashion that you have, and to speak about your soul's calling. I know it's going to speak into somebody else's soul. How can people get in touch with you, whether to get spices or to get shirts? Okay. I do have a website for the spices and it's www.j-u-d-i-n-e o-.com. They can go on the website to order the spices. And for the shirts, it's not yet available through the website. They can call me at 876-437-3487 to order the shirts. Excellent. Well, I really want to wish you all the best. Thank you so very much for what you're contributing. Thank you for being brave enough to tackle your illness in a different kind of way.
