One take all day, and every time I pass the room, you know, all day, when I look, they had done a treatile, you know. So I said, when you're leaving, make sure you carry your tools. I said, carry your tools. No, but I come back and fix, I said, no, carry your tools, not leave your tools, carry your tools! But I said, you heard me say carry your tools. Okay. Okay. Thank God for Kenzick, stepfather. Kenzick stepfather? Yes, man. Kenzick? Yeah, man. Big want something to eat. He's disturbing me, I do him work. When he's done, he gives me a whole one hour lesson on cleaning the tile. We throw up on the tile, we go up on the tile. I make the grout ugly after a while. Big up to all the skilled workers who know what they're doing.
