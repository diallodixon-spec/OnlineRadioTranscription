20260101 131210 I would never tell a lie to you cause I believe in the truth and I just wanna live good I don't want no dirty secrets fighting me and you boy I could only drive one car at a time. But I still want to, but I still want to. Because everything is balanced. Like true life, all we want is balance. To be a good wife, all you need is balance. Bend down, touch your toe, go low and balance. Love comes from a place where we don't get jealous. And we don't live like no no dream sellers I say we keeping it real, I'm telling you like it is I'll be there for you with anything you're facing I'll be your sunlight when it's raining Stay together and we go in places I'll be by your side
