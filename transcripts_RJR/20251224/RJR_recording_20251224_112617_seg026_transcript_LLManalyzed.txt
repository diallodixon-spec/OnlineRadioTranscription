20251224 112617 I'm so responsible I'm so responsible One love reaching out to everybody Whether up in the club or up in the dance or party You're lucky to be where you are Some never make it home back from war That's why me want teach and every one of my family To reach home safe Friends don't let friends drive and drink And me want my friend them can party harder than me.
