============================================================

If you're feeling uneasy, come and change the energy. And if you're a couple looking empty, show me how much you love me. Come and fill it up for me. It's a bottle and spoon and a cup in me hand and a winding up on me, man. Everybody focuses jam, jam, jam. One belief on that is the plan. It's bump like winding, like winding. Oh, oh, oh. And every time I short a take, I feel like lightning, like lightning. Don't want to be inside, rather be outside tonight. Do we have to tell him, oh, for sure, I'm having a good time, plus we're having a time.
