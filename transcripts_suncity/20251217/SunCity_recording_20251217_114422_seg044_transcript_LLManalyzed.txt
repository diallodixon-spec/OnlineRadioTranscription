There was no homeschool existing, which I raised my children the majority of their years. For the first 10 years, I'm originally from Trinidad and Tobago. And the educational process from there to here transitioned to training and teaching in K-12. It's considered K-12 here, which is from kindergarten to 12th grade, and that would be more of kindergarten to high school graduation in the West Indies and around the world, regardless of how they have the educational system classified.
