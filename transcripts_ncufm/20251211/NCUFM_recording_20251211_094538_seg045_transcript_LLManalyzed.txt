depend on glacier-fed streams. We hear the whisper of children who drink from mountain springs. We hear the hum of turbines powered by waters born in the highlands. Guardianship means we cannot stand idle while floods, landslides and erosion threaten lives downstream. We cannot ignore the warnings carved into melting ice. Guardianship is not a title, it's a task. It means protecting water, food and livelihoods. It means standing together across nations and generations to defend what sustains us all. We are called to act, to reduce the harm of rising temperatures, to preserve forests, to safeguard glaciers. Each choice we make, how we live, how we consume, how we care, becomes part of our guardianship.
