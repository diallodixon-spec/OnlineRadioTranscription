Can you look within me And feel me when I'm empty Even when I'm a waging war All I'm looking for Is I'm more than the physical You know how it is, I've been here before I know I might be Sweet, sweet like caramel, like honey Don't be fooled, it could get spicy We could connect, but what would that mean for me? Cause it could get dark, it could get ugly You look like the type that only wants one
