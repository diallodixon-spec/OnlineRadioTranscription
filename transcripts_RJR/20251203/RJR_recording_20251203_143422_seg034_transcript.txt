pediatrician and director of Bola Health Medical Center. Recently completed a Master's in Clinical Dermatology as a Schevening Scholar. Congrats. Thank you. And she earned the award for best research dissertation. So, you know, with families cooking more, gathering more, managing post-storm conditions, she's going to share with us some simple but practical ways to stay healthy and safe this holiday season. It is the season for family and cooking, doc! So we will see a lot of that, a lot more traveling, a lot more gathering. What is one simple health tip you want every household to keep in mind? I think a simple thing that we can remember is just always hand washing. So wash your hands before you prepare your meals, after you prepare meals. Washing your hands in safe water always. That simple tip alone would mean that we're preventing the spread of a lot of foodborne illnesses. So hygiene is important. Hygiene. Hygiene is important.
