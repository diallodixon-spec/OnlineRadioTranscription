20251230 134634 Now, now, now You know the last time I laughed this hard was On the trampoline in somebody's backyard I must have been about eight or nine That was the night I fell off and broke my arm Pretty soon I learned cautious discretion When your first crush crushes something kind When I said I don't believe in marriage, that was a lie Every eldest daughter was the first lamb to the slaughter So we all dressed up as wolves and we loved to fight We are now at the end of our drive. We hope you enjoyed this drive. If you did, please let us know in the comments below. Thank you so much for joining us on this drive. We hope to see you again in our next drive.
