So just for the benefit of your listeners Mr. Brian, the JPSCO based on the representation it has made to the government and based on the 300 linesmen that it will have at its disposal and the attendant infrastructure like bucket trucks and the diggers to dig the holes, to lay back the light poles and so on, it would be able to do that to the tune of 150 million new dollars by the end of January.
