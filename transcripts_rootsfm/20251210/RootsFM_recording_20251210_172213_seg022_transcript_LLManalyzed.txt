============================================================

Every now and then I cry Every night You keep staying on my mind All my friends say I'll survive It just takes time But I don't think time is gonna heal this broken heart No, I don't see how it can if it's broken all apart A million miracles could never stop the pain Or put all the pieces together again And I don't think time is gonna heal
