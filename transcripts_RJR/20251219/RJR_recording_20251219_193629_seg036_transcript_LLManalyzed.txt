Tourism recover in full swing as thousands of visitors arrive on the island as the 2025-26 winter tourism season gets underway. We tell you all about it on this week's Tourism Roundup. Jamaica's tourism industry is on the road to recovery, with several properties once again welcoming visitors following the passage of Hurricane Melissa. Evidence of this recovery can be seen in the more than 300,000 visitors who arrived on the island within the first five weeks after the hurricane. Even after the passage of the hurricane, a vacation in Jamaica remains a bucket list item for many travelers.
