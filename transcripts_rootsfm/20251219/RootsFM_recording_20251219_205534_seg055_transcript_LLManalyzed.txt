As I hurried to be by her side, I asked a thousand times why or why. There's no rhyme or reason in my life with you lying here this way. I'd give anything just to trade places with you. So I'm begging heaven down on my knees to help you make it through Tell me can heaven wait, can heaven wait just one more night Tell me what's gonna take to keep you and me in my life
