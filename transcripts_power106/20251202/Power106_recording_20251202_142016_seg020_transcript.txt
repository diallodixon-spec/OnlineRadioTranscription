Oh, yeah. It's a reggae Christmas, yeah. Presents and cards are here. My world is filled with cheer and you. This Christmas, and as I look around, your eyes don't shine the time they do This Christmas the fireside is blazing bright And we're caroling through the night And this Christmas will be a very special Christmas for me. It's a wicked Christmas, everybody. Come on, come on, won't you shake a hand now.
