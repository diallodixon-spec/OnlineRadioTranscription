with all the fights that Boxing World has put on this year, last year. These are the best professional boxers in their own weight class because they've fought and defeated everybody else on the island. And lastly, but not least, we're going to have Daniel Hilton versus Demar Hazdon. These are two young Jamaican boxers that are very talented. They've gone through the amateur ranks. Daniel Hilton has represented Jamaica in the boxing level for years. He's been all over the world, Uzbekistan, London, you name it. And Demar Hazlam has represented Jamaica as well in mixed martial arts. But they have a rivalry because they're both from downtown and they both went to Stanley Coach. So we're going to see a heated match where they're both going to debut in pro, but only one is going to walk away victorious. So, that's going to be our match to watch out. And lastly, let's go with how much of five? If you have any questions, you can call me and choose.
