20251215 171007 I've been patient and I've been waiting Call me stubborn, but I can't get over it You left and never say goodbye Those tears I cried, no, I can get over my cry and if i ever let you down my friend it was a misunderstanding So if I took it for granted, then I promise from today I'll go drunk like I never drunk. Waved like I never waved. Wired like I never won before. Just to show you I'm sorry. I'm sorry. And I need you back.
