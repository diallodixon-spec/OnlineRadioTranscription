20251225 092014 And every Christmas I'll be there This time of year, we're both away We gotta fall in love again The Christmas time And all the angels in the sky Shine out on us as we roll by We gotta fall in love again, it's Christmas time In my candles, girls, I'm awake, I know, I know Just waiting patiently to hear the sleigh bells jingle, there they go. It was another star, that's the way I dreamed of. So let's fall in love again.
