20251216 215424 This is the world when we live in a cool, happy place, feeling longer, longer. My mama tried to keep me up in these times, but they won't get me out, they're my free time. So I'ma go through every crisis with a green light, and I'ma still stay steady on the recline. Another life, another list, another fight, another bliss. It's still a rattle with the devil. Living up is not the option, so I'ma fight through all the options and watch them reaction. Stay up by myself and try me one and complete. No, I never do anything to contain the energy. The wickedest people in my friend and family. So I'm just here and I'm here. I did a lot of crying and you see the pressure on me. 7th to 8th. Right even with difference. With difference.
