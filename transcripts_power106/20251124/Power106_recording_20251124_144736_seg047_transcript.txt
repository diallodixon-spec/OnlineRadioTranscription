How many executives can I appoint exactly? Isn't it more complicated if you have more than one? So again, the law says you can have up to four executives. We advise two. If you only have one, the will is still valid, as I was just saying before the break, but we advise that you have at least two and you can't go above four executors. All right. So no more than four. You can have one, but we advise having a minimum of two. And we say a minimum of two, God forbid, if something happens to one of the executors. So, you know, you only appoint one executor and that executor dies, then there's no executor and the beneficiaries will have to step up and decide who amongst them will act as the executors. Isn't it more complicated
