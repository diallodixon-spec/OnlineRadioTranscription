20251223 122113 It's my favorite part, we see the lights, they got so far It went too fast, we couldn't reach it, we're done Where's honor, where's the link of charm? Land was still a link apart It's like we could die all young Like we could die all blind If we could see it in 2020 Twice Twice we can see you too. Put that spotlight on her face. We gon' pipe up and turn up. We gon' light up and burn up. I'ma too hot like a furnace. I got a hundred G's in my door, y'all. My diamonds gon' shine when the lights dark. You and I take a ride down the boulevard. And your friends will want to pack us a ball. Now nothing ever lasts forever, no. We'll let it go here in New Mexico.
