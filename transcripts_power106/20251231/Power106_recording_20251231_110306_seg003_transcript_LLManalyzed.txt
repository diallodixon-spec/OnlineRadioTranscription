20251231 110306 Jamaica and indeed around the globe. This is Power Talk. It is Wednesday, December 31. And we take your calls and your messages right throughout the program today. Cindy's Pianocore Technical Engineer also tells me she'll be playing a lot of gospel music today. So just when you hear a lot of it today, know that it's coming from her and not from me. Good morning, how are you doing? I guess I don't really like change, so it's not my favourite time of the year, but it is inevitable. Things have to change and we hope that things will change for the better.
