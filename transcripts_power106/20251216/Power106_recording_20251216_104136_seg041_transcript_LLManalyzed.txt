20251216 104136 about Jamaica right now is that we have a lot of work and I think that is good for the economy. But who wants to pay? My gurus, can you imagine words coming out of the National Housing Act? That is only 667 people apply for the housing grant 667 that's my latest information from the nht and the loan that is on the ground from the nht despite all the other calls from the hurricane is only seven people apply for the loan what okay the nht have to be dispatching people now into the county of Cornwall to help them out to apply for the loan. No councillor, no MP can't help the people in that regard.
