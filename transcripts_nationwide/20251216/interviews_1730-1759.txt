**Security Concerns at the College of Agriculture, Science and Education in Portland**

A recent incident of rape on the campus of the College of Agriculture, Science and Education (CASE) in Portland has brought to light the security concerns that have been plaguing the institution. The incident, which occurred on Sunday night, has sparked outrage among students, who are demanding justice and improved security measures.

In an interview with Nationwide 90FM, Dr. Derek Deslandes, President of CASE, and Cameron James, President of the Student Council, discussed the security issues on campus. Dr. Deslandes acknowledged that the campus has a problem with security, citing the lack of fencing, unmanned tunnels, and malfunctioning cameras. He stated that the college has been seeking support from the administration to address these issues, but has been unable to afford the necessary measures, including a comprehensive security plan that would require $80 million.

Cameron James, the Student Council President, expressed concerns about the lack of security on campus, particularly in the dorms. He stated that the students have been raising these issues, but have not received adequate responses from the administration. James also revealed that the student who was raped has not been identified to him, and he has not been able to speak with her due to confidentiality concerns.

The interview highlighted the need for improved security measures on campus, including the installation of functioning cameras, increased personnel, and better lighting. Dr. Deslandes acknowledged that the college has a responsibility to provide a safe environment for its students, and that they are working to address these concerns.

The incident has sparked a wider conversation about the need for improved security measures on campuses across Jamaica. The Police Civilian Oversight Authority has announced plans to host a program to address these concerns, and the Jamaica Customs Agency has launched a mobile app to provide support to students.

In a surprising revelation, Dr. Deslandes stated that the college has had previous incidents of rape and sexual assault on campus, with this being the third such incident in the past five to six years. The college has been working with the police to investigate these incidents, but the lack of security measures has made it difficult to prevent such incidents from occurring.

The interview also highlighted the need for better communication between the administration and students. James expressed concerns about the lack of transparency and communication from the administration, particularly in regards to the incident. Dr. Deslandes acknowledged that the college needs to improve its communication with students, and that they are working to address these concerns.

The incident has sparked outrage among students, who are demanding justice and improved security measures. The college has announced plans to increase security measures, including the installation of cameras and increased personnel. However, the lack of funding and resources has made it difficult for the college to implement these measures.

In a shocking statement, Dr. Deslandes revealed that the college has been unable to afford the necessary security measures, despite the fact that students pay thousands of dollars in fees per year. The fees, which range from $4,000 to $5,000 per year, are subsidized by the government, but the college still struggles to provide adequate security measures.

The incident has highlighted the need for improved security measures on campuses across Jamaica, and the need for better communication between the administration and students. The college has announced plans to address these concerns, but the lack of funding and resources remains a major challenge.
