20260101 205635 Oh, you're laying me down to a dead and buried On the edge of your night, staying drunk on your vibe The angels up in the clouds are jealous knowing we found something so out of the ordinary You got me kissing the crowd, crowd, sanctuary Try to meet whereek Radio, 93 FM. I still need my mind, boy, boy, boy. Nobody no believe in a love again, because in love then lost. Nobody no believe, in a God again, it seems all faith is gone. Nobody no believe and it hurts my heart.
