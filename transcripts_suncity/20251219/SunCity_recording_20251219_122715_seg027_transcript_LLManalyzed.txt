20251219 122715 I know you see the plane, I know you wish you could have fly one. Right now, I'm running out of money, so I'm going to borrow a thing from CJ Diamond and tell him, do you think I'm going to get my partner? Yeah, I'm going to buy mama everything what she want. Do you think I'm getting my partner? Yeah. Friend, they can't tell me, said them brah. All when the choice not a potion. Brother well a Nike, sister well a lotion. Wait till I get me partner, Joe, Joe, Joe. All when the partner monkey, my auntie. They all let me breathe, they bring spice, I don't save it. Fetch you all the partner taxi, no fa' save it. Forget the trophy, buy the beamer, I them favorite. No this, no this, no time for juice, me talk and show this. When me stress get my partner. I go put it up on the ocean.
