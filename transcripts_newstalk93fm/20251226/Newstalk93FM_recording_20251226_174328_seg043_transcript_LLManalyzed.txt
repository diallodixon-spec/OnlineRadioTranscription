20251226 174328 I love the way that you bring a vibe With your hands them up in the sky Rollin' back and havin' a time Real timing again And we havin' money to spend Yes, we jammin' down to the end See me with me carnival friend, Lord, me carnival friend. I wish it come from there. London, I wish come from there. New York, I wish I come from there. When you come in, my baby, I wish I'd come from there. Atlanta, she come from there. Toronto, she comes from there. And I know that you miss me. I love the way that you bring a vibe. With your hands up in the sky. Falling down and up in a time. Wine and season again. And we have the money to spend. And we jamming down to the end. Running with me cannibals, friend. I had me cannibals. Friend, friend, friend, friend.
