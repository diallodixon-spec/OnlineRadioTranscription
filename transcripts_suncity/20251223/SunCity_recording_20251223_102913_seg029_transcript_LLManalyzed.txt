20251223 102913 I want to tell you how bad it is. Many, many moons ago, I sat in my living room, and my son was there watching TV. And I saw the youngster looking all about, looking all about, and lifting up the cushions in the living room. And I'm saying, what is happening? And he just kept on looking under the sofa, looking everywhere. I said, what are you looking for? I'm looking for the remote. I said, to do what? He said, I want to turn off the TV. I said, and? I can't turn off the TV without the remote. I say, how about us walk up to the TV and press the power button? And when you look in his face, he was like, just the look was like, wow, you could do that. It has a power button. How many of us have children at home who don't know where the power button on the television is? Because of what? Yeah, the ease of everything. The ease of it. We need to do better with our children. Hard times create strong men.
