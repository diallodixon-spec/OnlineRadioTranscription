20251226 091918 My world is filled with cheer and you. This Christmas, and as I look around, your eyes are shining down the tube. This Christmas, my heart saddest place in time And we're caroling through the night And this Christmas will be a very special Christmas for me. Shake a hand, shake a hand now. No, no, no, no.
