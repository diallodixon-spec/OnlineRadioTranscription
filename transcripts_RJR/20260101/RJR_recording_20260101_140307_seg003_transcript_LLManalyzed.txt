20260101 140307 We born to do greatness, greatness is the power inside. Don't waste my life, shoot down something during this test of time. We're born to be greatness, greatness is to pour inside. Don't Waste my life. We are the readers of the world, the future to my own. Bleeding gold and treasure because it's where I'm from. Please don't ever judge me because of where I'm from, remember I was stolen from the mother.
