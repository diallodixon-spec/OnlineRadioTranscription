Now the King of Christmas reigns upon His throne. In the hush of sacred wonder, every prophecy was true. God Himself became our healing, God Himself was born for you. Now the wonder lives within us. Now His truth becomes our song. Heaven touched the earth tonight, bringing love that lives so strong.
