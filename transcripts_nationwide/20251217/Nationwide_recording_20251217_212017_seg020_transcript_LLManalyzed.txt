20251217 212017 Alright, welcome to the show. And no stranger to the show, obviously, Miss Mona made it, okay? Who is a chef turned makeup artiste, turned content creator, focusing on food and beauty. She started using the experience she gained from a decade in commercial cooking establishments in her own kitchen. Now Mona's relationship with food needed to change after she decided if I want it, I have to make it. Since then, most everything she eats is made from scratch. This innovation of her personal and professional relationship with food has lead to brand involvement with rainforest, tasty cheese and more to come. So she's here tonight sharing with us the transformation to her palate and to her plate as the one and only Mona made it. Welcome back to the show Mona. Thank you for having me. How are you doing?
