20251217 090609 Looking out the window, I see that the sun is out, so I know it will be fair seas and calm weather today. Biometric pressure, humidity, and temperature are all normal at this time. So sit back, relax, and enjoy cruising with me and the other god. Auntie Sharon is on. Good morning to you, Auntie Sharon and her cruising family, she says. Have a wonderful day, Auntie Sharon. I hope you will be blessed today. Sister Gregory is on.
