you keep on hitting it oh baby yes your love is too good to be true baby boy your love got me trippin on you you know your love is big enough made me trippin for you this big enough got me tripping on you tripp boy tripping on you Tripping on you I should've known better Can't even pretend like I don't want it again On the brain all the time Thinking of all the things that we did You did something That don't happen to all that It's the way you put it down All knowing no one else around around Got me taking a step on the wild side Cuttin' all ties with them other guys Where you, where you get my eyes? Lovin' me nice and slow You make me wanna come through
