Thank God some good Samaritan helped me, pulled me out of a hole this morning. Because we dropped in a one close to Tivoli there. And some gentleman come, one of them turn in bus the other way in van and pulled me out. There's a hell hole. You thinkland? Go down there and go see problem and try help with the problem. Then you will put your things in perspective. He's long for the money, you know. Who? Your Prime Minister is long for the money. Listen to me. They need to build back some emergency.
