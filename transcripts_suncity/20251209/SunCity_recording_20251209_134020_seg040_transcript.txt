I keep the one if you're late today, it's all right Sandra and the Phil family hoping good afternoon Hey lads, be yourself lizards. Who dem say dem run pass? They never rate me, why you call me now? The soup not call me back They plait up on a scheme against me Good things are leaving against me, yeah Break up my CD, like a free TV Wet up my face in the paper whenever they see me Oh, this is my payout, you feel me? Now I'm picking me up, you feel man, can you see? Surpass me, surpass who?
