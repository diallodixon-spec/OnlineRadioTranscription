20260101 122112 It took all the strength I had not to fall apart, to try and watch them in the pieces of my broken heart. And I've been old so many nights just feeling sorry for myself. I used to cry, but now I hold my head up high and you see me Somebody new I'm not that chained up little person Still in love with you And so you felt like dropping in And just expect me to agree Now I'm saving all my love And for some one who's loving me Go on now, go Walk out the door Just turn around now. You're not welcome anymore. Weren't you the one who tried to break me with your vibe? You forgot to rumble. You forgot to lay down and die. Oh, don't lie. I will survive.
