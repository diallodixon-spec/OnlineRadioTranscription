20251216 165547 So many years ago, but I know I was in high school. When was the song released? I was in High school. Hold on really quickly. Tell me when this was released and I can tell. 2004. 2004. I was 7 years old. You just started primary school. I was in probably grade 2. So you never did know nothing about confession? I knew nothing about confession. Damn times eh? I was in grade 9. I was a grade 9er. You're a bit older than I am. That's crazy. I was 7 years old. I was in grade 2. You're up in age there. Let's go. That's all the time we have. A Special thank you to my technical operator Kevin. Somebody has done it before? I don't think so.
