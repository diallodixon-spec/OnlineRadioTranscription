20251222 180506 Jesus! I'll be there for you with anything you're facing. I'll be your sunlight when it's raining. Stay together and we go in places. Yeah, yeah. I'll be by your side no matter the case. We have a one-way ticket to greatness. Greatness. Girl, I don't want to lie. Because I believe in truth. And I just want to live cool. I just want to living cool. I don't want no dirty secrets fighting me and you. Boy, I could only drive one car at a time. But I still drive.
