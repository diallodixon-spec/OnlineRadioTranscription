20251229 101309 And the chairman of the National Road Safety Council has not spoken to that $100 million yet. Who is the chairman? The chairman of the Road Safety Council is the Prime Minister of Jamaica. And so it tells me that there's absolutely no interest. I saw my minister, I heard him spoke several times this year about some funds coming from traffic ticket. You know, he's unfortunately used traffic ticket funds to do road safety. But okay, it is there. Why aren't you going to rise it? But a year plus has passed and nothing has been done. And I said to myself, no sir. I think I have more interest in road world safely than the government of Jamaica. Sad to say so, because they are the ones who are tagged as the weapons of mass destruction. Yes, United Nations said, safe road, safe beacon, safe people.
