I was just trying to save this child and when I was leaving with the picture, I said no, don't go out there, don't go there. So it just reflected on everything. It was just, everything was happening so quickly. And I think my quick reaction, the way in which I approached the man, he didn't have any time to think. It was an element of surprise. Surprise, right? It froze. It just couldn't move. Mm hmm. Just looking at me. Mm hmm. Um. Now, Councilor Barnswell, I know you're heading to council meeting right now. Yes. Yes. And I'm anticipating that you will definitely have a standing ovation from both side of the aisle. The council is equally shared in terms of councillors there, and I'm sure that they will be giving you standard innovation from both sides, as I said before, and that they should.
