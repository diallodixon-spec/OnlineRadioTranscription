I wish we'd have brought in the coach from Bournemouth. I think he would have been a better fit for us than Thomas Frank. But hopefully he can turn it around. But I just don't want to be mediocre. Obviously, I'd love to be great. But Tottenham has to be a quest for glory. It can't be a quest for being here. It was my pleasure. Speak soon I hope. Will do. We go to April. The new KFC Doritos Zinger. The irresistible flavour of KFC and Doritos. A combo that's finger licking good. The time by KFC is 7 o'clock.
