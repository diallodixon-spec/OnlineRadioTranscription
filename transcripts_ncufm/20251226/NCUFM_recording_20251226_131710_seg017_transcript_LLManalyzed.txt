20251226 131710 At some point in everybody's life, you feel like this. Eventually I'm gonna have to choose And really I don't wanna lose My ticket in the heaven and a chance to be used by you And if it's God that I'm after I just can't serve two masters And before something happens I gotta turn it all around Because I know I can't just have my cake and eat it too. Because it's really easy to stay on the fence and still do you. And it'd be cool if we could love the Lord and still go do our thing. But see, it doesn't work like that.
