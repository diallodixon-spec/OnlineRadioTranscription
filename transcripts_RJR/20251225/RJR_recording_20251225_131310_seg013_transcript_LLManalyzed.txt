20251225 131310 It's the best time of the year Look around Christmas is here I'll be dancing and singing my favorite songs Santa Claus and I really get along So put up all the lights, grab the tree We got so much work to do Merry Christmas to me, Merry Christmas to you When you're in a jingle bell bell, oh, it's time. Relax your body and free your mind. Nothing else but ice, like Christmas time. Get somebody, whatever, Christmas wine. Ho, ho, ho, here we go. Christmas carols on the tree.
