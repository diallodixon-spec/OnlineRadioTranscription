That's not the situation we're talking about, because that is presumed. It is presumed. But we're talking about when the couple is unmarried, where they cohabit, which represents so many situations in Jamaica. Indeed. So many. Yes, indeed. And one of the things that I also want to point out is that there have been instances where the party believes that the person is single and upon further investigations only to find out that after the person has passed that the person was previously married and wasn't divorced. And so that person who thought they were a spouse would be left out in the cold because that wife would still be a beneficiary even though the deceased would not have been living with the person before, whether wife or husband as the case may be. Even though they could have been at each other's throats.
