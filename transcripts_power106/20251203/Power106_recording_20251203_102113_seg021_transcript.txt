And, you know, we saw at the end, I jokingly said to the government bench, when the opposition leader intervened on the issue of the relaxation of the fiscal rules, and there was an error made and he was able to detect it, I said, you now understand what collaboration means. And this is why it's important in everything that you do to include the opposition in a meaningful way. I mean, the order that came had the extension of the fiscal rules till March 31st, 2026, which would mean in another three months' time, she would have to come back with another order. And the opposition leader detected the error, explained what the legislation meant to be, and they had to withdraw, put it back into it. But I'm just saying, there is value in collaboration and including voices, not just your own. Agreed. Thank you, sir. Thank you.
