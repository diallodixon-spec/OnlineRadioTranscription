20260102 214638 I don't think you listen. For me to come out, it must mean I'm not the job. It must mean I'm the same. It must mean that I'm on your case. For me to go out, it means that I'm the job. I want to show you my world. Give me one break. I need faith, faith to believe you, faith to receive you. Give me something I'm lacking, I don't need nothing, you are my everything. Only me and you, only me and you Only me and you
