20260102 165730 I'll lead you to my love From a sinful life I'll plant you in my love For creation bears the weakness of my love I know that you should know it's time for the world to try jai love The only love that can bring peace is try jai love So-ie-ie-ie Try Jalu Love I know that without you there'd be no tomorrow Try Jalu Who lives broken hearts and from sorrow Try Jalu So won't you Try I-I try to love, love. I know that. You should know it's not for the world to. Try to love. They own the love that can be pieces. Try, try to love. So won't try.
