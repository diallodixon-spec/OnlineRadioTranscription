20251225 093517 I just want you for my own. All that you could ever know. Make my wish come true. All I want for Christmas is you. I don't want a lot for Christmas. There is just one thing I need. I don't care about the present underneath the Christmas tree. I don't need to name my stocking, live upon the fireplace. And the clothes will make me happy when the time comes.
