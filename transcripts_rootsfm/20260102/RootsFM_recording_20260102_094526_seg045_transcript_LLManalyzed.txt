20260102 094526 Hallelujah. There is something about humbling yourself and worshiping the lord god. As a matter of fact, they use a like a term and they said when the praises go up, oh glory to god almighty, then the blessing will be coming down. Can somebody praise the lord? Hallelujah. Glory to god almighty and so as you praise him, as you worship him, as you adore him, what it does is that it puts you in a position to receive from him. Do you know what? Receive from him. Let me give you a quick testimony before the time run out on me. I remember one time ago my daughter was smaller. Hallelujah, she's 28 years old now, grown woman. But when she was a little girl, she did something wrong in the house and I came home and her mom informed me and I took out my belt and was about to give her a good beating. We were living in Toronto, Canada and when I lift up the belt like that to give her a slap across her bum, hallelujah, she said, oh, daddy, daddy, don't beat me. You're the nicest, darling. You're so nice and loving. Oh, daddy, without you, what would we do? Mommy love you. We love you, daddy. You're the sweetest. And she start worshiping me, basically.
