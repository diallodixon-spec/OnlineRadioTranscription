How can you do that? It's funny, I watched the PM and a lot of what he said I thought he never even need to be there. I thought that is what Fayval would have been saying. But then when he was asked for details of what he had spoken he said the Minister of Finance will have the details. And she never had any details? No details. Totally unprepared. So what do we do now in relation to our understanding of what took place and is to take place in the coming months? How do we get answers as to what is the reality? Well she will be in the PAC today so the opposition people say that they'll be grilling her in the PAC today. The technocrats will be there so they'll be asked most of the questions. Julian said most of the questions will go to the technocrats not her because she can't answer the question. All right all of that was happening.
