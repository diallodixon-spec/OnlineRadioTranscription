Baby girl this is my love story I take it to a place where lovers meet And we can go together down to lovers leap I never seen myself falling to love so deep But to make me greet is so sweet Cause you let me know who our love is You let me know all our fears Cause I was so inexperienced You let me know that true love is real You let me know that your love is real You let me know who your love is You let me know all of this Cause I was so inexperienced You let me know your love is real If Josh should come tomorrow Aunt Josh should say That he gonna turn the hands of time And we can live for a lifetime Then who would I spend my life with Then I would tell Josh say That I will spend it with you baby I will spend with you Because he let me know
