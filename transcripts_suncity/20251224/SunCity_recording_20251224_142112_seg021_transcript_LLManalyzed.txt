20251224 142112 I am, I am. Enough is enough now. There's attention you can feel it's everywhere you go In the news you can hear it's on the radio What's next you could never know It's in vain, all the system is designed just to scare you What's the scenario? When the water got dried up, so no kind of growth It's's hard that you know you're off the tiptoe. But I listen, I can tell you. Take my vampire, ayo. I take your light, don't you burn up with your fire, ayo.
