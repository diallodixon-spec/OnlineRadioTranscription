20260101 111910 Listen, what you promised How could I ever forget Listen, you know I love you but I just can't take this You know I love you, but I'm playing for keeps Although I need you, I'm not gonna need this You know I'm watching, but I'm in too deep So listen, listen to me Oh, you must believe me I can feel your eyes go through me But I don't know why Oh, I know you're going I can't believe It's the way that you're leaving It's like we never knew each other at all
