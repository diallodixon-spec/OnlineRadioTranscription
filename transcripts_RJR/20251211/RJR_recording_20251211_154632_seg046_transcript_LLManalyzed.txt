2025-12-11 16:53:15 Time seems like it's passing by Just believe that love will find a way I see the tears you cry I see the pain that's in your eyes So many times you were so lonely And no one seemed to care But if your hopes for your tomorrows Are drowning in your sorrows Know your heart will show you the way. DJ, yes. Throw my mind away.
