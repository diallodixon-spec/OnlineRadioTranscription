And you go home and when you sit down and look at all the receipts, you know, you say, oh, whoa, some people don't look at the receipts. So that's why it's best when you even have it on the cards and it comes up on line up right away. It comes up on line so you can keep a track and you can see exactly where you are. And another very important point, that is where budgeting comes into play, because if you have a set budget that this is the amount and that's it that budget that we have set. And we keep track of it by using whether your debit or your credit card. Credit card is a whole other kettle of fish. For credit cards, my advice to persons is treat your credit card as anything that you're going to charge on it must be something that you can pay back in 30 days. If you can't pay it back in 30 days, don't charge it.
