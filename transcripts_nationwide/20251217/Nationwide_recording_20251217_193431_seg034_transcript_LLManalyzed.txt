20251217 193431 Thank you very much. I will take another question, if there is one from the floor. Yes, thank you very much. Identify and direct. Sure. Nicholas Key from Key Farms. I guess this is for Dr. Taylor or Professor Taylor. I was more curious, at least deep diving into your work, if you are thinking about the variables related to climate change in the context of ecosystem services, and if you are, how are you then including things like biodiversity data in your assessment for how our nature-based assets are being reported on, especially for different funds like the Loss and Damage Fund. Prof. Taylor?
