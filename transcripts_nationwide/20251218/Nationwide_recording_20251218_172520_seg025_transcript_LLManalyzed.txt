We bore things off with some cricket as at sports time, New Zealand are 344-1 on day 2 of the third test at the Bee Oval. The batsmen at the crease are Devon Conway on 184 and night watchman Jacob Duffy on 9. Kimah Roach, the lone wicket-taker thus far, captured the wicket of Captain Tom Latham on 134 on yesterday's opening day. Roach was unable to take to the field on the second day as he suffered a hamstring strain on the opening day.
