20251215 093727 You're wrong. If you can't look at your friends and say you're wrong, that means you're a wimp, you're a hypocrite. That doesn't mean your friend is not good, because if your friend is not doing wrong, you can't tell them what they're wrong. My friend is not going to do it publicly, because your friend can't walk on the road. And somebody says, what's wrong, man, what's wrong? And make people go up on him. You might try to defend him publicly, but when it comes in, you say, no, big man, you're wrong, you know? What you do? What's wrong? Because what I remember, after the hurricane visit Jamaica, the first country to send supplies to Jamaica was Venezuela, who said, well, that's 10, 20 ton of really supplies to the country. The same day came on command board, but the first country to supply Jamaica with relief was Venezuela.
