20251226 132210 I'm all strung out, my heart is fried I just can't get you off my mind Cause your love, your love, is my drug So we back in the club with the bodies rockin' from side to side Here we go! Yeah, suddenly, we all got our heads up. No control on my body. Ain't I seen you before? I think I remember, though. Ice, ice, ice, ice. Cause baby, check my eyes. Oh, dear, you got us falling in love again.
