Welcome back to boy things after dark with me Kareem boy at things They don know, it's a Wednesday night and this is what we do 8 to 11 p.m. each and every Wednesday right here on Nationwide 90 FM. So if you're just joining us, the topic of the night is who comes first, the wife, the girlfriend or the mom? And our question of the night is if a man chooses his mother over his wife or girlfriend, does that automatically make him a mama's boy? So we'll get into all of that and we'll get into the discussion and I would definitely love to hear from some of you guys tonight on your take on this because it was a conversation that I was having with my team prior to the show
