She just waiting on the call. They call her to tell her. Well, after that, she didn't hear from them. She called them back. They told her, you know, something wasn't completed on the farm and she have to go sign over the farm or she have to come in. They can't fix it for her. It was a very simple thing. Long story short, she waited months to get her title and when she couldn't wait on a call any longer and went to the office, decided she wasn't leaving without her title. The receptionist told her the title is just not there.
