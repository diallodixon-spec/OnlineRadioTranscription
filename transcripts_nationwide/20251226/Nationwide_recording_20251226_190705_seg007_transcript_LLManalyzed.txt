20251226 190705 Why did you leave me to cry? Oh my baby Bad times that I've passed you by You could see the teardrops rolling down my eyes Why did you leave me to cry? Oh my baby, I wanted you to be a bride And forever you would stay by my side Why did you leave me to cry, oh my honey? Why, why did you leave me for another man?
