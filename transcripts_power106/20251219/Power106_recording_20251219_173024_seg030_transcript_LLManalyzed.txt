For 2026, I think our greatest focus is going to be taking the events to the people, but also letting the masses know the amazing entertainment that's going on in Dexterity because we have a great product. Every time we host an event, usually at the exit gate when people are leaving i'm like how did you find the event and everybody's amazed everybody loves it um the the persons who are like new to it and coming for the first and like yo when is the next one coming yeah yeah yeah it's a certain energy you know so there's a certain buzz of a vibe, an energy, it wakes you up. It does, it does. It wakes you up. So what I really want to do for 2026 is to get more people to be aware of this. Come and introduce, because you don't know what you don't know. Yeah.
