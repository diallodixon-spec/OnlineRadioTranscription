20251229 202417 Don't try to take me to a disco You'll never even get me out on the floor In ten minutes I'll be late for the door I like that old-time rock and roll Still like that old time rock and roll That kind of music just soothes the soul I reminisce about the days of old With that old-timer rockin' roll I'm gonna hear him play a tango I'd better hear some blues or funky also There's only one sure way to get me to go Stop playing old-time rock'n'roll Call me a rat or call me what you wish
