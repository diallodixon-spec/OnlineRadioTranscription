20251225 190808 Christmas time. Silver bells. Silver bells. Soon it'll be Christmas in the ghetto. Let me hear you sing it louder. Christmas is coming now. Everyone gonna our dance is rocking to this Christmas song. Let me walk you down, let me skype you, to the Christmas melody. Because it's last Christmas time in the ghetto. Ra-a-a-ki-ki-a-a, i-i-i-i, a-a-a.
