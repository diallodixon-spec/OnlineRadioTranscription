20251218 121412 I want everybody to have a happy holiday now and stay good in a God blessing no matter what you can find that is your happiness that is your dinner because sometimes the big things don't count but the little things it is a blessing once you put it with God it is a blessing to you and your family so whatever you can find give God thanks give him thanks and be satisfied thank him when you get up you see So whatever you can find, give God thanks. Give him thanks and be satisfied. Thank him. When you get up, you see the day, you get up each morning and say thank you Lord. Thank you for the strength because many in the hospital cannot do nothing for their self. But you can say thank you Jesus. You can go there. You can go to the bathroom by yourself. Give God thanks. Thank him for your family, thank Him for your life, thank Him for all who ruin you, maybe good or bad. But thank Him because the air, you have to say almost close. Just a couple weeks, then we're going into the other air. So we have to give God thanks, thank Him for life.
