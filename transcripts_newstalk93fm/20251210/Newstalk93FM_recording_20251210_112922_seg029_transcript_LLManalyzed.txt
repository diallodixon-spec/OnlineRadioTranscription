============================================================

babies, I said no that is not an excuse. I have two children too. One of my child is on the autism spectrum. So that means it requires greater assistance and it requires greater financial obligations. But I have a dream and I always tell myself that I want to achieve my full potential where education is concerned so that I can give back to my community, give back to my family. And I'm pushing to achieve my dreams. Excellent. Rosetta, you actually talk about family in a big way. How is mom and dad? Mom and dad around and how are they accepting this? I must be very proud of you. Well, unfortunately, I must say that my biological mom and dad, they are late. They are not around at this time.
