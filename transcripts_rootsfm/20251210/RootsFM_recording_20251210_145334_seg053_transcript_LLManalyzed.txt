No, you should never give your love away When the winter comes around And there's nobody there to keep you warm Call me on your phone line And I will be there in a no time I'll be there to warm you up I'll be there, to warm you up That's why I say no, you should never Give your love away when springtime comes around and when the roses are bursting out of the ground call me on your phone line and i will be there in a no time i'll be there to warm you up i'll be there to warm you up. I'll be there To warm you up. It's my little girlie. No, you should never give your love away. When summertime comes around. When the humidity comes around.
