============================================================

To be kind and gentle to each other. To do your best when it's asked of you. To do what you have to do when you're supposed to. You've got to feel, you've got to feel the soul and there, you don't look stick. Fling your water, see, and then the shark don't see. That shaggy, the yak, and then the yak not grab. And you take a little rub off of your belly, because you just a up on a puff, that's yak.
