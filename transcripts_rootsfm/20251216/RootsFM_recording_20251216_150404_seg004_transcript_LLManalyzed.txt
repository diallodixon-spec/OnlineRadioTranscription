So you're on the job like right now, Janelle? Well, I just got off the job, but yes. So you're at home right now? Yeah. And where you at? Mona. You're in maybe about 20 minutes now. So, you're keeping yourself warm and dry? Yes sir, you already know. Don't want to wet up your feet, eh? No, no. I like that. So Christmas coming up next week. What else are the things we'll be doing to make that day a special day?
