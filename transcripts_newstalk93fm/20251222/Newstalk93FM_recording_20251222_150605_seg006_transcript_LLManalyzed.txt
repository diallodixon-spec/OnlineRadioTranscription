20251222 150605 I can never do bad things when you do so you never do that Money in your pocket so you're never too sad Boy, if money make you dance You'll be dancing forever To the beat of a drum that's never to help you But now you hear this story Is you flex with me Like I do you something Like I do you somethin' When I hear this show now Is you flex? Like I do the wrong thing. Like I do you something. Oh, it's a good, good thing. I ain't a good, good spirit. I drink in a good, good spirits. Big eyes right up to the limit. So don't hold me down. Don't fight me.
