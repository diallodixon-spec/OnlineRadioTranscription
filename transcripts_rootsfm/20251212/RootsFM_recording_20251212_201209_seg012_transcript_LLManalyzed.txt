20251212 201209 You will always be your everything to me soon Hurry back and bring the sun Let me be your one and only one Cause just one stops the rain from the sky And the tears from my eyes From falling onto my face Rolling down my cheek Honey, it's rolling down Can't you see it, baby? Rolling down Wedding up my silk shirt Rolling down It's rolling down my cheek, and I don't know where to go.
