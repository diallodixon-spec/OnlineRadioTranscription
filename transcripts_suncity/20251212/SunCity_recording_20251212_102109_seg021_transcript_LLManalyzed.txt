20251212 102109 The money and the fame made us all change places. How could it be through the misery that came to pass? The hard times make a true friend afraid to ask for currency. But you can run to me when you need and I never leave. Honestly, someone to believe in as you can see. It's a small thing to a truth. What could I do? Real homies help you get through. And come anew, he'd do the same thing if he could. Because in the hood, true homies make you feel good. And after times, we'd be acting up. Call the cops. Bringing a seizure to the peace that we've made together. Once again, I sit here in the time. Till the end of time, till the end of time. Please don't forgive me for my life I said. My heart still seem to scare all my sisters here. So you know I don't hang around in the house much this whole night.
