20251216 180907 Sing this song To pass the time away Driving in my car Driving home for Christmas It's gonna take some time But I'll get there Top to toe in tailbacks Oh, I got red lights all around Soon there'll be a freeway Get my feet on holy ground So I sing for you Though you can't hear me when I get through Oh, I feel you near me Driving in my car I'm driving home for Christmas
