20251225 123718 This is Tannis Marson aka Soul Child Tannis and you are listening to Sun City Radio. Radio with a difference rebuilding Jamaica. The beat of the drum, the strumming of the bass guitar, the unison of the keyboard, the steadiness of the rhythm guitar, energy from the percussion and the voice cementing the sound. This is reggae music, the coming together of souls uniting the world in harmony and peace. Anything you want, you can get it when you come back here.
