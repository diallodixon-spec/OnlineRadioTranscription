20251231 194241 running on for his share of the money. The ninth and the final event, field of twelve, the bird here, nine furloughs and twenty-five yards is the journeys and overnight allowance and this is the final appreciation day trophy and share delight. Another American to be written by Christopher Mamdean looks like a very nice top rated, no question about it. So, if he runs up to anything near to his best form, he'll win it. There is number three, Brenda Boyle, always running on, and I think has excellent prospects of arriving in time, and then there's Sistine Treasure. Another American, she's an American male from the camp of Gary Sabrati, they end things up. Looks likely to run well. So based on my selection there, I'm expecting the Americans to do particularly well. All right, just a couple of minutes here. And just to keep one of my promises, as I said, I'll tell you about how the American horses fared.
