The Prime Minister needs to get this up as the Finance Minister could come to the Parliament and tell the country what is it that she's doing in order to inspire the confidence that would be necessary to have the financial recovery. Stop hiding her. This is over a month and everybody asks what is happening to the Finance Minister. No plan, no discussions, no approach to the IMF yet. We don't know what she's doing. I saw somebody saying, wondering if she's not well. We see her out of country a day with the World Bank people. And she was talking about AI? Yeah, precisely. Last week, Sunday. Talking about everything that she shouldn't be talking about and avoiding the things that she should be talking about. So you can have recovery without those things Prime Minister. The most phenomenal recovery. Talking alone is not going to help. The most phenomenal reconstruction. That's a lot of work.
