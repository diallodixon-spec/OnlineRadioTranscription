============================================================

Every time, every time, every time From the time I taste a sip, I'm ready to go Go-o-o-o, we go go-o-o And from the time that liquor hit, I just need some more More, more, more, more It's a bottle and spoon and a cup in me hand And I'm whining up on me man Everybody focus is jam, jam, jam When we leave home that take a trip I feel like whining, like whining Oh, oh, oh And every time I shout, I say I feel like a lightning Like a lightning, oh I've been thinking about you, baby Will you let it turn me crazy, baby?
