According to the utility regulator, the 7% increase represents an additional $650 on a typical $9,000 bill. This will reflect on the bills issued in December 2025. It reflects consumption in November for customers who are currently receiving electricity supply. The OUR says the increase stems primarily from higher electricity generation costs after JPS was forced to rely on more expensive fuel sources. This was a result of natural gas supplies becoming unavailable in the period leading up to and immediately following Hurricane Melissa. The hurricane also triggered an estimated 30% reduction in the electricity sales, compounding the impact on the fuel and independent power producer components of customer bills.
