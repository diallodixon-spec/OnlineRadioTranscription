Could you please mention a few more initiatives that Andrew Honest has implemented to promote equal opportunity? I'm not defending any party but this government has done more than any other to help, although much more needs to be done. When you see when people say they're not defending any party, that's a red flag to me, particularly given your opening dialogue. You also say that about Nationwide, I've never heard the station defend anything untrue from either side, and that Vinnie's talking rubbish. That was a long one. Do you realize that Manley was more grounded in the future than Andrew? The best policies we have today are because of his efforts 50 years ago, and Andrew, the young independence leader, doesn't see the need for trust.
