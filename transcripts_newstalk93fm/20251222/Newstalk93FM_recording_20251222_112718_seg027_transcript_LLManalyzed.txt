20251222 112718 that's just what i seek to find oh yeah i ain't in the mood i just need some solitude oh gosh but everybody's trying you just leave me See what I'm trying to say is that this caused me so much pain Feeling like I've got no control over my own brain And it's sad to see that you don't see it's driving me insane Leave me alone, oh yes
