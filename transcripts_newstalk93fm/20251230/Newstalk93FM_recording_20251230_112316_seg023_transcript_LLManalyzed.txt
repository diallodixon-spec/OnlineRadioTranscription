Deep as the blue sea. Nice and easy, so deeply we submerge under this emotion. Like an anchor, you keep me safe. I'm not afraid of the ocean. I keep you warm and cozy. You'll be coming on me arms when the storm's approaching. So why panic? When all of us think like the titanic, the lighthouse, we are where I fall in. Deep as the sea, your love's flowing into me And even though the waves are rough, this love is tough, just love me Deep as the blue, deep as the blue sea
