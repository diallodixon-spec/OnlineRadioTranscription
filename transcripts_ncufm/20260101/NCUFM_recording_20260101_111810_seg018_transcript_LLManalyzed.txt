20260101 111810 We don't rest on flesh and blood, but principalities of the dark. We too are marching to one week, rushing the enemy under our feet. We are mighty in our stand, with God's a sword and shield. Lord our God is the sword and shield. We are united in Jesus Christ. We are the soldiers of the light. We don't wrestle flesh and blood, but principleities of the dark. We too are marching together.
