20251217 201815 Who do you define gratitude? All right. For me, gratitude is being thankful for... I almost want to say everything, but it's kind of hard to be thankful for everything. But for me, gratitude is just being thankful, one, for having the opportunity to be able to experience something, to go through it, to know good or bad, it makes an impact on me, and that is up to me to make the best of it. So being thankful for whatever happens in my life, knowing that if it happens, then there are ways that I can gain from it, learn from it, and make the best of it. So being thankful for everything that happens, good or bad. That is gratitude. I see, I see.
