You're listening to Sleek Radio, 93 FM. You come alive with one wine, baby. With you, I want to dance the night away. One jam, turn a lifetime, baby. So don't feel away. You don't like the fast life. They look on the bright side, girl. take the blame I just want you come and bite it up, just a little winding up Come and meet me behind the truck and we rev it up Whole day, keep throwing it back, I know why you stop
