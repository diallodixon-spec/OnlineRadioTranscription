I feel dynamite Every time, every time, every time I feel more, little more So I could forget every pain that is on my mind And if you pour a little more, then you could be sure I'll be having a damn good time Is a feeling that I really can't describe In a sovereign heritage Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah Every time I take a trip I I feel like whining, like whining. And every time I shout, I think, I feel like lying, like lying. Don't want to be inside, don't wanna be outside tonight Do you wait until you know for sure I have been a good time? Blast my head little tight, I feel dynamite Every time, every time, every time yeah, single time Everybody start your job now
