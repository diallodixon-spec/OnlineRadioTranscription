20251225 215343 In the south, hearts on the ground, freaks when I squeeze, what do you need? You want a break? I ain't in space, ready to take you around the way, so you ready to hear me? Might talk this, cause I ain't dead yet, I'm a cloneless, need you safe, cause it's cool in the case, ready just getting locked up Being frazzled by the words I've chucked So once again, it's kickin' it's rock I'm screwin' everything, you're just the rock I walk through the walls, I think I'm hit If you wanna step to the middle, I'll hit my head Most of it is wild, I'm into the crowd on just for the ride I'm off the wall, I'm A.I.S. If you wanna step to it, I'll whack you in my head Busting is wild, you can tell I'm a bribe That ain't just 20, I'm from the south Be a god, take your mind Get ready for the heat It's like you're owning it You can't let me go
