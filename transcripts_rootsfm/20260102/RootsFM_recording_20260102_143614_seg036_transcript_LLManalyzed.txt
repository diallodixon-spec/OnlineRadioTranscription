Don't know how it feels But I know I'm not afraid And if she's one day over That means she's overage And if she is one day under That means she's underage Don't give me no overage love Love Don't give me overage love Now it's so hard to find someone Who's exactly your age But I would rather to search For the rest of my days When I fall in love I don't want to be afraid So I want someone Who's exactly my age Don't give me no over-age love Don't give me over-age love Cause when you find the one you love
