20251225 130305 I just want you here tonight, holding on to me so tight. What more can I do? All I want for Christmas is you You All the lights are shining so brightly everywhere And the sound of children's laughter fills the air And everyone is singing I hear those sleigh bells ringing Sally won't you bring me the one I really need Please bring my baby to me
