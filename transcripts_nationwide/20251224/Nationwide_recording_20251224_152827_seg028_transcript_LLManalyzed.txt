20251224 152827 That's my favorite so far. I like this one. You know what, you're doing really good. Thanks for having me, but's a funny person. She's hilarious. First of all, why am I getting a peak week? You know what I mean? I love me some Macadamon, man. Oh my God! Macar! Macadoshis! Maca, please! Maca, say a good thing to practice to eat pepper. That should be funny. The trailer alone is funny so I can imagine. Anyway, Maka Diamond said she chose to dedicate the episode to Hurricane Recovery after witnessing the storm's impact first hand.
