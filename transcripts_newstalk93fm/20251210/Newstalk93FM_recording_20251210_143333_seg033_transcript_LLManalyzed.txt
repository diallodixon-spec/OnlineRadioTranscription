She only do what she know Weakens, get it poppin' on the low Better days comin' for sure This world If it was up to me I wouldn't give if nobody's no sympathy I'd take away the pain, I'd give you everything I just wanna see, wanna see If this world were mad When you ride it slow Maybe you would stop, strike close And I'm with you, everything goes I'm coming for that, on my soul Riding clown, risk fall Checked out, on the way home This world, concrete, flowers grow Hard days, she only doin' what she know Weekends, get it poppin' on the low Better days comin' for sure
