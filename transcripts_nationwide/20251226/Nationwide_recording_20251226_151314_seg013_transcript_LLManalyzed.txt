20251226 151314 You had me in the palm of your hand So why your love went away? I just can't seem to understand Thought it was me and you, baby Me and you until the end But I guess I was wrong Don't wanna think about it Don't wanna talk about it I'm just so sick about it I can't believe it's ending this way I'm just so confused about it Feeling the blues about it I just can't do it without you Tell me, is this fair? Is this the way it's really going down? Is this how we say goodbye? Should I know better when you came around? That you were gonna make me cry? It's breaking my heart to watch you run around Cause I know that you're living a lie But that's okay baby cause in time you will find I'm frozen down, frozen down, frozen out I'm falling back around
