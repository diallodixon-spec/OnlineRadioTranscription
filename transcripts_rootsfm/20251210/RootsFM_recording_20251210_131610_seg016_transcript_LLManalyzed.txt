old faces who used to greet everyone will be there dancing all night long we're doing it all night Saturday night that just all night to the broad daylight all night Saturday night we're doing it tonight to the broad daylight put on your best dress the sweetest perfume Tonight we'll be loving in ecstasy Come on, come on, baby Say you'll go with me, let's do it all right Why does my heart go on beating? why does the sea rush to shore? Don't they know it's the end of the world And you don't love me anymore?
