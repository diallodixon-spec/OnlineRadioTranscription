But let me put this to you, and this is again another issue I have with America, and it's silence and acceptance of Trump's tirade about the legal, by the way, immigrants from Somalia living in the United States, largely in Minnesota. I think that's where the greatest size of the immigrant population is. Imagine a little boy or girl, either of Somalian descent, or just a black girl or a black boy living in Minnesota. They hear they're president of the United States, and I say they're president because even if they are immigrants, they are now legal immigrants, and that means they are now Americans. And they hear their president saying that these people are garbage. And then he focuses on Congresswoman Omar and says she's garbage. Imagine what they would think to themselves.
