keep it simple. And that's a good advice for life too, you know, keep it simple. Yes, yes. So, we are here and we are here, we are here. How are you two live family? I hope all of you had a great weekend. I know for some of you, it was work. Yes. It's a working weekend. A lot of the folks here and in the diaspora have a job more than one thing. So, it's always work. But I hope you found a good time to relax and reflect and enjoy. Yeah, you have to. You have to eke out that little time to get some relaxation in there and a little rest if you can. That's why you're going to give it a weekend. I know that a lot of people are under strain now to try and make something of the year, especially here in Jamaica, where we're just going through a kind of a tailspin, not quite sure how the year is going to end, which is why I said I'm just trying to lift the spirit because you have to try and end the year positively.
