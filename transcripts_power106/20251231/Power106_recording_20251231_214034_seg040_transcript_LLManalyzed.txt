20251231 214034 But the devil is no friend of mine I've given you a chance to love me But you wanna waste my time If you want to meet You gotta take me as I am Cause I've accepted you for what you are And if you need me You gotta try to understand You shouldn't try to change me, love me as I am You've been trying to make me over, yes The way I talk, the way I wear my hair But if changing me, what's on your mind? Then girl, you're just a wasting time. Ooh girl, I'll be just fine. So if you want to me, you've got to take me inside.
