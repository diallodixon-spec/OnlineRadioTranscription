20251230 174625 Isis Miller with Ruth Salaji, which is the in-week thriller from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. Sorry, sir, it never got to our weekend. We have food for thought. Your health is well, then love, boss. Love, boss. That is a must. And a idiot, idiot, idiot thing that they will close it off at the end of the week with Fire Friday, which are the talk of the street. Ruth Salaji, me say ya, Ruth Salaji. It's 30 minutes of emotions becoming world. It buzzes into performance through poetry. Here poets express themselves using the spoken word and be inspired by their process of thought. Biden verse with me Dion Davies.
