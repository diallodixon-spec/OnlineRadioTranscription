20251224 161513 As a matter of fact, I think the issue of responsible drinking will be the topic of discussion for the auto world a bit later on with Shelly Ann McLagan. I understand she'll be speaking with the head of corporate affairs for Red Stripe, Diane Ashton-Smith. We'll be joining Shelly and McLagan at 5.15 this afternoon on The Auto World, this issue of responsible drinking this time of the year, Cirrus. Let's take a break here, more after this. You're listening to Power 106 FM. The time is now 4.15.
