20251223 121613 God bless you. To the faithful listeners to you out there in Radioland, God bless you. God bless you. Happy Kwanzaa. Thank you, thank you, thank you. It's a good vibe, it's a good vibe. So we go right into the sanctuary right now. We just had Pastor Turnbull and we go sanctuary right now and then coming up at approximately 1230 we have news, we have sports, we have international news and weather. It's rainy out there. And as a matter of fact, that's why Pastor Turnbull, a 10-minute escape from the challenges of life and the cares of the world.
