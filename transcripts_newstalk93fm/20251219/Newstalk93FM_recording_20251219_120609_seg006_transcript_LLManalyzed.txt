I'm not gonna be home tonight. I not coming home tonight is a drunk in the party. So why don't you go self-party to find me? I was in love by the melodies. Now the liquor take all of me. And the bass knock my soul out. And my chest so calm won't let me leave. I don want to know, tell them. You can find me out on the road. I'm ready to walk. Chest up, walk. Time to free up. God, I won't let me go. Go send a search party to find me. I'll turn the road on line. Tell them that this hookah have me. They will see me.
