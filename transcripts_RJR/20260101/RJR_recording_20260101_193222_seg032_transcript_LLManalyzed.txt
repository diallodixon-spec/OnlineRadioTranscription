We are blessed as a nation with faith in Almighty God, blessed with belief in one another, blessed with the support of our families, our friends, our diaspora, and our regional and international partners. But above all, our greatest strength lies within us, our willingness to work together, to stay the course, and to build back better for generations to come. Our motto is, out of many people let us live these words not only in speech but in action and as one people let us recover. As one people let us move forward.
