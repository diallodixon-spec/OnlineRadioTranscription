I'm leaving, please believe in He and the brother of my feelings Checking out the lockers as I'm in the booth I'll prove my worth as I'm being No deceiving, nothing else, I'm leaving No teasing, I need you to hear a book full of dance Don't give me what he has control Cause I feel like dusting loose and I feel like touching you
