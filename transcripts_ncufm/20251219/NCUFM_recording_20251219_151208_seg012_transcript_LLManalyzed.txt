20251219 151208 Oh, yes, Lord, you are holy. Lord, give us our life. Oh, yes, lord, you are holy, we give you all the glory. The angels bow down to carry your majesty. Demons tremble at the sound of your name. You're higher than mighty, Lord of glory. You're faster and brighter than the morning star. You came to us from the hell with every young man just here. Demons trouble and don't start a war game. The fire I'm burning, the god I'm longing, the lights I'm burning, I'm burning now.
