20251229 110606 All I wanna do is just explain Why do we feel the way we do? What a joy to share with you A leader in strife tonight is pain If anymore I need to say the list goes on and on all day. I'll cherish that moment for life. And I know it might sound crazy. It's all right, take a seat, hold tight. Time to admit it. Time to shut admit it. I'm so addicted to you. You've taken my heart and showed me the right way. No doubt about it.
