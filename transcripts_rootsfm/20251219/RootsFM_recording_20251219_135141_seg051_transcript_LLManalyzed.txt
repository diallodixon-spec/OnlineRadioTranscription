As long as you take me. Love me for real. I promise you hear me calling your name over and over again. I'm just searching, searching for the truth. I know my heart belongs to you. I'm not in this just for her. She's still loving me. Though I've caused her so much pain I've done my share of wrong, my share of wrong Time and time again
