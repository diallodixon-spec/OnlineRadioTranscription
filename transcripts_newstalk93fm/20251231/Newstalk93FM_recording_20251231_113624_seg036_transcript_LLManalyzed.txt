20251231 113624 I feel your frequency from miles away. You come alive with one wine, baby. With you, I want to dance the night away. One jump in a lifetime, baby. So don't feel away. You don't like the fast life. on the bright side I go take the blame I just want you come and light it up Just a little winding up Come and meet me behind the truck and we rev it up Whole day keep throwing it back I know why you stop Baby no way We could post up all the pictures you want when you're ready. I go over here, darling. You go over there. But we could meet in the middle and start a bacchanal. Play in the middle, hey. What we gonna do now?
