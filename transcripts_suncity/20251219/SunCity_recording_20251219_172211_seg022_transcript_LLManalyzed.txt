We can go wherever, so let's do it now or never, baby. Nothing's ever, ever too far. Glitter in the sky, glitter in our eyes, shining just the way we are. I feel like we're forever every time we get together, but whatever, let's be lost for more. You want me? I want you, my sugar boo I'm meditating, the Milky Way We're renegades, yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah I got you, moonlight, you're my starlight I need you, all night, come on dance with me
