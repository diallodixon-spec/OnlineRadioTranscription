20251229 135132 I heard that you were hurting That you were suffering pain But I didn't dare just turn my head And look the other way For when your heart is aching My heart is aching too Let me help you bear your burden That's the least that I can do I'll be standing in the gap for you Just remember someone somewhere Is praying for you Calling out your name Praying for your strength I'll be standing in your way
