20251230 175544 And I can't break through There's no talking to you It's so sad that you leave it It takes time to believe it But after all I said and done You're gonna be my only one, oh You believe in life but for love I can feel inside me say Really don't think you're strong enough now We believe in love after love Tired and weak, so I went home to sleep. I work all day. Dear God, I'm weak. There was my baby looking so sweet, just thinking of you.
