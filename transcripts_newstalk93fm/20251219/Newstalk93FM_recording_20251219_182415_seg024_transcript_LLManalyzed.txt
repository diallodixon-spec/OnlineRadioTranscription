20251219 182415 Whenever I'm broken, you make me feel whole Whenever I'm lonely, you're there for my soul Wherever you are, girl, that's where I call my own Whenever you doubt it, I'll be letting you know I want to be dancing with you forever You see through the storm and take me as I am. Maybe it's magic and intent that we're together. I make I just love you and hold you for my hand. Hold you for my hand, yeah, yeah, yeah. Hold you from my hand, hold you from my hand. Over and over again, yeah my love is burning babe Feels like time is frozen and the night is for us We're alone again, every moment's calling you
