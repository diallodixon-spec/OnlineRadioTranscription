20251230 141713 This Christmas, as Jamaica continues to recover from Hurricane Melissa, we're reminded of our greatest strengths, our love and resilience. In every community, in every act of care and rebuilding, that strength is on display. Vision 2030 Jamaica provides a roadmap for a secure, prosperous, and sustainable future. Together, we rebuild communities, restore hope, and move forward with confidence. Jamaica, the place of choice to live, work, raise families and do business. Merry Christmas, Jamaica.
