It's like steroids, boy I get my doses From all kinds of sources And all now, them still can't kill me now You see, as them sink me on the high floor Right down the storm, them just like a boat So as they box me down, so I get up They have to wonder how others get up And every crack I see, I just see through And by the help of all, they just get through I just won't stop I feel like Because what don't kill you should make you stronger so my problems is like I get my doses from all kinds of sources
