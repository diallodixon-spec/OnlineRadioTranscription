So Mr. Breaks, what role does diet and lifestyle play in the high rates of chronic illnesses we see in black populations? And I know that's a big question, but do your best to... It's a very easy question. The answer is 100%. Now, one thing I'm gonna do, because we've had this debate, we get into this debate all the time here in America, right? Because of the things we say about food, right? And about lifestyle. And it's funny, that documentary you were talking about, we may have to share it with the listeners, is that people feel the culture is under attack, right when we talk about the history of black food, Caribbean food, African American food, even West African food, African food in general, it's not the culture. We've had our culture. Yes, it's been bastardized and twisted about.
