to get money out of what we have and go put it back in the coffee. That doesn't make sense. The price we get is not allowing me to even cure the coffee during the time before the storm. Then there will come nothing for the coffee farmer. We don't get no help. And then put the price of the coffee at $10,000 back. And when we don't repower coffee, a $1,000 goes on. During the election, they come up and put on a thousand dollars. And then after the election and the coffee start up at this crap, at ten thousand dollars, they carry it back still. So I ain't never get none of eleven thousand dollars. Michael, let me get some of the eleven thousand dollars. You understand? And when you float a box of coffee, you're not getting a box, a three quarter, you'll get $750 and I have to pay the people $2,500 to pick a box of coffee. Some pay $3,000, I could do that. I have to do most of the picking myself. You understand?
