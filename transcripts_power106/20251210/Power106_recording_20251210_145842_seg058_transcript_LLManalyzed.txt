Before you go, we have a couple of minutes. Talk to me a bit about the industrial landscape at the time, industrial relations landscape at the time that Michael Manley was active in it. You gave us one story a while ago that, you know, you just ensure that the car is parked with the back in, so if we need to move, we can just move quick. Give me a bit more on that, the landscape at the time. Let me say that it was far more competitive. You had the BITU, you had the NW, you had the TUC. It was far more competitive and you had a lot of giants. When you look at the public sector, there was a gentleman called Patrick Kelly. There's no other person I know in Jamaica, not even Michael, who speaks a language.
