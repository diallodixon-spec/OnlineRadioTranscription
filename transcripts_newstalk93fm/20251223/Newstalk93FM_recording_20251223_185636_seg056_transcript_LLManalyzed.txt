20251223 185636 I'm not faking this. I'm not fooling you. You see these feelings, I'm not catching. I'm a question fit, I'ma shine your ego bright. For like F, what did I do? No, no, no. Ah, I feel nasty, yeah. If I broke down, my business, I'll shine your ego bright, yeah, yeah. For like F what did I do, yeah. F-I-N-E-S-S-E, if it be the reason why your papa want to jealous me. If he want to take I'm serious, I'll do tough speed. No need to resonate, I'm on a different frequency. I don't think it's necessary. I be damned if there's somebody that could do like me. Man, I be like Mo Salah coming up the right wing. I call to your defender, you don't need to tell me. I'm a finesse. You know same here, I'm a snitch.
