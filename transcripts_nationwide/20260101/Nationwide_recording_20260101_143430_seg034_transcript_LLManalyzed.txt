20260101 143430 I love the way you hold me in Your arms at nights and whisper words that melt me inside oh my and when you touch my face your fingers grip my waist i'm tempted to put my lips on your chocolate brown skin i'm so excited can't fight it can't hide it It's a crazy night Like a baby, sweet candy, I'm addicted So give me some love Another morning, another evening Hold me up while you're in there, love
