20251225 204220 I can't tell you what's in store I don't know a lot of things I don't have all the answers to the questions of life That I know in whom I have believed And he knows my name Every step that I take Every move that I make Every tear that I cry He knows my name When I'm overwhelmed by the pain Can't see the light of day I know I'll be just fine Cause he knows my name He knew who I was when he carried my corpse
