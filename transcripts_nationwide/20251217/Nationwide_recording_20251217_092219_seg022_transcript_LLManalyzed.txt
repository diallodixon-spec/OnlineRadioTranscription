20251217 092219 Repeat that number for us. Alright, that's it from me Mr. Sweeney. Is there anything else that you'd like to add about the National Energy Poverty Reduction Project or JSAFE's overall efforts in hurricane recovery? Yeah, just to say, I mean, that's one of these programs. So we will continue to support farmers who are affected and small tourism enterprises under our Ready 2 project. And so farmers who lost inputs, lost infrastructure can do the same. Our Ready 2 project is also providing support. There are schools that we're working with, the Ministry of Education to get those back on stream. And we will also be still carrying out the social services programs in the communities where we work. So if there are situations out there we need to know about, certainly reach out.
