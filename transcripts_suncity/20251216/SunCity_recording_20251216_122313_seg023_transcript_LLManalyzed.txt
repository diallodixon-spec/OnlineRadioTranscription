20251216 122313 I don't want crazy bones. In other words, you know what I'm gonna say? One crazy bone make them know! Now they don't like fear, it's growing in their eyes The mood of a fire, set up it down, down upon their eyes The love of them makes you blue, to find the exercise show The cake a run on them, no more we get the skies Now they don't love me, see I get to use the rice And if we don't want to give them to you, they mend it, mend it They ma go rise now, careful the love of them, cause they ma hypocrite
