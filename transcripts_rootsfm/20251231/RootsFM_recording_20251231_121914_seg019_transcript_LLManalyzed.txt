Jesus wants a response from us today. He wants us to hear Him, to understand His radical teaching, and then to make a choice to follow Him. He wants us to follow Him with a passion and zeal to believe in everything He teaches and to radically change our lives as a result. And if we will not change, then Jesus' Word will challenge us and evoke us to respond. Today, pay attention, make a choice, be committed.
