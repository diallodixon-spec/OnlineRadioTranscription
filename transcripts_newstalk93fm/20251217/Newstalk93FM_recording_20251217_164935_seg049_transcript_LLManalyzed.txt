I never wanna say goodbye This love that I'm feeling gives me life On top of like a runaway train in the night I don't to go to sleep. I won't take a break. This symphony is so real. It's so real. When you speak to me, I hear a song. Every word you say feels like a poem. i will take you with me everywhere listen to you every day must be motivation no i just want to share it with you
