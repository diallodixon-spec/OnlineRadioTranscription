to your church or to some community or some some NGO or some other faith-based organization but you are robbed of that by virtue of the law because the law says if you have no relatives then it ends up pretty much in the crowd. There's an exception with this though and it would be say for example there's this person in the community and the person can't help him or herself and you have a neighbor who goes and assist the person all the time and so on, but there are no other relatives. If the person dies, then that person who is assisting can apply for a waiver of the Crown's right and get that property. There is a way in which a person can get that property. All right thank you very much for that and then how long does it normally take?
