20251224 212717 I'd swim the seas, climb mountains still Islander Ride on a breeze to get next to you, you, you There's nothing that I won't go through And nothing that I wanna do Wake up to a dream, you make every wish come true And in a silent night so close Another sky, you and I Where the stars dance with the moonlight You and I, what we got? Oh, we got love We got la la la la la love Oh, we got us We got love, it's Christmas We got love, we got la-la-la-love Oh, we got us, we got love this Christmas Meet me in the morning up like the sun with kisses so sweet You're my hot chocolate sweet candy, can't let me be your treat
