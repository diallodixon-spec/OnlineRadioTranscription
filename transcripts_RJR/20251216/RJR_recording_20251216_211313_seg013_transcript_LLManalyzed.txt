20251216 211313 I think the way in which I approach him, kind of panic him, freeze him, so to speak. Come out and say hi, sir, how are you? I just go out and rush him. I really want to commend you, and one of the things about it, because in Jamaica today, I know sometimes we have a way where we tend to be so insular. We are into ourselves, we're focusing only on ourselves, we don't want business with our neighbor, we're not looking right, we not looking left. Once it is that it don't concern us directly, we bury our heads and say, no, I'm not getting involved. So I want to commend you for getting involved in the way in which you did and as I said at the beginning of the program, for thwarting what could otherwise have been a very tragic situation. So I commend you publicly sir.
