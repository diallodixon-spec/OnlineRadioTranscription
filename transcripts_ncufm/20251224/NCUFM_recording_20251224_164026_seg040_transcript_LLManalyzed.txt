When I'm weak, he delivers When I'm low, he delivers I know he delivers me When I'm low in my spirit, when I'm weak I know I know I know When I'm hungry, I know he delivers Me over and over Wish I'll have a new name in that land In that land, that sunny, sunny land New name, precious name In that sunny land Sign me up, sign me up For the Christian Jubilee Write my name, write my name on the road Cause I've been changed
