20251231 140002 called in 2025. Thanks to Celise Pinnock, our technical engineer, early run stabbing Thomas, our producer, and thanks above all to all of you who've been part of the program for this year. I thank you for that. It's time to say goodbye and we say goodbye to a breaking of hours. Donald Oliver. Goodbye and rest in peace. The time is now.
