20260102 183624 It was very difficult for me. I could not wait to see the back of 2025, to be honest with you, Leon. I wanted 2025 to leave because there were so many people who died as well, people who I've known over the years. There was too many mishaps. I couldn't deal with 2025 after a while. And even with this Jamaica universe, young lady going on stage, falling off stage, being in ICU for so long, Jamaica losing, football. I mean, we had so many losses. It was a very hard year for us emotionally. Yeah.

Yeah, two of my two sisters almost.
