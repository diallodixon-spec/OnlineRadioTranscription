20251216 213621 Oh You're pretty ladies around the world Got a weird thing to show you So tell all the boys and girls Tell your brother, your sister, and your mama too Cause we're about to throw down And you'll know just what to do Wave your hands in the air like you don't care Fly by the people as they start to look and stare. Do your dance, do your dance. Do your dance quick, mama. Come on, baby, tell me, what's the word? Wait up. If we fight, say, when you hear the call.
