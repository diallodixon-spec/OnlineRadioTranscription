20251230 121816 If your hand causes you to sin, cut it off. It is better for you to enter into life maimed than with two hands to go into jahannam, into the unquenchable fire. And if your foot causes you to sin cut it off, it is better for you enter into life crippled than with two feet to be thrown into Jai Annam. And if your eyes causes you to sin, pluck it out. Mark chapter 9 verse 43 to 47. The theme for today will be value freedom.
