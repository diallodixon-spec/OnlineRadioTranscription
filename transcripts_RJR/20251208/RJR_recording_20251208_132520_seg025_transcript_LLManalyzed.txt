if I didn't think about, you know, what, what, oh, you know, this could do, this could do. But another day, we're there. Yes, above ground, have to give thanks. Yeah, man, it's that really, that's a really, really sobering thought, you know? We're there. We're here. We're there. So love it. Love it, love it, love it. You know know you have to find the joy in the simple things. You see a man push, you know you have a tire, you roll the tire, so you just walk and push the tire. And he come expertly down the road, you know. I say oh man, this nice here. And then the tire just decides to have a mind of its own. I see the tire go so whoop and it's like he might say wait. Like you catch him off guard and he start run down the tire just decides to have a mind of its own, you know. I see the tire go so whoop and it's like he might say, wait. Like he catch him off guard and he start run down the tire and the tire goes for me and say, no, this is too much. I said, look how this one start up nice and cool, man. Like a donna go down the road. And the tire of him now like one clap.
