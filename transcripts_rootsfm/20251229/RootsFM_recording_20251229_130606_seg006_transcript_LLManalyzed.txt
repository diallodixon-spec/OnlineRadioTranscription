20251229 130606 My destiny Teach me thy ways, O Jah, I will always walk in thy truth. Teach me a path to praise thee, and to fear thy name. Blessed are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy. Consider my affliction, no chance, and deliver me. Control me, just control me. Just control me, oh, oh, oh. Just control me.
