20260102 152517 I don't need a rich to somebody that can make me feel safe. Yeah. Look, I don't want a couple, but nobody ever made me feel safe like you. Because when I'm with you, I just know I'm this. I feel it right at home, safe in your arms, baby, come hold me down. Come hold me down, huh? Save like a key and a lock on me. Save like a crib with a combo, please. Hold you down. Hold you down, down, down. I can put my guard down. I can pull my heart out. Love you around, huh? Unplug the alarm.
