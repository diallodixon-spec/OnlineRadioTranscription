20260101 130101 Now this mountain I must climb Feels like the world upon my shoulder Through the clouds I see love shine It keeps me warm as life grows colder In my life, There's been heartache and pain I don't know If I can face it again Can't stop now I've traveled so far to change this lonely life I wanna know what love is I want you to show me
