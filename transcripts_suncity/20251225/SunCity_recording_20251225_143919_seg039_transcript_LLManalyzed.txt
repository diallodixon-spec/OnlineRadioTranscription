20251225 143919 Rockin' around the Christmas tree at the Christmas party A mistletoe hung where you can see every couple tries to stop. A rocket around the Christmas tree, let the Christmas spirit ring. A lady will have some pumpkin pie and we'll do some caroling. You will get a sentimental feeling when you hear our voices singing Let's be jolly, get the halls with the boughs of holly Rockin' around the Christmas tree, have a happy holiday
