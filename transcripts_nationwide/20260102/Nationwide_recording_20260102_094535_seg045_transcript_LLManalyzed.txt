If you're a wheelchair or a coach, you cannot go to that office without you have to walk in the road unless you have a straight drive to bring you. There's no way you can reach there without having to travel in that road with these vehicles driving like they are mad man, mad people. Right? We did see a person push behind us all the time. No one stand up for us. Sometimes you hear some pretty talk, but nothing behind it. Nothing behind the pretty talk. Alright. We need to get from the minister somebody to find out what about us are the same.
