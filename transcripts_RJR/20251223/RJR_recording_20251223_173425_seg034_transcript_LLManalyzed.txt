20251223 173425 keeping our customers in focus. You're listening to Beyond the Headlines with Dionne Jackson Miller. Thank you so much for staying with us. We continue with you on Beyond the Headlines on Radio Jamaica. I'm Dionne Jackson Miller and it's the eve of Christmas Eve. What better time to be talking about some of the fantastic work that has been done in Jamaica over the past few months. One of the groups, the group we're talking to today is World Central Kitchen. Lots of you have heard the name. We're trying to find out more about them. Still have with us Response Director, Louis Jose Fernandez, Karen Anaya, Community Outreach Manager, and David B Bailo who is Distribution Manager. Ms. Anaya, let me bring you here because one of the features of World Central Kitchen seems to be that you partner with local chefs. Tell us how that works.
