============================================================

It's just a love that just survives on the ends And when you see me rockin' by myself Tellin' me stuff I'll pretend so I tell them And when you see the liquor in the end You'll live me life like it's no problem And then the body will fight with me Tellin' me you need a love for them That's why nuts, never ever change. I'ma stop with nuts, everywhere I go. Come take a lick of shawm on the inside. We got vibes. We got enough energy on girls on the inside. Whoa, yo, come take a lick of sham on the inside, we got vibe. We got love, energy on girls on inside girls are inside it. Oh, yeah. Party night. The old party got fire, guys. When the cooling cup is hot in the oven, oh, yeah. It will move with the vibe.
