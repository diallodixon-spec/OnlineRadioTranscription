from Yalla St. Thomas. Good morning. Maureen Thomas Baker. Good morning to you. Janice Chambers in May Pan. Good morning. JJ from St. Andrew is cruising as well. She was requesting a song, but today is not request day. Olive, Oliver rather. It's Thursday. So check me again on Thursday. Okay. Nicolaan, good morning to you. Nicolaan says she's accepting every gift, big or small as blessings from the father of lights. Amen.
