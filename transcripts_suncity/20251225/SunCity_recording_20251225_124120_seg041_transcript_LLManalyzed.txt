20251225 124120 I will be here, right beside you Every step you take, yeah I will be your strength, your shelter Show you from the rain When you feel your heart's got it And you see the breaks started When the clouds above depart it You'll be right here with me When your tears are dry from crying And the world is turning silent When the clouds above departed, you'll be right with me When you feel your heart's guarded by me
