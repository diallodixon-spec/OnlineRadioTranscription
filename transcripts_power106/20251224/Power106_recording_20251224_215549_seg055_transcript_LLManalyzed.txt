20251224 215549 to. So I'm just here listening to your show and just want to say to you, not the other callers, but to you and your family, a Merry Christmas and a prosperous New Year when it comes. I don't want to jump over the bus, but under the bus. Just say Merry Christmas, and a prosperous new year to heavy tongue. You know, no, tongue. I'm heavy voice. I'm sorry about that. Oh, god have mercy on you. Oh, listen to me.
