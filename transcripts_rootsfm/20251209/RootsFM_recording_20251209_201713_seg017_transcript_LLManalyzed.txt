You love me and you care, but you're never there near You're always on the run, now tell me this Why we can't spend no quality time, kick back and just unwind You always have something for you though, oh That simple me and the love you're not true Cause only when you want to, me hear you shout I love you Tell me where all the passion gone, all of the warmth Tell me where is all of the tenderness And here is something else, that been bugging me for so long tell me this tell me if love's so nice tell me why it hurts so bad badang if love loves so nice tell me tell me why I'm sad me sing again if love's so nice, tell me why it hurts so bad Badang! If love, love's so nice Tell me, tell me why I'm sad Me sing again, well Why if your nails fi do want me Bills fi pay on me Ear fi do want me And you're making fun of me And I'm the one with the J-O-B
