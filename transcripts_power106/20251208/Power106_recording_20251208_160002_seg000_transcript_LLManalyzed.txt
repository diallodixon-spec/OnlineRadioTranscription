Can we just get something done? All the fancy talk and the big words and all of that. Can we just get some thing done? Is it possible? Can we move it forward? Thank you so much to the Honorable Dr. Lloyd Barnett, writing in today's gleaner. On the duties and responsibilities of parliamentarians. One of the main challenges of constitutional change, he says, is the whole issue of the duties and responsibilities of parliamentarians, right? So here we go. That's one aspect of it that I think absolutely needs some probing. Dr. Barnett has been doing this country a tremendous service, especially with these recent articles. Time for a break here on both sides of the story, whitening, and other services for the entire family.
