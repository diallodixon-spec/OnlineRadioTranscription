20251217 161113 We were going to have a wonderful time in supporting a great cause. Mm-hmm It's gonna be hosted by Shabbat Jamaica. Tell me a little bit about Shabbat of Jamaica and exactly what it is that you do So about Jamaica is a one-stop for everything Jewish and a one-stop spreading acts of goodness and kindness to all of humanity On a day-to-day basis, we have an Arc Center. Arc is an acronym for three words, acts of routine kindness. It's on the hip strip of Montego Bay. Anybody could come in, they receive this beautiful yellow box looking like an arc, and they're encouraged to spread acts of goodness and kindness. And when it came Hurricane Barrel, we were one of the first teams on the ground helping people over there with everything we can food water tarps and medical supplies and same thing as right now by Hurricane Melissa and I must say we're still on the ground I know a lot of relief have come and gone
