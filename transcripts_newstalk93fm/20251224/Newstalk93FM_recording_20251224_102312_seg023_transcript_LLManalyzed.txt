20251224 102312 I'm waiting for the right one is the hardest thing I've done. If I knew that you were right there, then I'd never write this song. Joy is yours and mine. Story of our love, so divine. Look you in the eyes, the pleasure is all mine. Sing the chorus one more time. Say, Lord, I'm nice. So nice, so nice, so nice. Never catch a vibe that feels so right. When you're not around, I close my eyes and fantasize. You're sweet. So sweet, so sweet, so sweet. Every time you pass me, skin me teeth. Me and the melody and the beat are so complete. You are the one, the only one, me have to confess. You are the ones, so only one me have to confess. You are the one so me not run, not contest. All I wanna do, give my all to you.
