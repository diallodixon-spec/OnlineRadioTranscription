St. Elizabeth Nationwide 90FM is coming to support you this Friday, December 12. From 9 a.m. to 3 p.m., we continue our Rebuilding Jamaica Post-Melissa Relief Obie Series, live from the La Covea Community Center, bringing real help to families rebuilding after Hurricane Melissa. We'll be distributing care packages and mattresses to those most in need, and our partners will be on site offering birth, death, marriage and adoption registration, TRN replacements, water tank signups, water trucking support to help restore essential access and distribution of 722 land titles for 34 communities across St. Elizabeth. Come out and connect with our hosts, share your stories and let Jamaica know how St. Elizabeth is rising again. is
