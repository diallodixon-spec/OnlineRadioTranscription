12 midday. So once again, once again we bask in the goodness and the glory of Almighty God as we remind you that this is the day that the Lord has made. Let us rejoice and indeed be glad in it. My name is Conrad O'Brien. They call me the fireman. And it's one of those days that we have quite a few things to talk about on the program. However, let me just introduce the program to you officially. Welcome to Straight Up. Of course, we are coming to you live from the studio here at UWI, Mona and the 93 FM.
