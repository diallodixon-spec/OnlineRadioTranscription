The baby of the family in Lennox Her father whored around like all men did Her mother took pills and played tennis So she waited by the stage door, asked the club promoter arrived She said it's on my soul To have a taste of a magnificent life, it's all mine But that's not what showgirls get They leave for dead. Hey, thank you for the lovely bouquet. You're sweeter than a beach, but you don't know the life of a showgirl, babe. And you're never, ever gonna wait. The more you play, the more that you pay.'re softer than a kitten so you don't know the life of a showgirl, babe And you're never gonna wanna I took her pearls of wisdom, hung them from my neck I paid my dues with every bruise I knew what to expect Do you wanna take a skate on the ice inside my veins?
