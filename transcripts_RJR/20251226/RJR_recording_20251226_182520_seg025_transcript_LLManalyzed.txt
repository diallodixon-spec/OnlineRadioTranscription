I want to be encroached out with the clutch. Drinking more liquor, driving a bro bigger. I'm with Moe Sippers, watched by gold diggers. Rocking Bajor Denims with gold zippers. Lost your touch, we kept ours. Popping crystals, freaking the three-quarter reptiles. Enormous cream, forest green, Ben's Jeep for my team. So while you sleep, I scheme you see through So why nobody's never gonna believe you You should do what we do, stack chips like Don't let the melody intrigue you Cause I believe you, I'm only here for that green paper with the easel I'm strictly trying to cop those Colossus sized Picasso
