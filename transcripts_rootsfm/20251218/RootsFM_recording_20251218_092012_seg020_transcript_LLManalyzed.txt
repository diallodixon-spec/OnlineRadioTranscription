20251218 092012 I barely could concentrate I feel a sugar rush in my vein One cup it make my day. I'm missing it when I'm gonna love you. Eat me up. Only you alone can put fire back in the soul. Eat me up, girl. You are the thing that could never leave you alone, no. And no matter what they go say, I'm holding you close. I could never let you go. Miss how she name. Girl,, I'm coming home and I see you rocking. All day, through the night, I'm dreaming. Yeah. Miss Hope, She Named. When you're on the top, make it smooth, my darling. When you're outside, it's perfect.
