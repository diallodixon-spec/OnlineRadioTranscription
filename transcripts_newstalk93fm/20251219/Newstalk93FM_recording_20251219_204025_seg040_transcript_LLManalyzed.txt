20251219 204025 Let you down, my friend. It was a misunderstanding. So we thought you'd get forgotten. Don't I promise from today I'll go drunk like I never drunk. Wave like I never wave. Fine like I never won before. Just to show you I'm sorry. I'm sorry. And I need you back in my life. Look at people by the truck. Emotions running high. We are not in the sky. Taste running down we high. Can. Come to me. This is my apology. Follow me.
