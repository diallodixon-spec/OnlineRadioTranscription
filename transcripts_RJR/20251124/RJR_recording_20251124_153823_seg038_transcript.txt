I use my platform to help people, to see how much we can do, what we can do to help. And I never ended up posting the video because mixed feelings about that. But I kept doing whatever I was doing and working behind the scenes to help as much people as I could. Because my own team members at my company were affected as well. My operations manager, she lives in Catherine Hall. Her entire house was flooded and when she called me during the hurricane, she said, hey, my house is being flooded and I'm upstairs, I'm almost going on the roof. I'm like, what do you mean? And I was like, she said, yeah, man, hold Catherine out for a bit. By the time we got to, you know, the intersection where some of this driving gate is, when we got there, we could not, you could not pass. So if you were on the other side, you were stuck on the other side because the water was so high.
