20251217 113317 Happy, happy birthday to my twin granddaughters. That's Kiari and Kiara. Girls, you are very special. May you both live to see many more birthdays together. Special birthday greetings coming from Grandma Diane. Sister Joyce Miller is cruising along with us. Cruise and family, keep on enjoying the sounds of International Contemporary Wednesday. You need to stop and think. Think about all the many wonders God has performed in your life. And I bet you begin to thank him. From sickness and diseases. Depression.
