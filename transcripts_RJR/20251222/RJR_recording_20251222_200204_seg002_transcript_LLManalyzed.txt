20251222 200204 Christmas 2025 and for those who have made their plans and looking forward to Christmas 25 we do wish you all the very best indeed. The night camp kicks off in just a little bit but first let me head to the break to take care of some bays and come right back to get things all started for yet another Monday. The first day of the work week is going to be a shortened work week this week for those who are nine to five folks. You know how it is? Happy New Year.
