20251231 212424 Tell me, tell me, tell me when When will you give me your loving? Like you've always done before And make me cry out for more And when you did small, no man never want you. But now you get big, all of them rush you. But no matter them, cause all they want do is use you, abuse you, and then they refuse you. But all I wanna do is just take your record, tell me when. I'ma fall in love again. Tell me sweet baby.
