2025-12-12 15:35:50 You can find me out on the road, I'm ready to walk, chest to don't you go such party can find me. I was in love by the melodies. Now the liquor take all of me. And the bass knock my soul out and make sure soca won't let me leave. I don't know if I'll survive. Song after song, wine after wine. I go sing strong and fit for life. Weak like the masses, kryptonite. You won't find me where Bumper's shaking.
