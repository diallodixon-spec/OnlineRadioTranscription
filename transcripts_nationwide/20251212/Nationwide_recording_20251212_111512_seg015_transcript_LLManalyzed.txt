It's been two weeks. I haven't got a car Nothing, so I don't know what's going on, but it's very very upsetting to know that. When the storm was coming, I had to put a sheet apply overhead to save me and the kids from drowning. The amount of rain that was pouring in the house, even the beds, water was flying through like a river. You were just showing me the water running through the house.
