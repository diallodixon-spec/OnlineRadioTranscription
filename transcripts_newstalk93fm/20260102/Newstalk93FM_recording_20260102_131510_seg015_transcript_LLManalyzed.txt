Oh, talking, your body's calling Tell me to show you how I can make you proud I put it down the right way Yet these hips make a boy won't try me Slim waist, pretty face, get behind me, behind me We'll change positions You take a hold on me I'm having visions Of you getting down with me And I know, and I know you've been watching me all night If you're moving right I'ma let you take control
