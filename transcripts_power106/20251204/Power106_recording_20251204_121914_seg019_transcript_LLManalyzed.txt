weather here on Power 106 FM. The Meteorological Service is reporting that a trough is across the island. Now the trough is expected to remain across the island over the next few days. This afternoon should be partly cloudy over central and western parishes. Tonight should be fair. 32 degrees Celsius is the maximum temperature expected today for both Kingsland and Montego Bay and for the next three days look for sunny skies in the mornings and partly cloudy skies in the afternoons. And that's it for your weather report here on Power 106 FM. The information provided for today's weather report was supplied by the National Meteorological Service.
