20251226 135343 I won't ask for much this Christmas I won't even wish for snow I'm just gonna keep on waiting Underneath the mistletoe I won't make a list and send it To the North Pole for singing I won't even stay awake to hear the magic rain display. Cause I just want you here tonight, holding on to me so tight. What more can I do? Oh, baby, all I want for Christmas is you. Ooh, ooh, ooh, baby. Oh, oh, the lights are shining so brightly every night. Yeah, and I saw the children.
