20260101 131008 It never broke my spirit growing up, bro Roll out smelling like carbonic soap Yes, I regularly run boat just to stay afloat And we run joke just to cope Yeah, we're not social mobility, limited scope But mama make me know it's a time longer than rope We don't find nothing in the car car we used to go without Ram food, stamp or no stamp, not with passport Here what you gonna do, put no gun in your transport We collect no bank note, no that at the transport Everybody want a bus like public transport But all the folk, everything we like old This is your home for the hits. Ninety-four. Where it always feels good.
