Yeah man, yeah man, for real. As in me. The vibe bro, the vibe bro. Till a long time bro. Long time. A good six, seven months. I'm telling you, I'm telling you. It's been a minute. In passing, but eyeball and reason. Yeah, true, true, true. So we're looking forward to next year, me again. Big party again. Yeah, we're gonna think about it. Think about it? Can't think about it on the crown, it's so much more shit. And the vibe is nice. Last time we keep partying, AC stopped working, trust me, it's a good vibe to have you back on the show, on the Two Live Crew specifically. And we want to say, Big Up Yourself. Yeah. Christine from March Princess Daily. Big up yourself. Big up Christine. You know the thing already. Rosalie is also saying, happy to hear from you.
