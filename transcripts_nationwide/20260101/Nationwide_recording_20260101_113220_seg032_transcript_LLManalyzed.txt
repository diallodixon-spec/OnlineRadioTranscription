20260101 113220 Forever with you You, you, you say that you really love me I'm always on your mind And you say I should be your lover And we should spend some time But I'm not as sweet as that sweet sweet My heart has been broken before you left So if you want to be my lover You have to prove your love is true to me Cause it's easy to tell me you love me Easy to say you're thinking love me At the beginning of the world
