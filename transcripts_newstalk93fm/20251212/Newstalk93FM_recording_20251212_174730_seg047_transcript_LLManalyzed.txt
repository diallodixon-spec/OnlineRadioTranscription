Everybody's got some things to say, honestly, then just I move them out. The things I say, I'm telling you. Leave me alone. Oh, gosh. Yo, everybody's trying the top to me And I don't know just what to breathe Certain things the mirror and things them see Call me up on the radio and TV. One bag along, talking, talking. No wonder one of those days won't make you ever want to start coming closer. You don't see I'm gonna get paid. Sometimes I don't understand why you can't give me some space.
