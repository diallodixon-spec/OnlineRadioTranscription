20251231 163116 To be honest, but this girl from the planet and I just go on this world. That's my word if you bet on it, no fret panic, I'm gonna make you fly just like bird. I make you wiggle with the ting, I make you jiggle with the ting. Move up your body and swing, I am the king for your world. So the bubble when you bring it to space, my rising, it is tantalizing, come make me seal it, girl. Come give me life and I'll change your heart
