inside my heart baby inside my heart inside my heart there's nothing but love for you Inside my heart Baby my love is true Girl I will give to you Everything I own Always beside you You'll never be alone It's alright, you won't cry We'll always be together My love will shine In any kind of weather Inside my heart There's nothing but love for you
