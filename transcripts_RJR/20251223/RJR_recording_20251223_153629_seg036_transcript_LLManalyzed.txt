And it was just such a heavenly experience hearing all that music, seeing something so different, but also so similar because it brings people together just like here in Jamaica where we have our different events. It's something that we see in the churches, in the schools, so it's for the youth, it's for the communities, the inner-city communities, and for those people from all walks of life, you have elderly that want to finally take on that music dream that they wanted to do from a kid so they can still learn, and it's just something so amazing, and I want to really fashion it here in Jamaica in a way where it's not so much oh it's from Trinidad we don't have to embrace it because it's a Caribbean one Caribbean integrated people so yeah there's so much to come from the movement RSIC we put on it
