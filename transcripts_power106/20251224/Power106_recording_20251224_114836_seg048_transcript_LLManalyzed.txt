20251224 114836 Santa Claus, do you ever come to the gate door? Santa Claus do you ever wonder why we suffer so? When will you come to the ghetto? We would like to see how your reindeer grow. All year long, baby, meet and I'll cry. How we hold on to those hard times. We ain't gonna fight, we ain't gonna cross. We're all the presents that you brought across. Santa Claus, do you ever come to me?
