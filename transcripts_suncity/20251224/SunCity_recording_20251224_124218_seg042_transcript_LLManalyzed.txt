20251224 124218 I've been hoping and praying for this moment for so long For so long, yeah so long Moonlight bright I'm gonna make love to you all night You're only tight Moonlight bright A boy or a girl I'll give to you alright The vibe is right Hold you on my arm Squeeze you on my palm Give you this loving warm and tender Waiting for you so long Got it going on Girl I want this moment forever Loving them I give you till the morning come And when the moon shine till the sun come down girl your energy so right now the fun can't done make the showers of blessing run moonlight bright i'm gonna make love to you all night
