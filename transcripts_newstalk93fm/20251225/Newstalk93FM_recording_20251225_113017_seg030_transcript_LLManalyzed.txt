20251225 113017 You're listening to Sleek Radio, 93 FM. I have a lightning spirit Early in the morning I at it Me cooler ready Me ice done ready Me punching that's automatic I have a lightning jumbie A kind of energy inside me And it ready for the rum, ready ready for the rum Ready ready for the rum ready for the action A spiritual encounter, in me soul taking over Telling me to start up me drinking And do away with good behaviour, so we out on the road now
