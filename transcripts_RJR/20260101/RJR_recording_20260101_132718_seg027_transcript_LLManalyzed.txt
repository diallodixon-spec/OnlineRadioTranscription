20260101 132718 We will be continually blessed and entertained in your glory and honor. We thank you for the listenership of this program. We pray that the listenership will grow from strength to strength. We know there's a competition out there with these broadcasts and networks, but we want to tell you thank you, Lord God, for Radio Jamaica 9410. Thank you for this true life. We are not taking anything for granted because many persons didn't wake up to see this. Amen. So we pray God that this new year 2026 will be a happy one, a beautiful one, a prosperous, a bright, a productive and a hopeful year. We know we're going to have challenges and we know the storms are going to come and the difficult times
