20251230 130503 Are you lucky? Are you a 50,000 dollar lucky ring? Yes. So to me, I think whether you're going to give the church or whoever you want to fund, I think the real issue is about the accountability and the transparency. Which of course we are not going to have because we don't have a society that demands these things. That is it. We have a society that, the present administration just do as them like. Any president, anyone, anyone, whether they want to be Labour right comrade or Labour come. It don't really matter what government come in Jamaica. If the people in Jamaica remain focused on bread and butter, well, no pun intended.
