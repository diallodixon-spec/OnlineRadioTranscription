============================================================

I woulda loved it if you keep me fun I wish you woulda treat me like a yacht Keep me wild while the waves in my rocks Why you can't stay for me like Nikana And keep your lips for me like your marijuana I woulda loved if you treat me like a bluff Stay with me the whole night just to go for nars and raw You don't understand What your woman needs from her man While you live on the streets all the time Your spirit is in my heart These streets don't love you like I do You need to know that you wanna keep your woman loving you When you're talking about a realestation, a good realestation, you're talking bout Rooster from 96.1. I wish you woulda treat me like a house.
