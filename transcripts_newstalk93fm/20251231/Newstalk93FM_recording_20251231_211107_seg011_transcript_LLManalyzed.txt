20251231 211107 Deep as the blue sea, deep as the blue sea. Love me really and truly. And even though the storms will come, no, we won't run. Just love me. Deep as the blue see. Nice and easy, so deeply we submerge under this emotion. Like an anchor, you keep me safe. I'm not afraid of the ocean. I keep you warm and cozy. You'll be coming on me arms When the storms approach, it's a wipe on me When all of us think like the tides on me The lighthouse, we are where I fall in Deep as the blue sea Your love's flowing into me And even though the waves are rough This love is tough, just love me All in all, it's a wrap Deep as blue sea, deep as the blue sea Love me really and truly truly. And even though the storms will come, no, we won't run. Just love me. Deep as the blue see. Wherever the wind may carry us, I will never let go.
