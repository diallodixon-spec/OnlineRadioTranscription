20251217 132621 We have been facing this climate crisis that we have. And so we felt that we would roll out a program, and we did last year, a kind of three-phased interventions, immediate relief, but to provide assistance to restore, rebuild, and provide more sustainable livelihoods for people going forward. So having laid that out and having prepared for this intervention, we were ready. And so very, very early, we were able to roll out these packages. Within the first week, we had nearly 6,000 packages on the road. And after a month, we did about 16,000 packages that were either delivered already or in the process of being delivered. So we were ready and we did this with our partners. We didn't do it alone. We've had a number of foundations that have collaborated with us, the JNN Foundation, Sandals Foundation, the M Foundation.
