It says, Chef Chris says, there's a saying that's so true, hard times make strong men, strong men make good times, good times make weak men. Thank you very much. Can you read it again for me please?

And we're not saying that you're supposed to create a life for your child where it is not as difficult as yours, but they must also understand the reality of life. That's what we're saying. They must be able to maneuver and function when hard times come. And that is one of the things I've recognized working and dealing with young people that when that time that switch. Their problem solving skill is poor. Exactly. They drop arms quickly. Poor.
