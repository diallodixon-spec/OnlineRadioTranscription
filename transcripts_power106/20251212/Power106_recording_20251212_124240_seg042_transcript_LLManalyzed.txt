2025-12-12 13:06:16 of a lost cause. Simon, every time you take Jamaica Critics' call, I have to calm myself down. I don't know whether to be mad at you or him. That's from Beresford. Beresford, we have to take all calls. And you have to listen to everybody's opinion to know what is sensible and what is not. For instance one Simon hate is a toxic word to use to your caller don't encourage the corrosive emotion in your listeners keep up the engaging debate without toxicity have a good day I use the word hate to say that a lot of my callers hate Jamaica Critic now I'm not using the word to say that people mostly I'm describing what is the reality as you would have seen from a couple of the messages so I love you nice
