I don't know who she want to dance. Do you want to dance? Do you want a dance with somebody? Do you? I remember a few years ago when I'm going to a club uptown, when Malika was still. You understand what I'm saying? And a girl from my school, she gave me a piece of dance there. And I tell you something, I couldn't stand it. Yeah, I started to feel pain. And I'm not going to tell you where exactly I was feeling the pain. But she gave me a proper dance. Until this day, I remember. I was in a jeans pants. May I tell you?
