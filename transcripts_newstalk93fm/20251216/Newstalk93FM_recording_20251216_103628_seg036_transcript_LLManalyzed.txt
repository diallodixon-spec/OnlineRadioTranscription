20251216 103628 to everyone to hope and bless them with a peaceful Christmas. And we will have a very progressive New Year as long, you know, they said together we can, all right? And I believe in no uncertain way, we are going to come back stronger than before with the kind of unity that I personally will be leading to making sure that all hands are on deck and our development of our different eras is essential in every single man need. You know, I want to just remind the listeners that remember, we in the Papua Indivision host the university township where we host a lot of students off campus and we continue to look forward to having them going forward. All the best for the Christmas season and a prosperous new year. Thank you very much Councillor Darrington Ferguson, Councillor for the puppy division. God bless you sir, all the best for the season and all the best for 2026.
