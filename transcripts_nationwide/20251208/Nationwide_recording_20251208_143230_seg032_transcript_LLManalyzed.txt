Idiots alone! Choke, choke, choke! To be somebody was my heart's desire Something never stops and no prior I, no pain Probably was the youth with the worst attire Back in the school I sing panquire No pain From the day my life begun Another little bit of tears run Everybody have their own story This one is for all who have give up and done I've been there before What if I fight to fight Would I need a thousand books to write I've been there
