20251222 201223 So once again, kickin' it loud Doin' everything, your dust is a vibe Above the wall, I think I stand Here on stage with a mic in my hand Bustin' it loud, to the crowd The age is twenty, I'm from the south Be apart, break my heart Get ready for this, mind your own business People in the front, show me what you want And I will give it in, get ready for this Do all you can, so people don't just sit Movin' up and down, dancin' on the ground Feelin' kinda free, security How's this sound that moves you from the ground? If it was the animal that kept me in cages
