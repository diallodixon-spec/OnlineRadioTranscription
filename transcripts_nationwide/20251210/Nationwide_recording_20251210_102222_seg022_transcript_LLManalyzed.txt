While we're not talking about a missing girl this morning. And I don't know how you who are in a position where because of work commitments or otherwise, you can't physically go and pick up a child. From school. And you have nobody to send. So you're a mother who, you're often on the job, you're a father who has to be on the job, your parents who have to be at the job, both of you together, different spaces, and you're just depending on, boy, he's not so far, you know, so, you know, little, you know, just walk this way and come home. How do you process now, when you know school over, and you're waiting for the child to call you as programmed, to say that mum and me reach home, daddy and me reach home.
