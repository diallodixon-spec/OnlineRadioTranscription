I wear this cat costume with the word sin printed across it, and I say, God hates sin. That's right, Alan. Uh, is this safe? Is what safe? Well, the part where I crawl into this cage of large Alaskan wolfhounds and meow like a cat. I think you're missing the point, Alan. Oh, yeah, right. God hates sinners. No, God hates the sin in our lives. It's the sin or rebellion against him that separates us from God. God loves the sinner, Alan. He does? Yes, that's why he sent Jesus to die on the cross, to pay the price for our sin. Oh, yeah. OK, take one and action god hates sin nice doggie god really hates sin back back back okay guys i'm done get me out of here alan you're not meowing another message from lifeline productions the comic strip of radio at lifeline pro
