2025-12-12 12:03:21 All our major corridors are now cleared and so there's access right across the parish. In some of the rural areas, access is there, albeit it might be single lane, but we now have access across the parish. We now still have some 23 shelters open with approximately 120 persons still in our shelters. All our high schools are open. We still have some primary schools that are closed since the passage of Melissa. But the parish we are rebuilding, we're cleaning up, and we're ensuring that we remain a very resilient people. In terms of crime, we are still seeing a downward trend in crime. In terms of shootings, shootings are down 29%, robberies are down 57% and murders are down 47%. We have 16 murders when compared to 30.
