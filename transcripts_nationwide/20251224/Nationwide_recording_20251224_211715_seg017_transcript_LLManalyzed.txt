20251224 211715 I don't think there should be a choice. I don't think your relationship with your mom should be as such that you would even have to choose. To me, a mom should raise a man to want to treat the girlfriend or wife with the same love and respect. And she should encourage her son to treat this woman the way that she is treated by her son. So if there's a conflict to begin with, there's a conflict with that. In my opinion a there's something clearly off balance because to me as a woman I don't have any kids but you know like my nephews have enough but like the one that's a kind of helping with right now I feel like if he was to not treat a woman with the same level of honor and respect as me I would have a problem with that yes I would have I would have draped him up and said little boy come now you know so I am I don't think this should be a question I'll be honest I don't think that should be a question because then I really shouldn't be it really shouldn't be but um okay it's a sensible sensible one all right Naomi I can you tell them
