20251219 171009 Minister Vaz, why is the JUTC abandoning the failed express service to Ocho Rios and poaching on short of the daily requirement of 25,000. Minister Vaz, make public the performance reports of the JUTC service on these rural express routes. The OTRS route is poorly supported and a financial drain to the JUTC. Reports show passenger loads as low as 10 persons on a 53-seater unit. Minister Vaz, you're failing in your duty to hold JUTC management accountable. Stop the experiments at taxpayers' expense.
