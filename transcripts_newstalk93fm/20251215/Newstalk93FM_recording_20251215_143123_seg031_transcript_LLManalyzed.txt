20251215 143123 To go and take back what you say. Burn all the bridges. Don't ask forgiveness. Walk away like I'm someone you hate. Don't let me down easy. secrets to hug you Guess you're right, it's too good to be true Was the point, all I needed was you But time after time, I just fussing and fighting It's time that you do what you do And it's cool, mama said it was fishing to see I got lost in the pool Knew it was coming, I watched how you moved How you turned back on me and laid me to lose Remember the text, how you said that you'd do Said that you'd never leave, we would fight till it's due But as it went on, I was fighting for you Said the text had turned green, why the fuck it ain't blue? Guess you done and I get it Said you stand, you wanted my name and you left So I'm guessin' that you never meant it Said you tryin' hard on cause the love was so strong Now I'm standin' alone in this kitchen Singin' sad songs, but I'm knowin' that this don't last long If you leavin' then leave cause your bag's gone But just know you can never come back home Don't let me down
