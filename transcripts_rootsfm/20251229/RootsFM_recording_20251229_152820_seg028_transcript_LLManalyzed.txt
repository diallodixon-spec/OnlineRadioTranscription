Now if I'm talking to my mom, or with a long lost friend, the minute I hear your voice on the line, conversation ends. You don't have to spend a whole night. Wondering what to do. Remember, dear, there's someone here. Love to talk to you. Down my number. Any old time. You don't need a reason, any old season will be fine. I'm the user for software show. Because I can see something's changed, and I know you're laughing.
