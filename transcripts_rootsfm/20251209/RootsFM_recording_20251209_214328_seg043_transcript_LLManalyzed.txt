I knew just what to say Now I've found out today That all the words had slipped away But I know there's always a chance A tiny spark will remain, yeah And sparks turn into flames And love can burn once again But I know you know Whenever you call me, I'll be there Whenever you want me I'll be there whenever you need me I'll be here, I'll be there whenever you need me. I'll be there. I'll be around. Yeah.
