20251224 162112 Rockin' around the Christmas tree at the Christmas party. Misses all hung where you can see every couple tries to stop. Rocking around the Christmas tree, let the Christmas spirit ring. Later we'll have some pumpkin pie and we'll do some caroling. You will get a sentimental feeling when you hear our voices ringing. Let's be jolly. Take the homes with brown hearts. We're walking around Christmas tree, have a happy holiday. Everyone dancing merrily in a new old fashioned way.
