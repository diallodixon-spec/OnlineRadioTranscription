20251216 202411 We're not giving up, we stand tall. Those who struggle will rise from the fall. Jamaica people, one and all. Hear the call, hear the call. Build Back Jamaica, a sweet, sweet Jamaica. We only see you like our Build Back Sweet Jamaica. From the hills to the sea, let love be the key. Together we're strong, one family. built by Jamaica. Sweet, sweet Jamaica. We only think of that one build by sweet Jamaica. The sun will shine. The pain will fade. We'll rise again unafraid. We see the youth and maybe elders. Neighbors come together. Love gets stronger. No light, but still we see. There's no food or water. We have plenty of food. We throw down the island fights. Spirit of the people, still alive. We rebuild with heart and pride. One love, one step, side by side. We not evil, we stand tall. Through the struggle, we rise from the fall. To make our people proud.
