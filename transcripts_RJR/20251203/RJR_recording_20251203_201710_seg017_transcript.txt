============================================================

I don't know What happened to the love we shared Don't go Sometimes I think it's just not fair I know The pain I feel inside my heart I wish I'd known it from the start That you would come and bring my heart I can't hold back these tears in my eyes Feeling the pain inside because I'm Dreaming of love Thinking of you Remembering times that we once shared Dreaming of love, thinking of you Knowing someday you'll come back to my life
