============================================================

I'm from Gemini and all the great volcano Kings of it, kings of it And each wave them, the sound they come out as dance and hero make hell When I scream and I boogie down from the dance floor I have to select a few more Come, Poultry, when you hear a shot, buzz for sure Because the place will open a door Well, man, a woman, a fool, a lowly poor N Because it sound like sound just string up in the dance and warm the party. The school of Richard, man, the sound name Sun City, ready with a difference. From Portmore. What do you mean? Mama be big sound. Yeah, man.
