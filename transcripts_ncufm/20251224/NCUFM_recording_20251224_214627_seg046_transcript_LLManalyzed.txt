20251224 214627 I ain't good enough, but he still loves me. I ain't no superstar. The spotlight ain't shining on me. No, no, no, no. Cause I aint good enough. But he still loves me, not me. I used to wake up some days and wish I stayed asleep. Why can't you get up? Cause I went to bed on top of the world Today the world's on top of me Everybody's got opinions They've been in my position Better break my heart when I hear what they have to say about me What they say about you I might not always fall short of being worthy But But I ain't worthy. Cause I ain't good enough. But you still love me. I ain't no superstar. Spotlight ain't shining on me. Cause I want to be for you. Cause I aint good enough.
