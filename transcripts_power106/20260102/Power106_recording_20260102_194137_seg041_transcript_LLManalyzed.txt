20260102 194137 Mrs. Cherry, his recent best performance, will be coming at them on this trip of seven furlongs and could arrive in time. I wouldn't rule out that possibility. But for me, it's my true self of a battle agent. I suppose as a general, the threat to both. Race seven is a restricted allowance for a five-way road and a field of seven things. But seven furlongs is the journey. Chief dissident, I like the name, Patrick Lynch trains, of course, believe me, Milwaukee. Former jockey, do you know that Patrick Lynch was a former jockey? Patrick Tyrone Lynch, oh yes, he was. Demar Williams will ride chief dissident, finished just under four days behind Blood Moon in what I thought was a pretty competitive race that happened last week, Saturday. So seven days later, Chief Dissident is expected to run well. Now there is a successful man, won easily, didn't beat much because Rockola is what he did, comes up in class here to contest this.
