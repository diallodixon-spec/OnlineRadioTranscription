You gave me love that changed the sweet. Keep it coming, baby. Keep it coming. Ooh, and what I feel is ecstasy. Every time you're next to me, keep it coming, yeah. Baby, keep it coming. All my daydreams and dreams. And now I know just what it means to be in love And every night I thank my lucky star If I'm lost in paradise
