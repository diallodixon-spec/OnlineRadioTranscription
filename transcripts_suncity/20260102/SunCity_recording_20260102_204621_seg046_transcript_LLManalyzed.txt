20260102 204621 I get what I'm asking for. No matter what you say about life, I learn every time I bleed. The truth is stranger, so is the danger. I gotta let my spirit be free to admit that I'm wrong and then change my mind. Sorry, but I have to move on and leave you behind. I can't waste time, so give it a moment. moment I realize nothing's broken No need to worry about everything I've done Live every second like it was my last one Don't look back at a new direction I loved you once, needed protection You're still a part of everything I do You're on my heart just like a tattoo Just like a tattoo I'll always have you I'll always love you I'm sick of playing all of these games It's not about taking sides
