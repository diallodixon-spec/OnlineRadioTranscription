2025-12-11 17:20:03 I'll tell you 156 right here on Roots FM 96.1 on the FM band. This has been Rootsology, your first edutainment classroom on air anywhere in the hemisphere. It's been with your C.G. Yerker giver, Denise Isis Isis Isis Miller, some say empress, some say princess, some say queen, giving up on my lions and my lionesses in the concrete jungle. Only the fittest the fittest will survive in this time. Mentally, physically, spiritually, emotionally, musically, magically, and of course financially, alio. On this here, thankful Thursday, Rootsy Retro Stylish. Hey, choose self-purses where the king and the queen reside. Hug up yourself, love up yourself, bless up yourself, love your country, love your man, bless your country, and start badmouthing your country. Tcha, mecha, resilient. Hey mama, Africa's in bad way.
