20251218 194437 startup masters there now. The opportunities are endless. We have coaches from various universities reaching out to us, asking us to identify talents for them because they've seen the potential and the athleticism of the Jamaicans coming out of our program. So pathways to higher tertiary education overseas is through the roof. But we don't only want to focus on tertiary education outside of Jamaica. And this is why the partnership on the MOU, the Micro-University College, is important. When you have five of our players going overseas to study, we have about 50 remaining in Jamaica. And we want them to be able to take up these opportunities at the Micro-Universal College and we're with them to go there and create a class to learn about it and continue to give back. A minute to go here, sir. Talk for that minute.
