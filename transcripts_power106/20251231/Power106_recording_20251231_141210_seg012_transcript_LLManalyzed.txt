Of course, we have told you throughout the year that feast days are held on every day in the year. And essentially, a feast day is a term used to refer to celebrating a particular figure in the Christian faith throughout the different days of the year. And today, it's Pope Sylvester's Feast Day. Pope Sylvester, the Bishop of Rome from January 31 in the year 314 until his death on December 335. Yes, that's right. Now, he's an important figure in the Catholic Church. Of course, I mean, there's no bigger than the Pope, is it?
