============================================================

long, they have the filters and the pumps running when the pool not in use. Absolutely, I mean, they've been on point. I'm not aware of any other pools going off. In King's Center, when I say going off, I mean, whether going green or going cloudy, which would indicate the fluctuations in the chlorine, which is the number one agent used in pools to keep it, you know, sanitized and ready for people to swim in. So I think in terms of testing, recording, you know, putting in what is necessary, you know, the supplies were on point. I can speak for Campion 2 where we had done orders of chlorine and tablets before the hurricane was coming because we saw the increase in the rain and how that can throw off the chemical balance. So again, hats off to everybody at all the pools that are major or just in schools because you know the school pool is not open to the general public.
