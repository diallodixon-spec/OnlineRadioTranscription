20260102 192922 Yeah, still a loser. That's something that should be considered. Nearly out of time. Let me just get on the final comment. Yeah, I think one, overcoming that kind of deficit from 2020 is always going to be very, very difficult. And in particular, a government that had some, a fair amount of positives, you know, the crime reduction, the economic numbers and so on, were very, very, and some major projects that they'd been doing and executing. So that was always very difficult. The other question is, if not Mark, who and is there anybody who could do a better job? That's also something I think PMP delegates might be looking at as well. Alright, and that's going to have to be the cliffhanger. We end out because I'm out of time. Girl, I hope that when you come on radio tomorrow you talk about the carnage on the roads. You know sir, tomorrow is Saturday. Tomorrow is Saturday, Monday. Alright, there you go. Thank you all so much. Wonderful talking to all of you. George Davis, Janet Silvera, Milton
