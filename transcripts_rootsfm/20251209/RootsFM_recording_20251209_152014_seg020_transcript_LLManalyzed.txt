You're listening to Roots 96.1 FM. See, I've been loving you from a distance. Ooh, ain't love wonderful? Only a fool in love would understand that the greatest joy in life is for me to get next to you. And I know one day you'll think that I've let you have. But to see, those mixed up moves and attitudes, I don't need them. Now, I don't mean them, and I won't be on the side. Those mixed up rules and attitudes, I can't use them.
