20251229 212011 I'm gonna tell on you one day, I swear Can't you see I'm scared you're supposed to be my father? Ooh, daddy don't touch me, girl I'm gonna tell you one day I swear, can't you see, I'm scared, you're supposed To be my father Every day I wonder why my daddy had to be the one to take away my innocence Oh, sometimes I wanna die, it feels like no one cares for me and it's evident That something must be wrong with me I'm not as happy as I seem to be The long showers I take don't wash away the memories Why do I have to face these tragedies? We go through struggles in life I'm aware but to have my daddy touching me that's just not fair He's stopping from destroying my future Believe me he's behaving like a creature Daddy don't touch me now I'm gonna tell on you one day
