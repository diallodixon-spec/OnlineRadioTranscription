20251218 091412 Welcome, welcome, welcome, welcome to your program straight up right here in the 93. And indeed, we're coming to you live from the studio here at Broadcast House right here at UWI Mona. It's indeed a pleasure being with you this morning and of course we bask in the goodness and the glory of Almighty God. Stick and stay with us now for the next three hours or so as we bring you your program, your mid-morning number one fix straight up right here and the big 93. I'm Conor O'Brien.
