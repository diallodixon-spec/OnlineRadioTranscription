2025-12-11 18:22:05 And I'm trying to get to you To you, to you To break the walls away Is as obvious as the colors of your hair And would you believe that I really can? And I'm tryin' to get to you Oh, I tried writing letters But they all came back unopened Yes, you thought you'd read the same old thing again Oh, I tried teleporting Every time it ringed, was open. But you thought you'd hear the same old thing again. But you believed over and over. You said that I liked your love, who I met from a star. And I gave her a place in my heart. Never knew she would talk about me.
