20251226 123627 There's nothing that we need You call it a holiday But when it's done I'll need a break From all the smiles I know I'll fake I can't wait for Boxing Day I don't need silent nights Or Jesus Christ to break bread with my neighbor. I don't need a Christmas list because what I wish for can't be wrapped in paper. There's more than just one week a year that everyone's still here. Forgive me if I'm not the guy You call for Christmas cheer There's no magic in the lights and snow No love under the mistletoe No joy for me in going broke There's nothing that we need
