It's like I love you, it's out of style It trend in film and I kill woman and child When the dual get so unkind So we did stay from the beginning of time Man get sacrifice for them family move up in a life When they talk you to me get crucified you a fied Bitch a perfect living a lie I know it's so sad Nobody no believe in a love again, because they've loved and lost Nobody no believe, in a friend again I'll be here, stopping now, I can't let you wrong Nobody no liar, and it hurts my heart, still a heart for one another
