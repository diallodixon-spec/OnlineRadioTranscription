============================================================

And I'll keep on fighting for the things I want Though I know that when you're dead you can't But I'd rather be a free man in my grave Than living as a puppet or a slave So as sure as the sun will shine I'm gonna get my share now what's mine And then the harder they come, the harder they'll fall, one and all. Ooh, the harder they come. The harder they'll fall. One and all.
