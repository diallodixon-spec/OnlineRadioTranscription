Me and you going there so tell that piece of **** of an excuse to call the boyfriend that he ain't got to worry about you coming back home Cause you done found what you been looking for all along Just a little bit of vibe and stick Now you on Florida time Now you so round and thick Slim waist, pretty face, you Florida fine So you ain't got to pay for drinks no more Cause I done found what I've been looking for all along. I'm talking about where they rang everything. Oh niggas where they been hesitating. Ain't no my love language. Let them say what they say. They're bout to be like out of the day. They can map it in a club. I'm talking bout swimming in vitamins. You can get a damn fitting in the back of my truck for me. Don't take it low.
