20251212 210602 I'm free from all bars and all borders and dope I'm free to price the love because I'm not priced above Some I know you wash your face with Babylon soap Me have a leap of faith that means me have a leap of hope Life's rough and hard but with it me a free cope Some take it on the level and some slide down the slope Silent river run deep but Gangali have to float I was born to be free. And who have me, go you off the hook, so pick y'all. Could have hit me little more, me get down instead of soft. Iniquity walk all the work witchcraft. Them inject me body with coal, but me knock off. Serious like all 50 judge when all laugh. I was born to be free. And me all ganga league, ganga league.
