One time. That's what I love. That's why I tell them if you're hot, not wrong. And I think that's what people don't understand. When I'm on social media and Twitter, I realized that there are some people who, when they want to get followers and likes and they want to bring up them thing, they attack Jamaica. So I saw somebody the other day and she put something up to say, Jamaicans don't know how to dress. And then somebody said, okay, I've used Sherlock right now because she know what's going to happen. And I said, it know. When they're done. I said, why should I do that? Why should I do that. But I realize it's a thing now. We can't help ourselves. Yes. We're going to respond. Yes. All when people are saying, why not responding and say, should this one?
