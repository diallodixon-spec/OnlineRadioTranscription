We find that the parking might be limited in some of the areas because it's a fact that there are townships that might be overpopulated with vehicles during the times. And we want for persons to understand that being alert too is not just to take your vehicle keys and pass it to somebody. I was downtown some time ago and somebody said you're going into the store and I said yes. He said okay give me the key so that if the record, then I can move your vehicle. And if we're not paying attention, somebody might just out of wanting to run inside Sir Bedward and to pick something up and to get back up, then you come outside, your vehicle is gone. So you were talking about people have to be alert.
