Time now for Money Talk with BPM Financial. I'm joining Managing Director of BPM, Peter Rose Hall. Hi, Peter Rose. Hi, Emily. How are you doing? I'm not too bad. And you? I'm well, thank you. Good. All right. Tell me what we're talking about today. Well, today I want to talk a little bit about, came across this really interesting video by Charlie Mungo. I don't know if you remember him. He died, I think it was in, not last year, year before. He is the ex-partner of Warren Buffett and he was talking about some of the notions we have when we invest. People always say saving is safe and investing is risky.
