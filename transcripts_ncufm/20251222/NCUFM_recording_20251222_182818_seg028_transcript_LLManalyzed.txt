20251222 182818 this evening tonight. Wanna thank you for tuning in on the 91 with me. Thank you to my producer Abigail Williams. Wonderful show done, wonderful show. Now if you made it home, I hope that you've been able to have a nice dinner already or you're about to. If you're on your way, I am praying that you make it there safely. So you can have a nice dinner. That's on my agenda this evening right about now. Get me some din din. And giving God all the thanks and praise for all he's done.
