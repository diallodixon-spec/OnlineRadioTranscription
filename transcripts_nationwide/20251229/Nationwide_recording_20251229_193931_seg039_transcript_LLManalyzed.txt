20251229 193931 Sorry, repeat that one more time, Father. Mrs. Baston, you're retired, yes? You've been an educator for years. Why did you decide that this was so important? That you had to leave retirement to take on what is, by any measure, an incredible task. We're not going to get out of our troubles, our economic troubles unless we have more productivity. We can't have more productivity because our workforce is illiterate. It's fundamental. It's not just the literacy that kept me awake at night. I'm wondering about the quality of person we are creating. What does our citizenry look like?
