So that's not, no, let me finish. Let me finish. That is not the norm. So that's why I said this has to be investigated as to why this happened here. And the Ministry of Education has to get involved, the police, et cetera, to find out why there was a breach in what is the norm in terms of protocol. Yeah, but something like that happened before already too, Simon, where that lady had picked up the little girl and murdered the child, yes. Yes, and we have not heard any investigation on that one either. What happened from there, I don't know. Well, the woman was prosecuted, I'm not sure where the case is at the moment, but that led to an increase in the vigilance that schools are supposed to have before allowing the child to go away. So again, this is a breach of that protocol and it must be investigated.
