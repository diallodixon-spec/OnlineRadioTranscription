Tonight I gave in to believing I'll hear you say You'll always stay Somebody turned my life around And I'm not the same Suddenly I don't hear a sound Only your name And I really need you Tonight I give in to the feeling Yes, tonight I give in To the brave of loving you Tonight I give in to the thrill of loving you. Tonight I give into believing we'll always stay in love this way. Oh, tonight.
