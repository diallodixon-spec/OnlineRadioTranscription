I know somebody's sweating right now. Brettula hula. hula hula. Hula hoop, girl. You a one and the one and them a two, gal. Hula, hula, hoola, hula hoola hoola hoop, gal. Bust a dance and a one and brand new, gal. Hoola, hoola. hoola. Hoola. hula. hoola, yo. When you are fine, nub on a whine and stop. If you whine and stop, you make the hula hoop juggle. Before the hula whoop, chop your dozen whine and clap. Catch it back on dozen whine and drop. This a no fad, man. Forward with no one drop. Before the summer, you know what I think, that earn blame my sister.
