2025-12-12 14:04:22 Baby, I've traveled through the stars and many moons to find you. Baby, the sugar on your skin, the sweetest melanin, yeah. See, when you step up into the light and your body looking right, no consternation in this light. Ever take a shine shine I'll travel a million miles Just look up on your smile Baby, look up to the clouds right now Say it to me, I will be around for the entire night Lady, while I'm close, I'll be here by your side You're doing things to me that I cannot deny The way you're looking, girl, you are so certified. Put me back on time when you give me that fast, fast, fine, fast, fine. Fast, fast, fast, line, fast, line. Take my boat to the dark side and anchor down by the bay side. I know you're watching now. I'm walking like a wazer.
