20251230 195135 test between Australia and England. The assessment comes after a dramatic two-day match in which 36 wickets fell, with England securing a four-win victory. Inconsistent bounce and excessive sea movement dominated proceedings, raising concerns over the quality of the surface. The MCG head curator, Matthew Page, admitted he was surprised by how the pitch behaved and acknowledged that it did not meet the expected standard. As a result of the NCC's ruling, the venue has been handed one demerit point. And under the NCC regulations, a ground that accumulates six demerit points within a five-year period faces a one-year ban from hosting international matches. I assure you that the MCG will suffer no such fate. There will not be a repeat of this.
