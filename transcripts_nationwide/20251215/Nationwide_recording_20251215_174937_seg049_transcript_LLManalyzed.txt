20251215 174937 there was a fatal confrontation. You hear this person was on bail for this particular murder. They were person of interest in this particular one. They were wanted in this particular one, these are persons who contribute multiple murders. Now the question is, and I've asked this question before, if you're looking at it from a highly scientific perspective and every murderer has a multiplier effect, would you prefer for us to target a person with a low multiplier effect who does not contribute significantly to the major violence and have persons out there saying the police know who the criminals are. The police know where the criminals are. They're not going for them. Why are they not going for them? Because if we go for them, there's a higher probability that they are going to engage us with lethal force and that we will have to engage them with lethal force, and that we will win.
