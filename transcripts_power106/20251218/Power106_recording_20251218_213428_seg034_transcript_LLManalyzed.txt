Remember things you used to do, and you don't have to do them anymore because you have passed the test, you have improved, you have moved on. Because life, Pastor, nothing beats satisfaction, you know, and improvement. You see, when you move ahead and improve, it makes you say, yes, life was worthwhile living. You don't have to be rich, because money is not the do-it-all. But then when you're comfortable and can eat a good food, you can go where you want to go, you can do what you want to do, you don't have to sleep on a fret. Because I remember those days, you know, pastor, I rented a house at Richmond Park, you know, and I remember there was one time I have us to wait until the landlord gone to bed and come in because I couldn't pay him.
