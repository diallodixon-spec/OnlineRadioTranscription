20251231 150505 I don't care if we share Only moments a day I just don't want to be lonely I'd rather be loved and needed Depended on to give a love I can't give more When you're gone, when you're gone I just don't want to be lonely I'd rather be lost I'd rather have a sweet love story I don't mind the tide sets the sun to the moon I just don't wanna be lonely Let me stand right there
