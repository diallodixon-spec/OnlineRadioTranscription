20251224 123524 have to do in the future. So it's Christmas Eve I don't know how many people are cooking or what you're cooking but gifts are being wrapped I'm sure about that and the spending pressure is very very real trying to count the pennies while we are but of course you know it holding on to our pockets because our wallets are failing it too. So we're not just here to judge and to lecture. We're talking about budgeting for Christmas. So even if you feel like it's already gone too far and how the choices you make or have made can now affect you in January. So let us have a conversation about how we can move forward for the new year. So we have our resident financial specialist Diane Campbell. She's the manager, sales and services at the VMBS branch. Welcome.
