20251216 134128 I was the queen that I'm meant to be. I lived two lives, tried to play both sides, but I couldn't find my own place. Caught a phallic chow, cause I got too wild, but now that's how I'm getting paid. Cause I'm shining like I wanna be We dreamin' hard, we came so far, now I believe We're going up, up, up, it's our moment You know together we're glowing Gonna be, gonna be golden Up, up, up with our voices Going to get you so wanted Gonna be gonna be golden
