============================================================

I go take the blade I just want you to come and bite it up Just a little winding up Come and meet me behind the truck and we rev it up Whole day Keep throwing it back, I know why you stop Baby, no way We could post up all the pictures you want When you're ready I go over here, darling, you go over there But we could meet in the middle and start a makana, stay in the middle, hey But we don't do no jam to a rhythm in the heat, I can radar. Whoa, on my radar, you stay on you stay on on my radar.
