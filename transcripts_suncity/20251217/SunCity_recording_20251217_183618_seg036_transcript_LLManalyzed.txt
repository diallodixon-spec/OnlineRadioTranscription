20251217 183618 Got to be a better way. Got to find a better way. My pocket is empty. No money to buy. And God knows I'm hungry. Don't ask me why. This is the 60. Only working on me. I'm just a victim of poverty. Where there is life, then there's hope, they say. So I know that there'll be a better day All I've got to do is open chest and pray And I know that my God will lead the way
