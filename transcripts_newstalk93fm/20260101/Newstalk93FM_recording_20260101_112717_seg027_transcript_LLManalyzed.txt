20260101 112717 We had the melody, and it might defeat us, so we wait. Waiting for the right one is the hardest thing I've done. If I knew that you were right there, then I'd never write this song. Joy is yours and mine, story of our love, so divine. Look you in the eyes, the pleasure is all mine. Sing the chorus one more time, say, Lord nice, so nice. Never catch a vibe that feels so right. When you're not around, I close my eyes and fantasize. Lord, he's sweet. So sweet, so sweet, so sweet. Every time he pass, me skin me teeth teeth Me and the melody and him and the beat are so sweet, sweet You are the one, the only one me have to confess You are the one so me not run not contest All I wanna do, give my all to you
