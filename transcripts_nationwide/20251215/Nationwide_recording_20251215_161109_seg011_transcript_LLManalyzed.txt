Now let's start guys. Now what sparked your passion for music? You Kerry, specifically. And how did your family support your dreams? What sparked my interest in music was church. Yeah. Because most of my family can't really sing. That's crazy. I know. That's not the same for me. But my grandmother could sing. Yeah. Cuz we were from, we were, I was born and raised in Arnett Gardens and we spent a lot of time in Maxville. Yeah. Sunlight Street and you know, going up, I could hear my grandmother sing but most of my enthusiasm for singing basically came from church yeah that was my kind of experience uh and um as a Seventh-day Adventist I just want to ask a critical question um is it something that um at the Seventh-day Church that it is in a rule book somewhere
