20260101 184925 I know somebody's gotta have a system living Waking every morning saying I gotta get it Focus on the paper, can be a time of adventure Drugs been stuck and flippin', just trying to make a living Baby, shakin' on a pole, just to you wish it Singin' my lips, facin' drama so they can feel the chill Niggas turn around and look just cause they had a taste And niggas droppin' out of school with a paper case Who am I to hate? I ain't just a jokin' suckin' wave Let's get this girl off, get me high Just tryin' to motivate Just tryin' to make it till I make it till I'm pearly Lost so many hopes, can't face another way Another loss, another cause, another mistake Now you're standing in my way I've been through a hurricane, a pain and I'm saving the day And if you watch it and you cry, fuck whoever has it
