In this corner of the good and the right, stands a champion robed in white. His height exceeds the heavens. His weight outweighs the world. His reach everywhere His age is ever more He is higher than the highest Greater than the greats No one could ever take his crown away He's more mighty than the mightiest. He reigns time above. He's the all-time undisputed king.
