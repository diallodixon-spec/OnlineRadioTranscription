20251223 123125 Movement is good but balance with spiritual training makes it complete. It's kinda like faith without works is dead. You have to put them both together. And then we have the healthy lifestyle. Someone with a healthy lifestyle focuses on balanced meals, rest and self-care. And this verse coming to us from 1 Corinthians 10 verse 31 says, so whether you eat or drink or whatever you do, do it all for the glory of God. This is saying to us that every choice we make, everything we choose to put into our bodies, the food we eat, the beverages we drink, the amount of rest we give ourselves, can be worshiped when done with gratitude. Remember our body is a temple.
