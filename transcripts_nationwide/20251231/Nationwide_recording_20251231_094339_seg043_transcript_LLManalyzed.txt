If they call and get through, and based on JPS's assessment, they can say, yes, there is no downed pole. However, there is a line rubbing on this road down there, and we have to turn to turn off the system because if we turn it on it might gash and cause a fire you understand so news commentator Jay's brother can't sit at home and say the line down there saw a rub and JPS say them can't turn it on right now they are trying to come on this day to fix it other than no communication you don't know what's happening
