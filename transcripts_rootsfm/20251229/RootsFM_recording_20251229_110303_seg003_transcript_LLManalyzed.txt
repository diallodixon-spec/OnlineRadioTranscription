Please take a moment, call your family, call your friends, call your neighbor if needs be, as we have an intriguing discussion today that you don't want to miss. It's Beyond the Prescription, and we're live listening on Zeno.fm. I'm your host, Dr. Stephanie Mullings, pharmacist, educator, and entrepreneur. As we would have gone through a rest period, I may say, there are many things that would have happened and could have happened, but we're grateful that we have life and that we are able. And many of us can say, yes, we have health and good health. Also, we're thankful that we are really blessed as a people.
