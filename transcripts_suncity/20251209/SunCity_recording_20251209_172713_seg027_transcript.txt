Christmas all around And I'm trying to play it cool But it's hard to focus When I see him walking across the room Let us know it's plastic now But I won't be here next year Santa tell me if he really cares Cause I can give it all away If he won't be next year I've been down this road before Falling in love on Christmas night But I knew you'd say I woke up that night
