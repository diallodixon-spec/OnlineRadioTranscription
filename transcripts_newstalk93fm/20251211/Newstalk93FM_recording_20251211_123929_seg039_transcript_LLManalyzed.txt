============================================================

You're the smoke, I'm the clay. Oh, my, my, you're taking me out of the ordinary. I want you laying me down so we can bury. On the edge of your night, staying drunk on your vibe. The angels up in the clouds are jealous now that we've found Something so heavenly, higher than ecstasy Whenever you're next to me, oh mama Always in black and white Until I saw your light I thought you had to die to avoid Something so out of the ordinary
