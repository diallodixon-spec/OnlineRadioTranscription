20251218 160305 with me, healing me day by day and teaching me that even painful seasons can be used for growth. Through it all I can say with confidence that God has never left me, He ways I didn't always recognize. There were seasons where things didn't go according to plan and I felt disappointed, I felt confused. But God never stopped working behind the scenes. He opened doors I didn't even know to pray for. And He closed others that would have harmed me in the long run. Through it all, He remained faithful, proving strength after strength when I felt tired and my clarity felt unsure.
