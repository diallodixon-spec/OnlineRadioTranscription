And even though the storms will come, no, we won't run. Just love me. Deep at the blue sea. Nice and easy, so deeply we submerge under this emotion. Like an anchor, you keep me safe. I'm not afraid of the ocean the ocean keep you warm and cozy you'll be coming on my arms when the storms approaches so I fall in whenever things like the tides and the lighthouse we are where I fall in deep as the blue sea your love's flowing into me and even though the waves are rough, this love is tough. Just love me. Falling out the rough. Deep as the blue sea, deep as the blue sea. Love me really and truly. Just love me now. And even though storms will come, no, we won't run. Just love me, deep at the blue sea.
