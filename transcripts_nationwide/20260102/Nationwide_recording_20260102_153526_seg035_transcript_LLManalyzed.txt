20260102 153526 claimed sophomore album Generation of Kings has slipped two places to number 16. And his debut project, 438, remains in steady rotation at number 36. Rounding out the charts, top five are Olivia Deen's The Art of Loving. And number two, we've got Armani's The Impact, which I listened to as well, very good. And number three, we've got Squash's Fame, I haven't listened yet, Faith, Always, Move Everything. And number four, and of popcorns, Nothing Without God at number five. Now beyond Jamaican shorts, the momentum continues. On the US iTunes reggae albums chart, Her Name Is Love is currently positioned at number 31, signaling growing overseas traction. Released via Def Jam Recordings in December, the EP marked a creative pivot for Massica, leaning into themes of love, desire and relationships. With global charts responding and awards recognition piling up, Massica appears poised to turn early 2026 momentum into yet another landmark year. While driving through Jamaica, there's only one artist I listen to. Massica.
