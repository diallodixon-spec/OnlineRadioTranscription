20260101 170506 Means you ain't gonna show If you look out your window tonight Pulling the string with the note that's attached to my heart Read how many times I saw you How in my silence I adored you And only in my dreams did that wall between us come apart Oh, my darling, not three times on the ceiling if you want me Twice on the pipe if the answer is no. Whoa, my sweetness, means you'll meet me in the hallway. Whoa, twice on the pipe, means you ain't gonna show.
