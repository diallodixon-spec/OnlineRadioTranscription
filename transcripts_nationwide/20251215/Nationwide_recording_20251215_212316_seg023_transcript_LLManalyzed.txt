20251215 212316 Tell me what you really like Baby I can take my time We don't ever have to fight Just take it step by step I can see it in your eyes Cause they never tell me lies I can feel that body shake In the heat between your legs You've been scared of love and what it did to you You don't have to run, I know what you've been through Just a simple touch and it gets set you free We don't have to rush when you're alone with me
