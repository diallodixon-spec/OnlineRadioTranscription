20251222 180607 I still want to But I still want to Now let me get to the truth, truth, truth I just wanna live good Look, the sun could shine the same time with the moon Why, I could only drive one car at a time But I still don't want to, but I still want to I don't know about you, but I come here to fight Come to play a match I'm not leaving until I'm wet Come to play a mass I don't live my life with regrets, no I come to jam on a bumper Come to drink out a liquor Until my head's gone And I'm miserable All down on the ground And I'm causing trouble
