20251224 140907 You come back home, baby, and the games we are playin'. I and I woulda never ever strayed. Girl, me say you lock me, now you come back soon. Get me solid as a rock, you know me tough like stone. I believe that love is a powerful thing, feelin' deep within. And if you believe in love, free up your mind, let this go within. As early as the morning start, I'm girl, you shine so bright. Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh. Any time, any time.
