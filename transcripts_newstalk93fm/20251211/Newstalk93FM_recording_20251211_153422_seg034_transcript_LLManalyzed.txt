Don't ask for all your things back cussing out my name, yeah Just to go and take back what you say Burn all the bridges, don't ask forgiveness Walk away't the one you was holding that night Telling all of your secrets and hugging Guess you're right, it's too good to be true What's important, all I needed was you But time after time, I just fuss and then fight And it's time that you do what you do And it's cool, mama said it was fish in the sea I got lost in the pool Knew it was coming, I watched how you move How you turn your back on me and leave me to lose
