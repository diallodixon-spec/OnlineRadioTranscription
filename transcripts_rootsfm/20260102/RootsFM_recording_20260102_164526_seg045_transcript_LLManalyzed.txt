20260102 164526 We dance all night to the songs they play We can't come again Do we just the same? Now I feel it in my heart We in such a golden time at the parties Now there's hardly any safe place left to go Someone's bound to come and try to spoil the show Remember the songs used to make you rock away Those were the days when love used to reign we danced all night till the songs they played we can come again we do it just the same
