============================================================

Survive my darkest hour My faith kept me alive I picked myself back up Hold my head up high I was not built to break I didn't know my own strength There were so many times I Wondered how I'd get through the nightline So I took all that I could take I didn't my own strength And I crashed down. I was not built to break. I didn't my own strength.
