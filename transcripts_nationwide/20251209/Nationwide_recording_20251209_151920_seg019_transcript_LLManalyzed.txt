I won't hear you laugh anymore Every night, I won't see you walk through that door The time wasn't on your side, it isn't right I said I love you, it's too late to tell you But I really need you to know, oh baby No, I'll never forget you I'll never let you out of my heart You will always be here with me I'll hold on to the memories, baby, baby
