20251217 214539 I hate Gungo! The round red is the best peas. Gungo rice and peas nice with fresh grated coconut, milk and gungo soup nice to...oh my god, no. Struggle. I just said, Gabby, if you said gungo peas is it, Kari, what are you talking about? Okay. Then she says, my ideal Christmas plate is this, okay? So gungo rice and peas with curry goat gravy, eskavish fish and some steamed veggies and some curry goat. That's it. And some cornbread to sop up all of that gravy. Cornbread. Oh wow. Actually I want to put cornbread on the table this year. Yeah, with a lot of honey. Cornbread is underrated. Cornbread with honey? We're not talking about like the cornbread that we pick up in the store. It's kind of like a cake.
