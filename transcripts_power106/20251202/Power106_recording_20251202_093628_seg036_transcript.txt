So Richard, just to remind our listeners about the Incorporated Master Builders Association. What is it that your organization does? Right, so we're an association that represents local building stakeholders, contractors, merchants, associated firms that form the private backbone of the Jamaican construction industry. Okay, so tell our people in very simple terms, we understand what you're saying. Why is it that Jamaican contractors must be integrated in the process of rebuilding the houses that were damaged? 156,000 it is said, 24,000 completely destroyed and the rest died. For Ralston, firstly, the association is deeply, deeply sympathetic. I think there's no Jamaican who isn't hurt by what's happened.
