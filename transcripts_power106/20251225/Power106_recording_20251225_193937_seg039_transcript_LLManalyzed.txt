20251225 193937 Fill a glass and maybe come and sing with me So kiss me under the mistletoe Pour out the wine, let's toast and pray for December snow I know there's been pain this year, but it's time to let it go Next year you never know, but for now Merry Christmas we'll dance in the kitchen while embers glow We've both known love, but this love we got is the best of all I wish you could see it through my eyes, then you would know My God, you look beautiful Right now, Merry Christmas The sun is raging on
