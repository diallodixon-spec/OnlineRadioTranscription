Old Bay Seasoning, of course, to the Lee Correctional Institution in Bishopville over the weekend. It was packed in a piggly wiggly supermarket bag. It was intercepted before the prisoners got it. Prisoner officials say smugglers sent drones to the prison every night trying to drop drugs into the prison yard. But they say this one with the meal fixings, that's a first.
