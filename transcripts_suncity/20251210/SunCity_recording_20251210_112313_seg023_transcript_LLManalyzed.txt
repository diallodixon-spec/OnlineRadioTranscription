============================================================

When you hold me, I forget every word that I wanted to say. I am freely lost in your love. There's no one else for me. I surrender completely. Oh, my heart is racing. I'm shaking in colors in the love we're making., I could never breathe, never survive. Baby, you're my reason why I believe there's meaning in my life. I have faith in love, faith in ourselves, faith that this is right. I will surrender forever.
