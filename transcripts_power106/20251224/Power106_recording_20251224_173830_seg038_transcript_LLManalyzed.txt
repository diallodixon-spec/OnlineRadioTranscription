20251224 173830 grateful for the beautiful rings, your affectionate friend, Gobnett. Day six. Nuala, what are you trying to do to us? It isn't that we don't appreciate your generosity, but the six geese have not alone nearly muddled the callin' birds, but they laid their eggs on top of the vet's head from the pear tree, and his bill was sixty-eight pound in cash. My mother is munching sixty grains of valium a day and talking to herself in a most alarming way. You must keep your feelings for not fair, Gov'net. Day 8. Nula, who the hell do you think gave you the right to send eight hefty maids and milking here to eat us out of house and home?
