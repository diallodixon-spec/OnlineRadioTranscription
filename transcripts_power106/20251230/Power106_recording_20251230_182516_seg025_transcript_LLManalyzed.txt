So we were very pleased with that, and I can tell you that Jamaica made a very delicate, incisive presentation, which I believe, you know, woke up the rest of the group to where we are, who we are. The bobsled thing, of course, was very current, where they just won some big trophies, and they were amazed at what Jamaica could do, and it opened their eyes to what Jamaica, the possibilities of Jamaica, were able to be competing at an international level. So it was a very good Congress, I thought. I had been to one earlier three years ago, didn't go back because I didn't think I'd gotten enough out of it, But I think by virtue of the fact that the International Federation is now thinking wider, thinking more development, thinking more associate members, we were able to make that important contribution and I think we came out of that Congress, Jamaica that is, looking pretty good.
