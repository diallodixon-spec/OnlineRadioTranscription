I love you always Oh, I miss those days Now I feel so all alone Baby, where did we go wrong? Tell me that love is here No, it hasn't disappeared Are you still in love with me? Like the way you used to be? Or did it all fade away? In the hurt I feel? Is it here this day? Are you still in lo- me? Like the you used to be Or did it all turn out? Like even the pain I feel Is still the same You're listening to Roots 96.1 FM.
