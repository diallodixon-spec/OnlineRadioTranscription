**Interview with Dennis Chung, Chief Technical Director of the Financial Investigations Division**

In a recent interview on Nationwide 90 FM's "The Point Is" program, Dennis Chung, Chief Technical Director of the Financial Investigations Division (FID), sat down with host George to discuss his role and the controversy surrounding his appointment. Chung, a public accountant with extensive experience in the public and private sectors, has been at the center of a heated debate over his ability to remain impartial in his position.

When asked about his day-to-day responsibilities, Chung explained that as Chief Technical Director, he oversees the operations of the FID, which includes four front-facing divisions and three supporting divisions. He emphasized that the FID has a structured approach to investigations, with a committee-based decision-making process that ensures no one individual has undue influence over the outcome of a case.

Chung also addressed concerns about his potential bias in investigating high-profile cases, including those involving the Prime Minister. He stated that the FID Act requires the division to respect the rights of citizens and to bring awareness to financial crimes. He assured that the FID's decision-making process is designed to prevent any one person from having too much power, and that cases are assigned to a committee or subcommittee for review.

The interview also touched on the controversy surrounding Chung's appointment, with the opposition PNP criticizing his perceived bias in favor of the Prime Minister. Chung acknowledged that he had made comments in the past that may have been perceived as favorable to the Prime Minister, but emphasized that his role as Chief Technical Director is to ensure that the FID operates in a fair and impartial manner.

In a surprising moment, Chung's host, George, revealed that he had known Chung for many years and considered him a "good guy." However, George also stated that Chung had found himself on the "wrong side of history" in this situation, and that Jamaica was at a crossroads in terms of corruption.

The interview provided a unique insight into the inner workings of the FID and the challenges faced by Chung in his role. Despite the controversy surrounding his appointment, Chung remained confident in his ability to lead the division and ensure that it operates in a fair and impartial manner.

As Chung noted, "The idea that the head of the financial investigations division, the chief technical director, which is me, must be a superior investigator to everybody else in the FID staff, is rubbish. It's a rubbish idea." He emphasized that the FID's decision-making process is designed to prevent any one person from having too much power, and that cases are assigned to a committee or subcommittee for review.

The interview concluded with Chung reiterating his commitment to ensuring that the FID operates in a fair and impartial manner, and that he would continue to work to prevent financial crimes and protect the rights of citizens.
