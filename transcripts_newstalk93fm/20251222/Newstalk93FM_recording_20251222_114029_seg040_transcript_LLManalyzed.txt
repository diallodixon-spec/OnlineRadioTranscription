20251222 114029 I'm droning alone and I'm lost in my feelings Somebody send me a sign cause you you that we all need love. Jump up and show me love. Wait up, and show me love, together. Say we all need love, jump up and show love, wait up, and show love. Sucker makes we shun not together, no place that I'd rather be Show not together, right now is our energy Show not together, soccer is our partner We show not together, I tell you so much of my mind that I can't sleep I'm stressing all the time
