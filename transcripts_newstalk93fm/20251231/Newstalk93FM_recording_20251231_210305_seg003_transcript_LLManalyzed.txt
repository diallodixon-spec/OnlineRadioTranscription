20251231 210305 Is this a dream? Am I awake? Moon on your skin Hands round your waist Music is love And I heard you not play The way how you move It got me feeling away, away, away. Baby, tell me can you feel it, feel it, feel, it, feel it? Baby, tell me, can you feel, feel it? Make me know when you are feeling, feel, feel, feel it. Let me know when you're feeling. Is this a dream? Am I awake? Moon on your skin? Hands round your waist?
