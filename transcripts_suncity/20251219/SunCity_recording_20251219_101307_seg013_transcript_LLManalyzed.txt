20251219 101307 I don't need the Christmas tree. I don't need to end my stocking. There's a bonfire place. Santa Claus will make me happy. It's a good toy on Christmas day. I just want to put my own more than you could ever know. Make my wish come true. All I want for Christmas is you. Oh I'm gonna make a list and send it to the North Pole for Saint Nick. I won't even stay a way too far.
