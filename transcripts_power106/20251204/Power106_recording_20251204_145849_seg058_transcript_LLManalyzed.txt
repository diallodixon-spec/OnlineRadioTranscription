And apparently all of the calls that Davin has been receiving so far have been from people on the digital network. So it has been very difficult for them to connect. He's answering, but you're not hearing him or the other way around. So that's the challenge that we're having. We're simply not able to make those connections, but we continue the program because the show must go on no matter what is happening. Even if I have to sit here and talk to myself for the next few hours, we certainly have information to share. There's always information to share. So the phone lines, the numbers are 8 7 6 9 2 2 4 1 1 2, 8 7 6, 9 2 2, 2 4 1 1 3, 8 7 6 9, 2 2, 4 1 1, 4, 8 7, 6, 9, 2, 2, 4, 1, 1, 5. Those are the numbers to call and you can send us a WhatsApp or text message. You can follow us on messages on our social media platforms. We are on Facebook at power106fm, Instagram at
