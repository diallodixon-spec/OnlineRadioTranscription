20251225 103623 You're a season of tears Your heart has been broken And so filled with pain I know you are hurting I know how you feel Your nights seem more darker Without sunshine ahead It will get better it will get better won't last forever won't last forever and if you trust in the Lord your nights will turn to day Just remember, it will get better
