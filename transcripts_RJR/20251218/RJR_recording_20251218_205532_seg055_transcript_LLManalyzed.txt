20251218 205532 Thank you. Good night. Mr. Darling, this is yours. Just a question here on upgrades. When we are seeking to do an upgrade, we have to pay for a new application. Yet, say we have to also do our annual renewal fee. Can't there be some compromise where that is concerned because you would agree that the outlay is going to be a bit on the heavy side. Can't there be some compromise because I am due to renew in January and I need to also apply for an upgrade. So can you just give me a response when that is concerned, please, sir? Thank you. Thank you, caller. No problem. Good. What I'd like to say to the caller is that what you could do is apply for the upgrade at the time that your license is ready to be to be renewed or registration is to be done done and therefore you pay one fee there rather than doing it before and then having to come in later to register again so you could do the upgrade at the same time. Very direct and and here's the last question
