============================================================

still being housed. All people are going through some of the most difficult times they have ever experienced. I tell you, this is not an easy thing for us to be navigating at this time of year when you're supposed to be happy. You have to be so concerned about where it is that you're going to rest your head. It really is painful. And you do what you can, or you're doing what you can for now. And here I'm talking about we the people, right? We pool our resources. You're trying to help people who are on the ground in these communities who are suffering. And you realize that you can go in and you do as much as you can and it doesn't even feel as if you're doing enough. And that is so sad.
