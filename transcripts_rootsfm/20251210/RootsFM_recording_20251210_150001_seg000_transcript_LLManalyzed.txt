Thank you for making us your number one choice. And as you all know, couldn't have done it without you. Keep a smile on your face and while traveling through this journey, remember to love somebody today. Take some time out to love. It's not gonna cost you a dime to love your brothers and sisters. L-O-V-E each and every day. Yeah, it is free. And feel free to call me up also. So are you ready for the big one? Courtesy of the Mr. Song competition. And of course I'm going overseas for this particular Mr. Song of the afternoon. Keep it locked to the 9 to 6. It is now a minute after three o'clock. For those who are familiar with this particular one, this one is easier as ABC. Eight, seven, six, seven, nine, one, seven, two, eight, three. Back in the H's we're talking about. Good vibes it was. You know what I'm talking about?
