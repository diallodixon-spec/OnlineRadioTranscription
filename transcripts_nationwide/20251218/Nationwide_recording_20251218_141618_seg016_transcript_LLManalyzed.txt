20251218 141618 I was so exhausted from all the nights and days I caught your smile and you blew me some heat Well, I like your style, it was strong but sweet I fell for you right then and there I didn't care who knew I'd follow you anywhere Give me, give me, give me all night long Give me give me give me keep playing that love song
