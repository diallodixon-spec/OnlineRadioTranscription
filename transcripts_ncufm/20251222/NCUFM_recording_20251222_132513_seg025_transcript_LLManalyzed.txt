20251222 132513 I'll bring you more than a song For a song in itself Is not what you have required You search much deeper within Through the way things appear You're looking into my heart I'm coming back to the heart of worship And it's all about You, all about You, Jesus I'm sorry Lord for the thing that made it. It's all about you, all about you, Jesus. I'm coming back to the heart of Jesus.
