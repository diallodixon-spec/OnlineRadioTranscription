20260102 112614 I'm all good already, it's almost done, It's scary. I'm not where you left me at all. So if you don't want to see me dancing with somebody. So we are the sunset in the tunnel. If you don't believe it, anything can stop me. Don't show up. Don't come out Don't stop caring about me now Walk away, you know how Don't start caring about me now
