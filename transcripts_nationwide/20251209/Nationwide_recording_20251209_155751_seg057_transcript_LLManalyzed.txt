If you want me, if you need me If you love me, if you trust me You want me if you need me I don't know what he does to make you cry But I'll be there to make you smile I don't have a fancy car to get to you I walk a thousand miles And I don't care if he buys you new sleeves Does his gifts come from the heart? I don't know But if you were my girl I'd make it so we'd never be apart
