20251223 163218 it's such a blessing to be alive even though times may be ups and down you know mm-hmm I'm thankful for life I'm also thankful that I have good friends yeah I have friends that can lean on I hope everyone has at least one friend they can lean on when times are rough yes those are my two things that I'm thankful for yes man I can work with that I can work with it thank you so much bro you know while you're sharing what I'm thankful for. Yes, man, I can work with that. I can work with it. Thank you so much, bro. You know, while you're sharing what you're thankful for today in the WhatsApp line, I want to say that gratitude is important. It's the act of recognizing the good things in life and giving thanks, especially to God, who's the source of all our blessings. And when we're grateful we choose to see the good and say thank you because it's not just about saying thanks with our mouths but also showing it through our actions. So the question is why should we be grateful?
