It just comes and makes you weak. And girl, we must believe it. In our hearts we'll feel it. Love is where you find it. What's this mystery I've been capturing I can feel the glow of love touching on my skin When I'm close to you there's a feeling from deep within Only happens when I'm close to you, there's a feeling from deep within. Only happens when I'm lying here with you. Oh, we're just strangers, but we know each other. And I'm so glad you look what we discovered.
