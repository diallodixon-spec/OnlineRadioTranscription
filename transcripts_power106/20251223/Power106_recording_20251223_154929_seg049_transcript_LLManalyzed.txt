20251223 154929 Yes, the reason why I bring up all of this is because we're talking about America. I don't want to be ungrateful, because I tell you the truth. I have three children. I remember the other day my son, he went on the travel program, and Ms. Mackenzie had to tell God the truth. I think it was about three months. And what I would save in, I would say then, 10 years. At three months he'd work it. And if you beg him to come back, because he had a friend run off and go get married, and he said, no, don't do it. He said, boy, it's a country, I work hard, and they have lots of people, but they're people were lazy. He said the people that were born there, they were lazy. So he said when he went there, they loved him because he was a manager. The first time we gave him a big brother's hand.
