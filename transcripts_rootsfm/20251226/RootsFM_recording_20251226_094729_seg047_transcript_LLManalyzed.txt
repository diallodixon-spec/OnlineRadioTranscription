20251226 094729 Driving through Kingston, who do you listen to? Rules affirm, nine to six point one. How can I be so damn demanding I know you said that it's over now, but I can't let go Every day I wanna pick up the phone And tell you that you're everything I need no more. If only I could find you. Like a cold summer afternoon. Yeah. Like the snow coming down the chimney. Like a wedding without a queen. I'm missing you. Yeah. I'm living better as you're without the sun.
