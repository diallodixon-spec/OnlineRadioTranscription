20251229 214126 Walking, standing tall, but still fall for me You come in with baggage, it's costing me Still don't have it all, but give it all to me Come and turn me on, we'll go all for me Please say you love me, you ain't upgrade me Face like crazy, man, don't chase me Say you wanna see me, well, you're gonna take me Put it in for me
