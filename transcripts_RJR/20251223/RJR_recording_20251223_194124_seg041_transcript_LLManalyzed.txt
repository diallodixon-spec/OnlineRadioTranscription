20251223 194124 Hey, none else can bless you with enough ambition and enough imagination, you know? And it's a good thing because the only place you ever see me here, Clark, this Christmas is right inside of your mind. So what do you imagine? Look, I didn't have your gift put down already. I'm not having a gift, no. Oh, you really have a gift for me? Ezwa, tell me. Yes, I do have a gift for you, you know? Yeah, it is my present at your Christmas dinner on Thursday. And I come nice up to the place and tell you say your food tastes good. I'm gonna lie, you know what I mean? So, everybody needs a friend like me. Okay, first of all, my cooking is immaculate, okay? And second of all, you are not allowed within one mile of my yard on Christmas. And why are you not having your own Christmas dinner at your own house? You must have someone who's here now with your third eye. I mean, it's all part of my every-mickle-make-a-muckle strategy. See, the more houses I go, the more food I get. Plus, please, I don't want to depress them for certain food items I move. Them definitely are going in a short supply. So the more house ma go, the more of them ma get. Every-mickle make a house.
