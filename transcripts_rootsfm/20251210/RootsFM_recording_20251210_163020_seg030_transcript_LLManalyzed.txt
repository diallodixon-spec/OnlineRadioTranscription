============================================================

I only think of you on two occasions. That's day and night. I could walk away if I could be with you. Only you can make it right. I only think of you on two occasions. That's day and night. I'd go for broke if I could be with you. Only you can make it right. Cause every time I close my eyes, I think of you. It don't matter what the season is, I still love you with all my heart.
