20251225 093819 I'm just torn in between the two Cause I really wanna be with you Cause I've been telling me I should leave you alone Leave you alone Now you can wait a whole life wondering when it's gonna come or where we stand. You may have got your heart broken. Never last as strong as you used to. And don't feel as good as you used to before And all the things you say, things you used to do Will run out the door Ooh, no more will you be the one That's what you tell everyone around you But you know they've heard it all before
