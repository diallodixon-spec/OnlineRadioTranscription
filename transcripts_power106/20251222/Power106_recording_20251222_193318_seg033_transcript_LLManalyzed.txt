20251222 193318 really introduced me to the sport of surfing because as you know surfing in Jamaica is not a nationally recognized sport so yes I was very fortunate to live in close proximity to them and be able to to go there every day as a kid and learn to surf you know Ike Wilmot used to take me out because it's very dangerous as you know the ocean the sea is very dangerous used to take me out as a young kid and, you know, as the years passed on and you learn more, you kind of start to take on a more independent role in your career development. But definitely, the Wilmot family has done so much for the sport of surfing in Jamaica and continue to do so. And, yeah, I'm just a byproduct of all the work that has been put in before me. It's just my time to take the baton and bring the sport of surfing in Jamaica to the level that it needs to be. Yes, congratulations on that.
