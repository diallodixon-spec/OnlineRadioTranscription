20251226 214622 Yo, the party's shot! Good luck, Frye Eye. Change your eye and forward. Quick, quick, quick, quick. Yo, drop it now, man. You know Friar in response to the girl, you know. Globally hard and abroad, you know. Quick how you feel today. Your soul set free when you reach the edge. And turn back now to feel yourself. Everybody's so green. We lay our heaven on a green bed. We be people, say. Dance all through the season.
