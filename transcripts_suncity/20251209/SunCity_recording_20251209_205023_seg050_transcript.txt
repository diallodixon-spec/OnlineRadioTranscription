Just like a skyjack, girl. You know you're looking fine, and you have a little time, then you go, go, go. When I'm on your neck, you know you looking fine. And you have a little wine, then go, go. Mind you not just your eyes, your thighs, your hip and your waist. This girl, that dress, I'ma show the place. Sing some like amazing grace. You're like your girl to roll out cups cups up, X-Y. We gonna bring the vibes. And if the girls getting high, we bringing the vibes. X-Y on the radio!
