But funds should not be going to, taxpayers' funds should not going to religious institution or organization in this fashion. Should not. There are many persons in this country who are atheists and what have you, who are not a part of the church, some are atheists, some don't believe in church, some don't go to church, some are not part of the church. And they are part of the tax base in this country. So when those in the church might not have any objection against the church receiving this, what about those persons who are not members of the churches, who are part of the taxes, and you take their money, and you take places in the church? So that was MP.
