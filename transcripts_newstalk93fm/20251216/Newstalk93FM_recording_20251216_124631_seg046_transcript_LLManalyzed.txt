20251216 124631 You got me kissing the ground, the sanctuary. Share with me what you've done. Oh Lord, return me to dust. The angels up in the clouds are jealous, know what we've found. Something so heavenly, higher than ecstasy. Whenever you're next to me, oh mama. Always in black and buried on the edge of your night staying drunk on your vibe The angels up in the clouds Are jealous no one we found Something so out of the ordinary You got me kissing the girl, girl Saintuary, try to meet what you're taught
