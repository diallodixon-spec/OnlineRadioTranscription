20251212 183017 you shall overcome. Thank you so much, Pastor Liking. And you know, I don't know if you feel a little anxious like myself facing a new year. Here comes 2026. How will we cope in the new year? As the Bible says, the Lord has brought us the same God who brought us through 2025 who gave us overcoming power. He will do it again. We shall overcome in his strength. Praise the Lord. And with this promise, we say happy Sabbath and happy holidays. God willing, Sunset Serenade will be back with you in January 2026 after a short season break. Happy Sabbath and happy holidays.
