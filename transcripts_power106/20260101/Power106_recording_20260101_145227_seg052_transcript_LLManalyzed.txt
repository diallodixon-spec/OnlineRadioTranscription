20260101 145227 And I need you here beside me Can't be without you anymore Let's make reservations with you This is just between me and you There will be no standing in line Cause baby, tonight you're mine We'll unplug the phones Turn the lights down low Hold each other tight And take it reason I want you to myself to share with no one else Make each moment last forever and ever and ever
