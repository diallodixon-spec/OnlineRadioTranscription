20260102 094828 Amen. Amen. And so we don't know what 2026 holds us. Lord God Almighty. I went to our Reverend Glenn Graham funeral. Hallelujah. Down in Round Hill, St. Elizabeth. And he was 70 years old. And he passed. But when he started January 2025, he didn't know that November the 28th, he was going to pass in the hospital. Hallelujah. Glory to God Almighty. But he did a work for the lord Jesus Christ. I said he did a work with all those songs that he sing to bless so many Christians over the years. Hallelujah. And to be a blessing to all of us. Oh we thank god for him. And so we put him away in peace in the name of the lord god almighty. Amen. I'm saying that we don't know the unknown right now it's January we don't know what the rest of the year the year holds for us but one thing is for sure glory to God Almighty we have hope in the Almighty God that he knows the future and he knows where I will be
