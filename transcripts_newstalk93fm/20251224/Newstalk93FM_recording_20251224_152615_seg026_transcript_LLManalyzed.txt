20251224 152615 I swear when it be much, I'm gonna make my dog bleed it out. He got money with us, yeah. He did us, he did us well when it be much. No be hype, everybody be close. There's no darling with us. You never thought you'd come back Which kind of money we never see before I never take my cake away. Ajay, you can count my grace. I just say my lane, my lane.
