20251219 141514 It's funny that I haven't thought to call you before. And why is it I haven't seen you around anymore? Another year has passed and I can't erase the memory of your smiling face. So I had to call you up and say Gee, we hit prison So don't forget the party that we're throwing The warm fire from the fireplace will be glowing It's been a long, long time I still can't figure out why you crossed my mind I guess it's just Tuesday
