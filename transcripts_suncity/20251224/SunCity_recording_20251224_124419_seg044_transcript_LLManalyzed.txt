20251224 124419 this moment for so long, for so long, so long. I don't want you badly. I need you madly. I'm gonna train for this moment, for so long. For so long, moonlight ride. I'm gonna make love to you all night So hold me tight Moonlight bright I call you a girl I'm into you alright The vibe is right I'm in love with you And I know you love me too It's more than words can say True love will never decay, oh yeah You fill my world with joy and splendor It's a place to see Full moon so the light shines brighter So the world is empty
