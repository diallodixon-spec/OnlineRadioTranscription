20251217 120806 Take away yourself from trouble, take away yourself from trouble. You know nothing, you're sweet like the gift of life. Walk away from trouble, stay away from strife. Life is to live through the best in life. You only live once, you're not twice, you. Follow the road on the righteous path. Stay focused and conscious. Put your in your tartar, say. Don't make the wicked, mind is sinking, son. Take away yourself, from trouble. Take away, you say, from trouble. Cause it come, in a double, take away, yourself from trouble. Until I see how you done certain things.
