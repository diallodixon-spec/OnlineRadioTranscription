20251215 193024 I'm glad you called back. Yes, by Copacabana. I'm wondering what happened to her if she could get one of those houses. So my recollection was the CPFSA had removed the children. Oh my God. Yes. Yes. I called about that to find out if that really happened. It did. I remember they went to the shelter at St. Benedict. I think it was our Harborview primary, one of the primary schools. And when I did check with the CPFSA, they did tell me that they had taken the children into state care. Oh my God. Yes. That's what I recall. You're breaking up Carlene. Really? Forgive me if I'm up to date.
