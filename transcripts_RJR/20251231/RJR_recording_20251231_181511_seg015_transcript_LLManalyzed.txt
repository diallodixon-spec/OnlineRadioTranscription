20251231 181511 first black vice mayor, first Caribbean American, youngest person to be in that position as well. So what led to that? So I ran for office in 2016, became the first black commissioner in the city of Tamarack. Never in the history of our 62 years had a black person a win or ascended to the role of commissioner. And so I was proud. You know, I walked into City Hall and everybody was looking at me like an anomaly. And you know, I made history again when I became the first black vice mayor. I flexed my political power and helped other people to win office. So we helped Mike Gellin. He became the first Haitian-American to win there. And then a couple of years later, we flexed our muscles again and had more Jamaicans coming. So now it's three Jamaicans on the committee.
