20251223 121912 We need a little bit of company, you met me at the perfect time. You want me, I want you, baby. My sugar boo, I'm levitating. The Milky Way, we're renegading. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I got you, moonlight. You're my starlight. I need you all night. Come on, dance with me. I'll meditate on you. Moonlight, you're my starlight. I need you all night. Come on dance with me, I'll meditate. I believe the truth in me. I feel it in our energy. I see it's written in the stars. We can go wherever, so let's do it now or never, baby. Nothing's ever, ever too far. Glitter in the sky, glitter in our eyes, shining just the way we are. I feel like we're forever every time we get together, but whatever, let's get lost for more. You want me, I want you, baby, my sugar boo. I'm meditating, the Milky Way.
