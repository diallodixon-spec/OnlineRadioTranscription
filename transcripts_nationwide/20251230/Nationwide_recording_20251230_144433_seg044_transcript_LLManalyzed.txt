20251230 144433 And the Lord asked me what I did with my life I will say I spent it with you If I wake up in World War II I see destruction and poverty And I feel like I wanna go home It's okay if you're coming with me My love, my love, my love is your love. If I take an eternity to break us, then I'll change up on stuff to hold us. My love, my life is your love. And if I take an eternity break us, then change up on stuff. Hold us, hold us, hold us.
