20251215 111107 Like this morning folk, we turn to road fatalities as Transport Minister Daryl Vaz has described the current increase in road fatalities as reaching a crisis stage. According to data from the Island Traffic Authority, 354 Jamaicans have been killed in 310 fatal crashes up to Thursday, December 11. Alfonso Granel, Managing director and senior instructor at Granel's driving school, will join us to discuss the reasons why this problem persists annually in spite of the government's efforts.

Yeah, it's an interesting period. Chief Executive Officer
