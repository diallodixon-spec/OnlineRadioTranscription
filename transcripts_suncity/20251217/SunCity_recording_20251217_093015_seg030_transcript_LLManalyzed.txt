Joe, Joe, Canada, you were saying that one of your greatest artists, reggae artists,ites, should I say, Tony Rebel and the Queen of Africa were partners for 23 years and they are parting ways. I thought they parted ways years, long time. I remember hearing this before, but I don't know if I'm wrong people to tell me, am I wrong? But I'm sure they split from long time, like a good few years now. At least one, two years they've been apart, but maybe I was wrong, maybe they got back together, but I thought they had split from long time like a good few years now at least one two years they've been apart but maybe I was wrong maybe they got back together but I thought they had split before all right guys we're gonna go for a quick break and then when we come back we have a focus on Africa and imagine this week we're gonna have Dr.
