20260101 140003 Every hour, every day I miss you like crazy No matter what I say or do There's just no getting over you I can see the love shining in your eyes And it comes as such a sweet surprise. It seems believing it's worth the wait. So hold me and tell me it's not too late. We're singing together. We're starting forever now. And I miss you like crazy. I miss you like crazy I miss you like you're crazy Ever since you went away Every hour, every day I miss you like I'm crazy I miss you baby A love like ours will never reach Except for times in the end, but never again
