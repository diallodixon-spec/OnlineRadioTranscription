I'm Janene Herbst. President Trump says the U.S. seized an oil tanker off the coast of Venezuela as he ramps up pressure against the country's president, Nicolas Maduro. The Trump administration accuses Maduro of running a narco-terrorist cartel, sending drugs to the U.S., but critics say it seems like a regime change. Richard Haass is a veteran diplomat and President Emeritus of the Council on Foreign Relations. It essentially signals to the world that in the Western Hemisphere, we are going to act, I'll put it diplomatically, with great independence. Some might say, critics might use the word impunity, to promote ends, to advance interests as we see them. And in this case, there's obviously an interest in bringing about a change in regime in Venezuela, and this is one way of escalating, graduating, incrementally increasing the pressure on the government. Richard Haas speaking there to NPR's morning edition. Venezuela has the world's largest proven oil reserves with about 1 million barrels produced daily.
