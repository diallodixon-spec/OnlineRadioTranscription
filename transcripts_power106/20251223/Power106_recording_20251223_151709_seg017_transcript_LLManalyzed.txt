20251223 151709 I just want to say a few things. And by the way, I'm saying this not because I'm afraid about deportation. For me to get deported, it has to come true. For me, I'm not fear anything about deportation, I didn't vote for Trump. I don't like how the man operate. You have some good, I just want to put that out there. I have some good ideas, but the way it goes about it, is not my cup of tea. But I love America and that's why I'm here. If I didn't love America, I wouldn't be here. And I love my home country, Jamaica. One thing I noticed though, Sister Althea, I want to try to be quick as possible. As long as you're not bashing America, you can't say nothing about Jamaica that needs improvement.
