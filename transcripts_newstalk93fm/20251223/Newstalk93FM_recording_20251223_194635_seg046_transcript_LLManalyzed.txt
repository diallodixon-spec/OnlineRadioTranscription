20251223 194635 We were vibed out. Caught you in the corner giving me the side eye. Wanna play, you got some rules, you gotta vibe out. We can take a jet and lay up in my high rise. Keep it real with you, it ain't nothing to lie about. Don't be asking, don't be pressing about my well-being. Don't be listening to the **** what they say about me. Keep it silent, you gonna ride till the wheels hiding. All she ever wanted was a real hood. She don't see no flaws, only see the good in them. I was just a dog with the wrong ****. Hit me when I'm lost, cause you see the big attention. Say she never met a nothing like me. Nothing. Give her six figures just to shop like me. Shop walk like me. Now she talk like me. Talk G63 about a new double C. Shark on it, shark on it. Say me no, I never lose it. Shark on it.
