20260102 210705 Come make we nice of the lawn Like how no shooting and no looting no one Come make we skank and come on Because we love how you skankin' up on the dance floor Black people, ninja love How you no skankin' once and you skank some more Lord have mercy Now there's no joke and no hate, no jest off Watch the roughest sound from about the area A lot of mercy. the city where you tear the whole of jamaica the sweetest one love was sweet like a sugar so like how the first thing i'm not fighting not one can't come moving on the lawn if i pay one blow
