I don't have a problem with the USA KFC still. I don't really say anything wrong with it still. But, I don't know. Maybe because me just run in and run out. You know what I'm saying? You know, sometimes you're just hungry. You know, when you're hungry, you know. You know when you're hungry anything, well no, why for the anything? When you're hungry, almost anything tastes good, right? So maybe that's why it's different for me, you know? All right, so Johan says, Alipatch, I would not know because KFC here tastes like I don't even know. I do not consume it for 100 years now. Wherever I go, people talk about KFC in Jamaica. Yeah, that's the same thing. That's what I've been hearing as well. What I've been hearing is Jamaica, KFC is the best.
