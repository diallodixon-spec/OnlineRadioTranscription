20251223 115225 No, I keep business without the thought. Lock your business without the thought, put it on the big screen with I code. Christine and I code. Them cash, get the money, cheat with I code. Rich blood, my thing never dial out, and if I don't count on it, I'll just keep the guy. No, I don't drive by to fly. Boil and slide, night boat. Sing more that you know I'm wild, wild low. Learn to stop, like flow. Vanish down, friend. Yeah. I try for you, man. Fight for truth. Man, it's on the mic for you. Man, Rich and the boy for you. Bit of style and I want no clue. Don't put a face when I move them. Bit of style, bit of soul. Pass, pass, cancel. Present, get a soul.
