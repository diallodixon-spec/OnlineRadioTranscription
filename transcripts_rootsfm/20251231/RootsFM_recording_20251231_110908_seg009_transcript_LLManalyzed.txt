20251231 110908 and we say gather and chat. We say gather and chat, right? You know, growing up, back in the day, you know, we used to only hear about ital food and, you know, it was Rastafarians who were doing this. Aylalu, you know, and then something with the coconut milk and other people. I remember when I became Rastafari, you know, I told my parents, my mother was like, oh gosh, my child is going to die now. You're going to eat callaloo and cabbage all day long? And yesterday I was in a group of people and we were talking about those days, how we come right forward to now and the variations and just, you know, even how we journeyed from the callaloo and the good ital sip and all those things from back in the day, you know, until now, what we're experiencing, you know, experiencing is a whole nother vibe. We're going into life. We're going to all kinds of variations of foods. Now, last week we had Ashae on.
