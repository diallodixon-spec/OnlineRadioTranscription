Tonight we gon' get lit, yeah Me and you goin' in So tear that piece of shit up And excuse you callin' boyfriend That he ain't gotta worry about you comin' back home Cause you done found what you been lookin' for all along Just a little bit of vibin' stick Now you on Florida time Now you so round and thick Slim waist, pretty face, you Florida pine So you ain't gotta pay for drinks, no more Cause I done found what I've been looking for all along I'm talking about where they rang everything No niggas ready, babe, as I take name to my love language And I'm saying what they say, they're bout to be like out of business They can map it in the club
