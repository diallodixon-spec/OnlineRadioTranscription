20251219 155128 You've been hearing this since October. I don't want you to feel that everything. I'm from October. Everything must be better. They still need a lot of help, Nada. They do. So we're doing some relief. We're doing some recovery. All right. Thank you, ma'am. They're always very polite here when I come to the Fesco. Thank you. So a big up to you and your team. Thank you. Always very efficient. I also have Michael Haldane with me. He's commercial sales executive Fes Gas. And of course, you know, Fes Gas, future energy source company limited Fes Gas is a brand of Fesco. Michael, you have LPG? Most definitely. Tell me a little bit about it. Tell me more about your LPG. So, since April 2023, we have launched Fiskeas to the island. We have now reached as far as Montego Bay with our product. We are in Kingston, St Catherine, and we continue to expand as we go along.
