20251212 212119 Sir Williams, you said the government had set its target during the suspension period but would the IFC have a role in advising government on policy decisions concerning spending during the suspension period? No, we won't. We don't provide advice to the government. Typically, Crystal Commission don't provide advice in that sense because if you think about it, we're holding the government to account. We are monitoring the government's performance and see whether or not they are adhering to. They wouldn't be prudent to be giving advice and then monitoring against those same advice. Okay very well and any any concern about our credit rating before Melissa we were getting good improved credit ratings from the international credit rating agencies any concerns that the suspension would impact those? Well
