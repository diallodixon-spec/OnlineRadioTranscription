Hey, welcome back everyone, welcome back. Alright, we're going to the phone lines and my brother, Jamaica Critic, is there. How are you doing, my brother? Yes, sir. I'm doing good. How are you? What's up? Yeah, I want to talk about something. The current Minister of Health, right? Yes. He had some health care issues and he went away to the US to get medical care. Yes. Now, to me that looks really bad. Why? Right? Why? Because you're the head of the Ministry.
