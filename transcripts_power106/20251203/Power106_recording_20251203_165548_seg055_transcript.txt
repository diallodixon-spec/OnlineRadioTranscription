The richest people in Jamaica are not Blacks, right? I wouldn't call them Blacks in the true African ethnicity sense. The PFOJ, do you think like Higgins, shopkeepers, members, do you think they are private sector people? Yeah, I do. So why are they not represented in the PSOJ? I heard the Small Business Association President Garnett Reid talking about the need to get back electricity to our barbers, our hairdressers, to our cook shops. No man, I'm talking about the PSOJ, the PSOJ you know, the Private Sector Organization of Jamaica. I know but they would be a major entity comprising on private sector businesses and operators. You know why?
