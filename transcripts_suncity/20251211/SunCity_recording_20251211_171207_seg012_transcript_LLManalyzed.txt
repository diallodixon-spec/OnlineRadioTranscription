2025-12-12 10:25:03 We now move on to international news. Russian President Vladimir Putin has reiterated his backing of Venezuela during a phone call Thursday with President Nicolas Maduro, according to the Gremlin. The show of solidarity follows rising tensions after U.S. forces seized a Venezuelan, excuse me, oil tanker, deploying troops who boarded the vessel by helicopter. Putin reportedly praised Maduro's efforts to defend Venezuela's sovereignty amid what Moscow calls growing external pressure. Washington has accused Maduro of leading a drug cartel, allegations he denies as U.S. warships continue to operate near Venezuelan waters. The standoff marks another escalation in a region already rattled by recent military actions at sea. That's it for our international news.
