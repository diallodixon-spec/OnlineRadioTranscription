I like you, and you, and you And you, I like you, and you, and you I like you too Oh, gosh, I'm in trouble All they got them pressuring me They think I done fumbled Someone who can make me happy But they're happy like poppy already So so they can choose Either way I can't lose How many girls say she got a man and him got a plan Still falling in love with Batman Many many many many many many women How many girl say she understand she in number one Still falling in love
