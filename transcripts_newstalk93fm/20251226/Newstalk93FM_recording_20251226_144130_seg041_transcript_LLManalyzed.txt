Sweetest when it rollin', rollin', look back when it rollin, rollin', things nice when it rollin' rollin', and I love how we feelin'. When it rollin' rolling, it bounce when it rollin rollin', can't stop you from rollin' rolling. Yeah. And then I look through the window I see she step on, she tiptoe And when you know how the thing is going She knows by the winter But just with this over me Have me begging on me knees Want me spend me salary. Granny say, yeah, boy, don't twist up your head down there. They gon' knock on your teeth and put your ass in bed. But I don't care, nah, cause I'm strong and I'm able, and I work what I want.
