20251223 155836 Hey, they better get used to the flex. African man, you see the jewels on my neck. Black James Bond, that's the new silhouette. You see me in the street and I was moving correct. Been running around trying to do the home run. Left that girl, she was no fun. I tie one, smoke one, big chief skeppy and I answer to no one. Counting my blessings, I'm feeling special. Birds eye view, SK level. Give them the shaku when I dance with the devil. Young fella could see the return of the rebel. I told her I need some space. Real busybody never stay in one place and she knows I got more tricks under my sleeve that's why she never wants me to leave she tell me bad man see I need your love see I need you love me need you close to me me tell her save me or stay on the road bad energy
