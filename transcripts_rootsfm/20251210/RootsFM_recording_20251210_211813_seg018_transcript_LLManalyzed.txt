============================================================

Now this mountain I must climb Feels like the world upon my shoulder But through the clouds I see love shine It keeps me warm as life grows colder. In my life, there's been heartache and pain. I don't know if I can face it again Can't stop now, I've traveled so far To change this lonely life
