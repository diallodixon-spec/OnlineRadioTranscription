20251231 194330 You are the captain, sail away Watch my hands on your waist and I'm trying to navigate Sail away, anchor down, let me dive in, get out of the way Sail away, to the ends of the globe and night around again Sail away, oh lord, sick of floats, I don't care what you do Throw me overboard, I don't need no lifeguard, oh lord Rocking back and forth like a tidal wave You are the captain. I don't need no life. I'm too strong, too strong You feelin' sweet like Nika Lipson Listen one stroke, two strokes You feelin' too sweet like NikaLipson My girl let me make you remember My girl, let me make you think My girl, let's make it all real My girl, let us make it dream Come to me, come to me
