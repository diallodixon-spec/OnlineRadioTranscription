20251230 155314 Keep it in real So all my homies working on the nine to five and doing right to keep themselves off out of trouble Keep it in real Although sometimes I know it seems impossible There ain't no need in clowning in your sorrow Keep it in real If things are as bad as they can be you could be sure there'll be a brighter tomorrow I never got to have myself the house, the mansion and the bench I'm not the kind of brother who be making mad ends I got myself a girl but we be kicking it as friends It's not enough, but maybe that depends again. Not everything you want is everything you really need. The standard of society's motivated by greed. Are you prepared to fall or tell that you're prepared to leave? So persevere and you'll succeed. To all my homies working on the nine-to-five and doing right to keep themselves up out of trouble Although sometimes I know it seems impossible there ain't no need to drown it in your sorrow If things are as bad as they can be, you could be sure there'll be a brighter tomorrow All the harsh realities appear to come in twos and threes, don't worry
