20251215 203523 I always look forward to this time of year To do what we all should do Spread good cheer See happiness on the children's faces People shopping and going places Good friends coming together No matter what what the weather. Tis the season, Christmas time again. So love without reason, families and friends. The holidays are finally here, and everyone's feeling irate. Sweet reggae music playing everywhere, and people going out to party.
