A traditional Jamaican flatbread made from cassava, often served alongside the Christmas meal as a side dish, especially when paired with fish and or other meats. So is it a yay or nay for Bami on Christmas day? Nay for me. A Christmas nay. Yeah, I don't want no Bami. No, I'm sorry. Curry goat. Yay.. Fried fish. Your name? Sprat. Yeah. Snap out. Sprat. Oh no. No Sprat? It's a no for me. It's a no from me. All right, guys. Well, thank you so much. But can you just tell us where they can find you on social media platforms and things like that?
