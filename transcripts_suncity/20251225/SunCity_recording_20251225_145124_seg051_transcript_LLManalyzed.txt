20251225 145124 It's good to be here again. On the streets there's children laughing. People smile as they are passing. Christmas time is here. Awaiting is done Wishing it could last forever Not just 12 days in December Through the year It's true to remember that special way That everyone feels It's the magic of Christmas Day Oh, and God bless you
