20251217 180305 Come and light it up Just a little whine there now Come and meet me at the end of the truck and we rev it up Say hold it, keep throwin' it back at the way you stopped us Baby no way, we could boast of all the pictures you want When you're ready, I could overshare Darling, you could overshare But we could meet in the middle and start a bacchanal Play in the middle here, what we gon' do now? Jam to a rhythm. Heat a carnival. What we gon do now? Start a wine on it. I say compromise on it. Baby,in' on the lifelike, snakin' out the grass
