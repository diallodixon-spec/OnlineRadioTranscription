And now you're asking me to understand And I'm telling you I can't Why should I care about your feelings? Well, I don't want to know I couldn't care less about your feelings Don't you know You should have cared more about mine And I don't want to know It really doesn't matter why you're leaving You should know You really throw away your life and I won't sympathize You've hurt me for the last time Got no tears left to cry, baby
