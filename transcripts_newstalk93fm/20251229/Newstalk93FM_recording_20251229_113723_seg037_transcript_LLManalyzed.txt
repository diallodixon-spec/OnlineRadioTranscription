20251229 113723 You too precious to me to only love you for the night. The feelings when me feel for you, you know that you're my type. Make my light shine bright, ready to sign the dotted line. I know you're anxious, you want me to touch it, girl. But welcome, trust me, I want you to trust it, girl. The stars and the moon shine for us, girl. You are my Isis and you're my Cyrus, girl. My love, love. Baby, girl. You're just getting my love. My love, love Can't just give you my love Love, love, sweat, sweat for real Love, love, can't just give me my love Love, sweat sweat sweat for real So many men that dream of my love So many men that work for my love. So many men that I kill for my love. Hey yo. So many men get that shirt for my love. But let me tell you, I ain't really got the time. The plan I gave for you, I'm too much of a dime. You really wanna get it.
