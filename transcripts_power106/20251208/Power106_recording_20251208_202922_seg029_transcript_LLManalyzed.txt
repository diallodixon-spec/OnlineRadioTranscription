I took that dollar and gave it to my daddy And put the powder over my body Keep on lovin' me, never stop When the lovin' drops, pick it up When the jilly drops, jilly drop When the jilly drop, pick it up Got a letter from Miami. And in that letter was that dollar. Keep on loving, never stop. When the love is out, pick it up.
