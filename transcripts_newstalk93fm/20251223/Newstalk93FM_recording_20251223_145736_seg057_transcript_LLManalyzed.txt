Through me here, a lot of bad things about Fairprospect High School, I was saying, God help me too. But at the same time, I was here, doing the school, I was saying like, I really enjoyed myself. And as I get the teachers, top teachers here at Fairprospect high school. So, can't speak bad about Fairprespect, you know, because I want Fairprospect.
