20251226 112619 Thank you for the love you give. Thank you for an unforgettable night. We will see you next time. Give it up for the band. And the dancers. I love you, Taylor. That's our show. We love you so much. Good night. You're listening to sleek radio 93 FM Sunsets, will they become regrets? Because they remind me of what we had as we entered the month September. I just want to know where we'd now stand. You're playing it cool in your heart.
