20251215 192721 I guess I'm not care about tomorrow. I guess when I care about tomorrow. Let's go! We do it first, cause them soft like ocean, and waves like ocean, yeah. Never see a phone sound, never see a phone sound strong. Never did I imperialize wrong people to make my move, and never saw me grow. Now you say me a hip, I know you're probably right, but you don't have no pride, I guess anything goes. Clear live my life, tellin' me a moon. I used to be that little kid, now I am the grown.
