20251225 101309 I could be the twist, the one to make you stop The icing on your cake, the cherry on the top It's heaven in my heart and we could find you some space I could be the world to you, the missing piece The extra sentimental kind of chemistry Some people make it hard with me, that isn't the case Cause I think it's so easy to fall in love So come give me a call and we'll fall into us I'm the perfect mix of Saturday night and the rest of your life Anyone with a heart would agree It's so easy to fall in love with the way I do my hair, the way I make you laugh, the way we like to share a walk in Central Park.
