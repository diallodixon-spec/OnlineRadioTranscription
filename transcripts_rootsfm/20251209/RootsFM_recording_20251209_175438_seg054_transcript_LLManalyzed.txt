Let me show you what it's like who you're livin' uptown When the banks fall down Then the world a way a get a ute And me poor you rich But when the polls shift Then the world a we a geta ute And me black you white But when famin' strike Then the worlda way a geta ute On that day when you trade your old droids For a grain of rice That's when you realize That the worlda we a Get do what la we are. Get the people, get the people. So tell me, stop oustin' slave, don't forget the people. Get the people. Remember Haile Selassie never left the people.
