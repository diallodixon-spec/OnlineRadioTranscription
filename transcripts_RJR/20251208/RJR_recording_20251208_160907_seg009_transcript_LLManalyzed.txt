For all the L you put me through I'm doing better, way much better I show all of you As a matter of fact, I got myself a new girl I'm doing better way much better I'm doing better Way better since you left I'm doing better. Way better without your strength. I'm doing better, even looking better in my Gucci dress. Why am I looking better? Because Jesus looked a reject. His name is Jesus. Oh, yes, he is. His name Jesus, yeah. Oh, yeah, he is. Hey, his name is Jesus. Yeah. Oh, yeah, she is. Mm. Yeah. His name is Jesus. Oh, that's who he is. Lord, I'm crying out for all the people now. And Lord, I'm falling out for all of the people now. So listen to my cry. Long live Jesus.
