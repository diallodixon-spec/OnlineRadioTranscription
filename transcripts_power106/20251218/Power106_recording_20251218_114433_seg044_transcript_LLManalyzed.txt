Forget about farming and forget about stress and the day-to-day thing for a day and get your mind at a place where you can think different, be more contented, enjoy what is happening. And this is what we need to do because this is really a part of supporting them and bringing them morally to right reach where they want to reach that's right because every day you walk around with stress they don't know that instead of going up they are going down so we have to lift them up morally to make sure that they do what they have to do and see agriculture as not just going day to day but something that they enjoy and to know that that is what they are achieving from. Right. You understand? They can put out more effort to do what they have do.
