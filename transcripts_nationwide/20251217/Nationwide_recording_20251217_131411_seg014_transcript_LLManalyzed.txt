20251217 131411 Good afternoon to you all and welcome to the Lascaux Chain Foundation and Jamaica Constabulary Force, saluting our heroes and chairman's award ceremony. We are pleased to welcome you here this afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and we want, of course, to begin our ceremony with Per. It is customary for us to, at this time, invite our chief chaplain, Pastor Dr. Gary Budu Fletcher, to bring us to the throne of grace. Good afternoon, everyone. Let us take a posture of reverence as we lift our hearts to heaven. Heavenly Father, we thank you for bringing us safely to this moment of celebration and decision. As we begin this Laska Top Cup competition finals, we acknowledge you as the source of wisdom, strength, and every good gift. We lift before you this afternoon the six finalists.
