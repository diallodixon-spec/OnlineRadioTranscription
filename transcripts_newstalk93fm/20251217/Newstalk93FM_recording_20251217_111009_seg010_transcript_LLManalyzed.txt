And what I see the system is doing here in Jamaica, it's make it seems like Andrew Owens is above the law. And then make him seems like he is also untouchable. But I am here to tell you lots this morning, Andrew Owens is not untouchable. And I applaud Mr. Buchanan for his effort because we know we don't last West Central, St. Andrew. The People's National Party do not last it. Mr. Buchanan did not lose the election. Let me put- I'm telling you this before- Go ahead, go ahead, go ahead Carla, go ahead. I tell you this before I go, you have an EOJ officer and I said it already, I will never forget this man here, Markland Burgess.
