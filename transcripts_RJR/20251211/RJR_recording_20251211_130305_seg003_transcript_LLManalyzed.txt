Investigations into allegations of assault against two Portland-based police officers ended on Tuesday, with them being found not guilty after a successful mediation exercise. The complainant accepted compensation in the sum of $200,000. Indicum says, subsequent to the confirmation of payment to the complainant, the Crown offered no evidence. Constables Carlos Douglas and Wayne Wilson had been placed before the Portland Parish Court on August 12, 2025, for the charge of assault occasioning actual bodily harm, following an investigation by Indicom and a ruling from the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions. The incident occurred on November 23, 2024, during a spot check by three officers along West Street in Portland. Indicum says CCTV footage proved useful in the investigation as the video evidence corroborated a complainants report of use of force against this person which the officers omitted from their report.
