So we had that bond. And it was a difficult time, but we pulled through with each other. All right, let me ask you. Hold on just one second for me. Let me just take the break and then I come back with all of you. We're talking to the victorious D-Cup team from Stets, Keith Wellington, Principal Omar Wedderburn, Head Coach Deandre Wright-Barnett, the captain, and Malik Wellington, vice-captain. We're coming back with them right after the break. Remember our WhatsApp line, 876-254-0693. Soon come. I'll see you in the next one.
