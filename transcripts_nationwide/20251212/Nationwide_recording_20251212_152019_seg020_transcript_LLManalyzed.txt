2025-12-12 15:54:58 Do you ever feel like a plastic bag? Drifting through the wind, wanting to start again Do you ever feel, dissipate within? Like a house of hearts, caving in Do you ever feel already buried deep? Six feet under screens and no one seems to hear a thing Do you know that there's still a chance for you cause there's a spark in you you just gotta ignite the light and let it shine just on the night like the fourth of July cause baby you're a firework time for the news oh my god I wasn't ready I wasn't ready
