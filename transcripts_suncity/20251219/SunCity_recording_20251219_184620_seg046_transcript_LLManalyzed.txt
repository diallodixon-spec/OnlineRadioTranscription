20251219 184620 I just touched down, when I see you now. I'm starving on the road, calling you tonight. I wanna make it you, make me no device. I don't wanna sleep alone. When I hold you tight, I can't fool my eyes. But I'll be alright, forever. Yeah. Baby, what's your lucky number? Give me your date. Tell your WhatsApp messenger to look on your page. I'm in a private party with Elisa, baby.
