20251212 205533 I'm not giving up, I'll be fighting for ya Can't believe it that you're leaving Can't you see that I am grieving? One mistake should break us apart Baby please don't crush my heart At nights when I'm ready to lay down my head Can't believe you're not here in my bed Beside me Baby come and hide me i'll do just anything for you to come home because i can take it on my own i need you baby i need you my girl is leaving another can you remember I can't remember. Oh she waited and waited
