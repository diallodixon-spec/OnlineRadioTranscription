Even the man who has everything would be so happy if you would bring him love on Christmas Day. No greater gift is better than love. Yeah. People, you don't know Smiling on Hello everywhere There's an air of Christmas joy It's that one trouble year When the world's sincere And you love to find a way to show you the things that words can't say Why don't you give love on Christmas Day?
