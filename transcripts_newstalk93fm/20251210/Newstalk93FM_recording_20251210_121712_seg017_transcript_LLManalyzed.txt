============================================================

When we all sign it, it's an ocean of love. All that we align up to the stars up above. Let we dance now, take a chance now, with me. Tell them we're not leaving Till the last drop of a canal is madness in the capital So I feel like I run in tongue again Jump and shake the ground again We're with only friend and devil No place like home, home
