For decades, the RGR Gliener Communications Group has answered the call in times of crisis. Through the RG Cares Foundation, that spirit of compassion continues. We invite you to stand with us and support our brothers and sisters in need. Please donate bottled water, canned foods, other non-perishable items and personal hygiene products. Items can be dropped off at our partner churches, Webster United, Hope United, Meadowbrook United, and Portmore United, between 9 a.m. and 3 p.m. Mondays through Saturdays, and at the Anglican Church of the Good Shepherd, Constant Spring, and St. Luke's Church, Crossroads, between 7.30 a.m and 3.30 p.m. Mondays through Wednesdays. We will make every effort to get donations quickly to those most affected. If you wish to make a cash donation to help us purchase additional supplies, please do so at the Bank of Nova Scotia, New Kingston branch,
