20251217 211308 We bring you a eerie Christmas. We bring you eerie Christmas. And a dance of New Year's. We skank and rock it to the rhythm. We rock and near up the rhythm. We scrub and we rub and we dub wise. And a happy dance all. We bring you an iry Christmas. We bring you an iry Christmas. And a dance on a new year. You rub up, you rub up on a Christmas. You rub up you scrub up on a Christmas, you rub up and you dub up on a Christmas and a dance on new year. We wish you Merry, merry, merry, Merry Iceman's On a broad pocket day, not even one cent to buy a little toy. We dance and rock it to the ice.
