And NCB is saying nothing as to when, a timeline, a date, a target that they're working towards to fix this issue soon is not an answer it cannot be an answer at this time be transparent many people have no say you can't fix the issue you don't know what wrong i'm sure that's not good pr sense but i'm just saying like people's money can't just be up there in limbo nobody don't know when they will get their money if it ever come back to the sender if it's gonna reach the intended party nobody knows
