Finally, by now you are fully aware that Jamaica has declared a leptospirosis outbreak. Please, be vigilant and protect yourself from being infected by the disease. Here are a few steps you can take to protect yourself. Avoid contact with floodwater. If you must go through water, wear boots, gloves or waterproof shoes. Keep rodents out. Secure garbage in tied bags and covered bins and clear debris around your home where rats can hide. If you start to feel sick or notice any symptoms such as high fever, headache and muscle ache, see a doctor as soon as possible. That's it for today's program. I am Monique Whitfield. Thanks for listening.
