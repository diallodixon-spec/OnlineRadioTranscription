Let's go! Let's go! Plans that ain't with me trying hard I've been trying hard to breathe in hell. I tell you what you've been doing to me see me again You should come through tonight I only kick it with a tap They won't tell cause they tryna live their best life too On the low, on my own I'll be waiting And me on my phone I'll be waiting
