20251231 150706 When last you've been to a party Girls wakin' up lookin' naughty And the DJ just drop a tune And the man bust up like wine up on a shawty And the room just passin' in my head Champagne in my eyes red My both hands up to the sky, I testify Tonight, I'm gonna go back home to my bed On the left, on the right, there's so much pretty girl Hung for the carnival, with a bag of green on me It's so critical Sent for the bag of ice, for these drinks all around me And we're having a good time Yes, we're having good time Just take the shot one time, come and enjoy When last you've been to a party Plenty women looking so nice We must be in paradise
