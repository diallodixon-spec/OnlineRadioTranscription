So you cannot determine. So if you believe, say you can go to the judge and tell him or her, say you know that my mom filed for me and I should believe in, so I need this case to end. It's better you don't bother saying nothing to them because the case is going to... Better not. Better not. So be careful.

So it's important that you recognize that some things you won't be able to get out
