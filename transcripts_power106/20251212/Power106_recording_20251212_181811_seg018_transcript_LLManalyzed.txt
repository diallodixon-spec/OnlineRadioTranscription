And I'm going to say from your first response in this segment, that actually we have a team of the field, no matter where they are on the group. Yeah, they get along really well. It's hard. I mean, I've said it all along, that's been our superpower. There's a sisterhood there that is unbreakable. And they go out there and they play for one another. And like everything else, sometimes there's going to be a couple of quarrels and bickering, but that's what every is and but overall they just have a tremendous amount of love and care and respect for one another and it and it resonates on the pitch and you see that they enjoy playing with one another they enjoy honestly going out there and playing for their country so yeah you can see
