So, yes, I do thank you very, very much, Sun City, for embracing our concept of Africanology. We sit here in South Africa, in Durban, in a place called Nkwale, another diamond place in Africa, which is where everything possible happens and everything and anything is happening on the African continent in delivering the message of unity, the message of awareness, the message of consciousness, and the importance of all Africans to unite. And with that, I want to say once again thank you
