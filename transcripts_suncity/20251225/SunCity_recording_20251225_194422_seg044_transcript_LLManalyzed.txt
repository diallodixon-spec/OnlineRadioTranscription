20251225 194422 It's a family Christmas, it's a family Christmas. We move in from house to house and we serve in Jesus. Christmas is the time to celebrate. Bring the turkey, ham and bring the cake. Everybody come and listen to this sweet song and music now. Everybody come together as one. Unto us as a king is born. Just hold up your hand and write on now, it's a family celebration. It's a family Christmas, it's a family Christmas. Glory, glory to God, hallelujah, glory, glory, amen, glory, glory to God.
