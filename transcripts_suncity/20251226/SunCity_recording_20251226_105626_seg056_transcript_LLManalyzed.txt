20251226 105626 No nothing see me walk in a room and start a fire, start a fire. No nothing see me walking around and start a fire, me set a fire. Me call dem a ass, oh a leaguer African. No, no, no, no. I go ignite the hola in a Vatican. But no nothing see me walkin' a road, start a fire, start a fire. And me shake, shake on the ground. And a bond, a shake that can come. And I don't know if you see me walking, I do my stuff. I can't fight, I can't fight. I don't know you see me walk, I can't do my stuff. And I can't fight you, I can't stop, can't fight you. Turn it left, right, just who I am.
