20251215 103831 yesterday I was shocked because Anthony and I have been speaking more and more frequently in recent times and the last time we spoke would have been about less than two weeks ago and he did say to me that he he was out for a few days but to hear that he is dead is was just shocking And you know, it tells us about, in the midst of life, they say, there's death. And you never know when your time is upon you. I want to say to his immediate family and the wider family of the RGR group, from all of us here at Nationwide, including our board, our shareholders, our staff, heartfelt condolences to the RGR communications group.
