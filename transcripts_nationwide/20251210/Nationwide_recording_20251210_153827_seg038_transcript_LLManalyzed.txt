============================================================

I'll find a way to you And even if the world's forgot to turn Even if the sun refused to burn And even if it takes me round the earth I'll find the way to you All alone as you look through the door Nothing left to see If it hurts and you can't take no more Lay it all on me No, you don't have to keep it the lock and key Cause I will never let you down And if you can't escape all your uncertainties Baby, I can show you how Let my lovin', let my lovin' lay
