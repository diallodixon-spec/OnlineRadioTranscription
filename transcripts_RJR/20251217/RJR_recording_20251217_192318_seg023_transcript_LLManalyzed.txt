20251217 192318 I run the scholarship program with a scholarship program that we assisted students. It's still going on. I really expanded it and took more children and I used to go down meet with the children at least once a year, made sure that they were getting all the things that we were providing for them through the school. And again, I can imagine, again, given your background, that that is something that must have a very personal meaning to you. Oh my goodness, of course. Because one of the things I always make sure is that these students, if they have to pick up money from school, lunch money, lunch or whatever, I wanted to make sure that their dignity was preserved and that they were not, they didn't feel like because they were poor and they were, they had to sit at anybody's feet to get anything. So that was a big emphasis for me, to make sure that they're dignity.
