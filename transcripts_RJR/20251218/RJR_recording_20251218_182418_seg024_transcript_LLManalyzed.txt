20251218 182418 So I'm hearing both of you saying really, no, we need to find a way to kick start the economy because one of my colleagues at one of the universities was saying that one of the implications of what has happened in Western Jamaica is that a lot of the students who may have been thinking about college perhaps don't see that path, can't pay tuition. So there are all kinds of different implications to what we're seeing here. The priorities have definitely shifted. We're in survival mode. We're looking to provide and also to rebuild. There's really no disposable income to do anything else. So that's just our reality in these parts. It's like you wake up one day and you had one reality and the next days are completely... Hours, in the matter of hours. What we have been building for years, for decades was just gone. For looking towards Christmas.
