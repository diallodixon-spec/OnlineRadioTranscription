2025-12-12 15:52:40 Let's make the most of the night like we're gonna die young You can't despair on me, despair on me You hit me like the sky fell on me, fell on me And I decided you look well on me, well on me So let's go somewhere no one else can see you and me Turn the lights out now, now I'll take you by the hand Hand you another drink, drink it if you can Can you spend a little time, time is slipping away Away from us so stay, stay with me I can make, make you glad
