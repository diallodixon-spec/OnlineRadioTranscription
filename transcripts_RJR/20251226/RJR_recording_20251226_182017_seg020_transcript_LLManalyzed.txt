20251226 182017 I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all, but I think you're moving too fast. Come on. I seen a rainbow yesterday, but too many storms have come and gone, leaving a trace of not one God to give and raise it, because my life is ten shades of gray. I pray often fade away, so I'll erase them for the seven days. And like this promise is true, only my faith can undo the many chances I believe to bring my life to a new Clear blue and unconditional skies have dried the tears from my eyes, no more lonely cries My only hope is for the folk who came cold with such an enduring pain that it keeps them in the pouring rain Who's to blame for two again gaining to your own pain? What a shame you're shooting aim for someone else's grave Claim the insane and ain't the saying time for falling prey to grime I say the system got you victim to your own mind Dreams are hopeless aspirations and hopes are coming true Believe in yourself, the rest is up to me, yeah Go, go
