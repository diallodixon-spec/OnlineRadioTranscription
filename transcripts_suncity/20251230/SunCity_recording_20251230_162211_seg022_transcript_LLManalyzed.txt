20251230 162211 Don't know where we'll go Don't know where to fade You make me feel, let me feel your touch Let me feel your touch Make me feel, make me feel your touch Feel the mission, sing out Make you wanna enter, spin, roll like a jam, can't tell ya Endless loving and it can't expire Oh, say, jaja neva anusa praya You're losing, you have to lose
