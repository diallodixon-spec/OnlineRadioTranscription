20260101 123615 Better than you Well, in miracle as a surprise Loneliness has opened my eyes I tried every love I could find Still I can't get you out of my mind Cause there's no one in the world to hold me No one in the world's gonna move me No one in this world can love me like you do, baby Every time I'm with someone Loving you, yes, I wanna run I wanna run back to your arms again Ain't no one in the world Loves me like you do Are you happy now with your life?
