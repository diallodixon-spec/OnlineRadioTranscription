Why are Jamaicans so fixated with Donald Trump and what he does in America? Why we don't try to fix our country that Jamaica be one of the best countries in the world? Everybody's talking about Donald Trump is a racist. The good book says that all nations love their own kind. So what we expect Donald Trump to say, oh, I like black people more than how I like the whites. you understand? He's a white man, he must put his race. The only leaders in black countries, look at South Africa. Who can't choose South Africa? The wealth. The richest people in South Africa is the white from Europe.
