2025-12-12 09:54:36 I never say goodbye Those tears I cried No, I can't get over it So don't you ever let me down again Cause I'm depending on you So you better come through this time Please hear my cry And if I ever let you down, my friend, it was a misunderstanding. So I thought you'd get forgotten. And I promise from today I'll go drunk like I never drunk. Wave like I never wave. Fire like I never won before. Just to show you I'm sorry. I'm sorry. And I need you back in my life. Look at people by the truck. Emotions running high. We are not in the sky. Death running down we hide. Can't you tell that we sorry? We sorry. And we need you back in we hide.
