============================================================

All this violence Raise a question mark Above our civilization Seems like we are at war at home And raised decades of the enemies I'm just struggling to breathe Feels like I'm suffocating No, I can't breathe No, no, no, no. Everything hurts. Everything hurts. And I can't breathe, no, I can't breath, no, I. Can't breathe. Somebody help me.
