20251222 214125 Change in life can bring good things When you're here, love's so supreme Close to you, our lips should meet To remember days so sweet I need you when you need me Very special Our love is joyous year we got naked. In my heart there was you, cozy. Love is life where dreams come true. And even though I can't have you, baby. Desires like these are true for you. All my love is all I have. And my dreams are very special.
