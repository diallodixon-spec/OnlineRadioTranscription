This is the main thing that we want, you know. Remember the Clash days when Cartel put out Clash music, you know. So we're wondering, are we going to get that type of lyrical potency again from Mr. Farmer? I don't think so. I don't think, so Cartel's bigger than that now. Nobody's bigger than the world. Listen, especially with these artists on this level, Bayview Ecotourism is saying all this fun and none of them are better than Sean Paul's streams. The streaming speaks volumes, one billion streams. Notice the reality, Sean Paul is still the best in dance. Yeah, but you know, the clashing and the back and forth lyrically is a part of our culture and dance and even, you know, just music overall. So I think that it's nice to have this sometimes because it just, you know, keeps the little energy and the vibes. Yeah, exactly. So it's not, I don't think that, you know, for them, it's not really about the streams. It's more about having fun.
