It's seven o'clock and I'm on my way Eating up miles down this highway You say that you'll wait for me To light up the Christmas tree Tell you the first thing that I'ma do Holding and squeezing and kissing you Under the mistletoe Girl, I've been missing you so This is the first holiday we'll spend Every night I pray that it never ends Feels like meant to be When I have you next to me Can't wait to have you to myself Cause I need you and no one else There's no place in this world I'd rather be Cause you're the only present that I need
