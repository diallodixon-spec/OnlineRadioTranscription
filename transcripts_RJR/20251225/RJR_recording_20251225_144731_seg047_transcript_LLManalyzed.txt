20251225 144731 What are you expecting to eat later on? Because I can tell you there's some cooking going on at my house too, you know. I tell you, I can't wait to go home, you know, because seriously, the kitchen is very steamy right now. So what grandma do with that? Mm-hmm. Where? Okay. Okay. I don't want to do that until Christmas. You can't start partake before the family. So when I'm ready now and I have time to leave, I have to make a stop in a town. Then I have to circle this place up out more.
