The national water commission and partners have already delivered approximately 10 million gallons of water to affected communities. The national water commission has also deployed 12 additional water trucks. These resources have been strategically positioned across the island to ensure equitable distribution of safe water. This will ensure the delivery of over 145,000 gallons per day to affected communities. In addition to these deployments, some 23 fill stations remain active across the parts of St James, Westmoreland and Hanover, enabling the continuous resupply to these trucks. And Commander Gale gave an update on the provision of food and relief supplies to residents affected by the storm. To date, the national system has provided just over 259,000 care packages to those in need. Our partners in food security, amongst them the World Food Programme, World Central Kitchens, Global Employment Mission have been central to sustaining the affected populations. To date, over 3.2 million hot meals have been served across Jamaica.
