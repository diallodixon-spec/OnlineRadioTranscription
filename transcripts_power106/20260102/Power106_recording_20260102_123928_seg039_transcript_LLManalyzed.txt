20260102 123928 Welcome back to Power Talk. We welcome you back with the music of Benji Myers. Yeah. I will stay with you until two o'clock when there's going to be something different on Power 106 at two this afternoon. So make sure you stay with us for that. This is from Scott. Work within the communities should be done based on need, not spread all over the place, making it ineffective. I will never support work being distributed all over the place so that the distributors can seem to be acting in a non-partisan manner. Finally, why is it assumed that because work is being done in a particular area, it translates to political victimization and not prioritization based on urgent needs?
