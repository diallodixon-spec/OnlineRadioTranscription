20251230 184926 It's been a while, let me know That did you end up moving house You're the only one who knows that name You're the only who does that face I just wanna know if you're okay I only have a couple minutes and already time feels like Back on your sofa Of course I still care Love's never wasted when it's shared And although it's over, I'll always be there
