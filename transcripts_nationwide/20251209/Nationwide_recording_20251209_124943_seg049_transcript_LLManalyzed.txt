I call back one day a week after. And then take it again and say you're going to call. I call back one week and two days after again. And then say I'm going to call again. Anyhow, I don't get a call. So I went into one of the office and the young miss call the head office. And after she call the head office, I heard what she was saying, but she don't realize I heard what she were saying. And then she turned to me and tell me that keep your fingers crossed by the month end, hopefully you'll get the title. That month end was from August. So me being the hypocrite now, because I remember I had done hear what she was saying. So I still went and I told her come to pick up the title.
