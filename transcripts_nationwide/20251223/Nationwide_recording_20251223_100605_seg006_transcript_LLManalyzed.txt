20251223 100605 weather climate we know manually is on a hill yeah so it tends to be cooler well this morning I really thought about what should I say on a morning like this before Christmas people are tuning you out people are in to the peak of the season. People are really concerned about how they're going to get a little R&R. Yeah, how they're gonna chill out for a little while before they have to go back to the harsh realities of living and working in Jamaica yeah so this morning I'm not going to burden you with the heavy stuff yes but one thing that I think I should really say
