1978 transaction the 78 transaction is also the genesis of the infamous Iran sugar deal as many are labor right have called out PJ Paterson on all right I like it thank you thank you Owen and yes Davin remind me to call Owen at the end of the show please if I don't remember myself Beresford says brother Jesse as long as the IMF is getting paid they don't care about corruption they love people like Nigel Clark who will suffer the Jamaican people in order to please the vulture capitalists Beresford also say brother Jesse we need to note that Michael Manley would ask any member or minister to step aside until any appearance or accusation of impropriety was dealt with. That's what happened with PJ and the Iran sugar deal. Nothing untoward was proven against PJ and the rest is history.
