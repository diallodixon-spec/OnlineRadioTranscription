20251218 200707 is dying out and they have to go and now compensate for the you know these offspring that need to be had so they end up having 26 children with weird names Are you still talking about tortoises? We were speaking of elephants. No, but this is a challenge. In my view, you really do see a lot of, well, especially Jamaican men, where it's almost as if your manliness is determined by how many children you can bring forward. But it's not necessarily a correlation. So what I like about the Diego story and what is my belief is that every child should be planned. Every child should be planned! So in Diego, you had 900 but they were all planned!
