20251216 112013 2500 persons were verified by the Ministry of Labour and Social Security Just you might have heard when I had the conversation with the lady just now June period and she said that it was pretty easy She went to the NIS office as the Ministry of Labour Social Security by the way, and she got registered they did their Check and their verification realized that she was one of those persons who legitimately was in need and of course, enlisted here. Now, I know we got some callers earlier on who were saying that they didn't get any kind of assistance, but you know, people can't just read your mind, right? You have the raw meat, you have to step out and ask for the phone number. Step forward and go to the NIS office, Ministry of Labour and Social Security office and they will guide you through the process. I hope you get that. All right, let me take a call. Let me see who's here. Good morning. Hello.
