20251226 161315 Cross my broken heart In your eyes I see What you mean to me You're my destiny I'm sending out a message A message so sincere When I close my eyes I need to feel you near Can't get you out my mind Believe in me this time I'm still in love with you You're my morning sun You're my shining star You're my number one Cross my broken heart In your eyes I see What you mean to me You're my destiny Cross my broken heart
