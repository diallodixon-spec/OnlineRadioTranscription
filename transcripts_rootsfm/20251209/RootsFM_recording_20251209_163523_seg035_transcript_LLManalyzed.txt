How could I break such a heart? You can still get my attention right from the start. Why do you compete when you know I got troubles in love? Why do you call me when you know I can't answer the phone? Make me laugh when I don't want to. I make someone else some kind of unknowable. You make me stay awake, and I should not. Are you so strong, or is the weakness in me? Why do you come here and pretend to leave just passing by? But I need to to see you and i need to hold you tightly baby feeling guilty
