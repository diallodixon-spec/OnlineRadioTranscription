20251222 161208 Now you're applying for a loan of $3,000? Yes, we'd like to buy a used truck. I see. According to this, you have assets of over $10 million. Well, I'm sure it's a lot more, but I had to put something down. So why do you need a loan? To buy a truck. It's got air conditioning. OK, maybe we'd better list these assets. Oh, OK, sure. Not that it'd ever sell them. Let's see, there's my wife. She's been a real asset to me. It's got to be at least $5 million right there. My boy just got his braces off, and hey, he looks like a million bucks. I don't think you understand. I meant real assets. What does money have to offer that my family doesn't? Well, it would definitely provide a lot of security. My wife's been with me through the toughest of times. What more security do I need than that? Well, still, you could buy a lot with ten million dollars. You can't buy the feeling I had watching my boy hit his first home run in Little League.
