20251218 092722 for a month now and I've been trying to call, you know, I can't manage the rigmarole and the phone I'm not good at like that but eventually I was shown yesterday morning I was in Manitoba and a friend showed me how to do everything that they say. All right, so I get through and they ask me a million and one questions by text and I text them back and tell them ID, phone number, this, that. And they know, they finally get to me after four o'clock yesterday evening. And they tell me say 24 to 48 hours before some of this. They contact me and that's seven days before I get back in service, minimum. Seven days I go take me on Christmas. I going to do the day after that? I don't have no internet. You're still on the yard and road? Yes, I'm not coming out now because the other people, when I left, from the last time I complained, nothing happened again until I left.
