For the times when I gave up on you I regret every moment when I never worshipped you Lord, I'm sorry for allowing them to steal my joy away I won't let it happen again Hallelujah, in the name of the Lord! Thank you, Jesus Christ, that you knew! Praise the Lord in the night and time! We praise, we praise, we praise! We praise your name!
