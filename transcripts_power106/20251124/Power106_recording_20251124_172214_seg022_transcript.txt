So maybe this is country music, but I don't know. It says it's a rhythm and blues pop chart. So it's one of the earliest rock and roll songs, 1951. Maybe I'll have to look this one up on YouTube. All right, so this one, I can't tell you the full name, but it's the Itching Camaro by Dead Milkman. Yeah, never heard this one either. I'm also not a fan of the Camaro. I don is the Silver Thunderbird by Mark Conn. Don't know this one. Yeah this is a very decent song because well I don't say the date but he's best known for his 1990
