You know I need to understand too, when you go to the barber, you know when you go to your dresser, you know, Ali Berry and Beyonce and them they have on the wall, you know. On the poster, yes. Yeah, them on the poster, and I say them B.B. are wicked, you know, because you don't matter what hairstyle you have, if you don't look like Ali Berry, it's not gonna work. So I'm going to the barber shop and I see like one whole post with about 30 different... Haircuts, yes. Haircuts. I noticed it's just the haircuts, you see. You know what I'm saying? You have a popular face. No, but no one... So they cut the ear to match the shape of the face? It is important to do that, but some people just want a haircut, and the barbers are not going to argue with you. If you just want a haircut. Right, because they're not stylists, they just cut your hair. Because I see some round face men and their hair belongs on a straight face man. And no hair. Some of them are round face men. I see some round faced men and I say no the barber should have cut your hair.
