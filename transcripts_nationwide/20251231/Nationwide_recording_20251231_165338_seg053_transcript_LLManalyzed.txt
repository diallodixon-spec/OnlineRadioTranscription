20251231 165338 Come know I want the truth Cause they call it me, call it you, call it I, call it love It's so clear to me what you see But nobody tell you what to do Well they can't just let us be happy They call it fitness Did you ever wish You could get back something That you made in your past If it wasn't for me, I know what we had We're definitely gonna last I admit That we say something we don't mean when we're mad But I realize that I've been foolish I never should've turned my back Cause it's a cold world when you're out there all alone So many times that I wanted to just pick up the phone And tell you ooh baby baby I miss your loving soul
