And the hairline looks different from the one that they work on, you know. It's a problem, jealousy. Our barber is just jealous people, we're gonna find out. So I want to find out from you ladies, how do you like to see your partner, how do like to see the men at your workplace? You like them groomed? You like when the beard is groomed up and neat and nice? Or you like when it's a little out there, a little disheveled there? What kind of look you like? You like the beard gang look? Or you like the clean shaved look? Why you like ladies? I hear some ladies complain sometimes today. They're like, when you're here, too stubby, it'll be a joke. Even when you groom it, you know. Even when you're grooming it, if it's too a little bit low and you don't like that one. Or you like when it's hairy, hairy, and it's soft, you can, watch how I touch up her face.
