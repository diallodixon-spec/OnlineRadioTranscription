and hope we can sort out any of the challenges we're facing. This one says good afternoon. My district's throne is right beside the town of Cristiano. GPS did it with burial and they're doing it again. Still no light. Can we hear why this area never gets light early? The town got back light a long time ago. With burial it was over six weeks of darkness for us oh my goodness how many weeks this time i don't know this is christiana i really hope they'll be able to sort you out before that you know um okay okay this image at the woodford street is saying it's a tenant school. Lots of people are living there. Lots of persons and children are without a home. And usually we get on top and share that with us and with the rest of the country about Woodford Street. And hopefully they're getting some assistance under these circumstances.
