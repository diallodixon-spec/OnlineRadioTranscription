And as it comes to the word reflect sometimes even the midst of missing someone, grieving someone, you just have to stop for a minute and look back at how good the Lord has been to you. All the things that he's done, how he's provided, how he's made a way and start being so grateful for those little things. When you start just looking back at those little things, you'll understand that, you know what God, I may be dealing with this situation, but I'm so grateful because you've kept me. You've kept me from January to December and I'm going to be grateful and I'm just going to, you know, expect the goodness of the Lord to be my portion as we approach a new season. And just be thankful in all things and see God in all things probably God did something for a reason you're going into a new season and he had to shake up some things to put some things together see God in all of it and the next thing I want to say let all things work together for good today
