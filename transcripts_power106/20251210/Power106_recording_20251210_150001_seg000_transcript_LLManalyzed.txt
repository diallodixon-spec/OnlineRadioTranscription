I think Clarence Grasspool was the first president. But it was far more complicated. Of course, the politics was always in the middle. For example, in the sugar sector. Sugar was employing well over 100,000 workers at the time. And the vote coming out of the industry was very important. But in spite of the competitiveness, there was respect. For example, I watched Michael and Shiro do Shiro work. You're a good friend. But they work side by side together for the benefit of the workers in agriculture in particular. Then we had Michael Manley in the box type in the aluminum industry. And Colonel Charles Senior was perhaps his main, should I call him, I don't want to call him adversary. Arrival? Because I don't think he's as bad as that. Right.
