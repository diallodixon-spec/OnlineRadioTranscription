20251222 124636 I've been wandering all day I tried to be fine but I can't bear The noise in my mind wouldn't leave me I tried to get by but I'm burning And behind my mind it runs All these thoughts are troubling Fighting to give up my pain Fighting to be on my lane My mind running to the other side When it's time to leave my life Then it tries to take me out Tell you what I need is the joy that you cannot waste And the other one price that you cannot fix
