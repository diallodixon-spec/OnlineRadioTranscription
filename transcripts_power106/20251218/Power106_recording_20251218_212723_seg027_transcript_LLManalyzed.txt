How can I be rich living free? I have to work towards what I want. And if I work towards the things I want, and I make sacrifices and say, that's a series of cultural, you know, you start to see a $20 or $30 balance, you know, find yourself increasing your savings. And you eventually one day walk into that bank with a million dollars. It's a cultural thing to grow in it. For the man who wants a little one room, don't pay any rent, live free, not going anywhere.
