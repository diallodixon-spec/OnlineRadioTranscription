Is it true that you cannot get a loan if the title came about. So they don't care if John owned it first and sold it to Mary. They don't care. If John got it by adverse possession, they don't care, if John's mother, brother, sister gave him as a gift. No, as long as the title is valid, a financial institution will grant you a loan. What the financial institution cares about is, one, the validity of the title, and dare I say more importantly, whether you can service your loan, whether you meet the requirements to qualify for their loan.
