20251222 163220 You don't like the fast life But look on the bright side, girl I go take the blame I just want you come and rise it up Just a little whine then I'll say Come and meet me behind the truck and we rev it up Say hold it, keep throwing it back I know why you stop baby no way We could post up all the pictures you want, when you're ready. I could overshare, darling, you could overshare. But we could meet in the middle and start a bacchanal. Play in the middle, hey, what we gonna do now? Jam to a rhythm, heat a carnival. What we gonna do now, start a wine on it. I say compromise on it. Baby, spend time on it, I say compromise on it Baby spend time on it, I said compromise on it
