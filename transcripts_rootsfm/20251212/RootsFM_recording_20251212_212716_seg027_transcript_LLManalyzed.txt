I have no place in Maryland. As I go, they make me victim of their unjust action. Oh God, I won't be conquered in this return. Oh yes, I have to stand and go strong. Don't tell me of your white God. Don't teach me anything wrong. Who the white God saved me from? White man or prey? I am no white God. It's just a black mess. A white God don't bless your inner bliss. Oh, me face can tart with anger. Can't start no right, no right. Hold all things, good and evil must be white. What about the black that did the most in life? You want your white supremacy? Watch me as you change the version of the Bible.
