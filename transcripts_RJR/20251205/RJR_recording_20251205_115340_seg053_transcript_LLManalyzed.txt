============================================================

Don't go out and confuse. Next time I'm going to carry you with me. I've seen a lot of people. But this, the lady before me, man, trust me, man, I tell you, when people are fainting, you don't, in whatever state, you find yourself. Hello? Yeah, I'm hearing, in whatever. The lady, when she's so grateful with all the things that she has gone through, she's still thankful that she is here. Yes. And so now we just need to get that in her head, that while there's life, there's hope. Thank you for the call. I just have to be here, that Miss Lucy and that gentleman is good.
