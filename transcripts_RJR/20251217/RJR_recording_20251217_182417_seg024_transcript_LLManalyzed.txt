20251217 182417 It was hard to find 25 cents, how difficult it was for transport to and back from school, from Mount Bay High. On top of that, I lived about a mile and a half up Mansfield Hill, and in those days, there was no electricity or anything like that, and school started at, I think, 7.20 in the morning, or 7.40, I can't remember exactly. But the point is, though, that I had to be up from 4.30 in the morning to get ready and to come off that hill to get a bus to get to Montbe on time. In high school, I actually had the worst attendance in the school in first form. The worst attendance in school in second. In fact, probably all the way up to fifth. And that's simply because you couldn't afford to go? Couldn't afford to come some days, yes. I would miss a few days a week. Sometimes I would miss a week. And in the worst times, I could even miss two weeks.
