Touch it, touch it, touch it Touch, touch, touch me, touch it Pretty girl, come wind up your body Ten toes, one girl, make it touch it Touch it, touch, touch, touch it touch it touch it Shut up and bend over I let your back do the talking over So back up, back up and bend over Let your back up and do the talking over I want to talk my life I want to be happy I want to dance and party Feel the rhythm of my body I just wanna party everyday, so ask me to touch it. Little girl, come wind up your body. Ten toes, one girl, make it touch it. Touch it, touch it, touch it. Why not everybody you know say me love you, boy?
