On the edge of your night, staying drunk on your vibe. The angels up in the clouds are jealous, knowing we've found something so ordinary. You got me kissing the ground, sanctuary. Share with me what you've done. Lord, return me to dust. The angels up in clouds are jealous knowing what we found. Something so heavenly, higher than ecstasy. Whenever you're next to me, oh mama Always in black and white, until I saw your light I thought you had to die to avoid Something so out of the ordinary
