I remember Norman Scott, the counselor, the mayor of a Spanish town. It was an assault charge, right? And then he counteract the charge and then charged the person. I mean, that's a complaint against the person in the polling station. And it was also, I don't quite remember if it's a travel document, it was suspended for travel or whatsoever, the case might, but it was asked on my fingerprint.

I'm going to come back, station bail, right? They're going somewhere, you must report to the station every Monday or every Tuesday or whatsoever the case might be.
