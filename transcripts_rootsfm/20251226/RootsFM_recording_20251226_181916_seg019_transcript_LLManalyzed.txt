20251226 181916 This has nothing to do with money or fame or vanity This one is all about self-worth So big up your chest and stand proud And don't matter about nobody No man no more than the man on this earth So whether you walk or you drive pure So if you're white or black like tar I'ma feel good in your self you're a star Push up who you to tell all the haters I'm a big deal You're my friend, I'm big deal Yeah, we're kind of important For real Oh yeah, I'm a Big Deal And my friends are some big deals Very, very, very important for real. This is Russia, love. Oh, well, now, now, wait here. Oh, love.
