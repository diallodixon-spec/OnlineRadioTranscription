20251222 110305 And so many persons do not embark on this journey. But I want to assure you that at the end of this session today, you will be inspired, you will be motivated, and you will go on that journey that we will speak about later. Remember, there's also a re-broadcast on Wednesday between 630 p.m. and 730 p.m., right here on Roots 96.1 FM. Additionally, as we go through today's session, we will have a prayer and that will be done by Bishop Dr. Michael Webstow. So I want you to tune in at that time, tune your hearts in to the prayer and to just seek your healing, seek your deliverance, seek God to work on your behalf. Many times we wonder how we will go through circumstances that we will face.
