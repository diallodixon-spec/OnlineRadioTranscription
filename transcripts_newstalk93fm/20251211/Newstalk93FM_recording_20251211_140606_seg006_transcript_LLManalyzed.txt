So let me see your hands up in the air Wave them up in the band People from everywhere Welcome up to the land of the party We love to party Cause life is to be living, to be living it A chance is to be given, to be given it So don't be late, the truck heaven can't wait We are team to celebrate I'm telling you Hard work without the smart work It's not worth it We don't want no batter that I need a little breather Two days on the road with some jam in the middle Divey come we need to find the middle For the sake of peace of mind So the middle of the road is where You'll find me and my friend and them because We move so hard, so hard Four weeks, ways up and far
