2025-12-12 15:30:22 Well I can tell you we just sent a message over to Delano Williams of the National Water Commission and I'm hoping that he can provide that intervention because they say think I am popular with certain people. Because I complained a lot about the road, this road of deterioration, where it's gone down to a track for a donkey road. And it was a road that was used by so many people, especially the people that go into the farming community ofy. And people don't even pass here anymore. Yes. And the road, no water is running on the road to deteriorate it more than what here it is. Oh dear, no.
