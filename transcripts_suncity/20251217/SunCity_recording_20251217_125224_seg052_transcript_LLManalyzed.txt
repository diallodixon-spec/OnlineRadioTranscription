20251217 125224 No, baby I'll do almost anything you ask me to Always willing to set aside The tribulations you put me through And people will criticize That you and me, they don't think that is wise And everything that I do That you're willing and able to publicize I got all bets on you, and waiting to finally receive my prize No matter how men rule, our future is growing inside of you Baby time is the master, we take blessings we will prosper I am placing all bets on you But baby don't take my kindness for weakness now baby don't take my sweetness for weakness please don't take my kindness
