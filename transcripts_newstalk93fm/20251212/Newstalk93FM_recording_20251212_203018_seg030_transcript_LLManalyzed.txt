20251212 203018 I said five in the morning I wake up to five of my yearnings The fear in my mind is a warning Pray to the one you're relying I've been wandering all day I tried to be fine but I can't bear The noise in my mind wouldn't leave me I tried to get by but I'm burning And behind the other side when it's time to leave my life then it tries to pick me up tell you what i need riot i really need i really need time now i really need i need a free mind now i really need I really need I need to free my mind now I really need, I really need my mind now
