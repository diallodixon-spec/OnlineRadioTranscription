20251216 173729 Good afternoon. Let me begin with you, Dr. Deslandes. What is happening at your campus? Is it out of control? No, it's not out of control. What I would say is that we have a problem we're trying to navigate. It's an issue that has surfaced over the last couple of years that we have reported repeatedly. We have had many discussions. We have sought support from the administration to solve the problem. We have done what we can do in some areas. For example, we had an excellent security company and the bill for that security company went from $23 million to $56 million in 12 months. And this is beyond our capabilities to afford, to have short help as best as we can. The reality is that the case has two major problems. It is a wide-open campus.
