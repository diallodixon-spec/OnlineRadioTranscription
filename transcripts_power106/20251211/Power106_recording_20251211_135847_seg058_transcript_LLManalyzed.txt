How much money we get donations in total? I'm not sure about the total. I know at one stage it was 1.5 million. I think Odpem had reported. The Telethon, by the way, produced something like 65 million Jamaican. The other bit I mentioned was one point five million U.S. But I think it's more than that by now. I don't know what the final figure is. I do know that it's finally time to call it George on the program. Thanks to our producer and technical engineer today, Davin Thomas. Thanks to you for your messages and your calls reminding you that the lines are now up and running so you can call from wherever you are. Both sides of the story coming up next with Althea so stay tuned for that and I'll see you tomorrow all being well.
