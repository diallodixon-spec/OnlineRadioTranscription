This is why the 150 million is so important, Ms. Nicole. We're in St. Catherine, you say? Yes. The plant, the pole, you said? Yes. I like that word, plant, because that's exactly what it is. And is there a number on the pole at all? No, it's some new poles that they plant. New pole. Yeah, because everybody around us, this is just three small districts, don't have friendship, panel, and seed amount, and everywhere else. And we are just in the middle without. Yes. All right. I've made a note of it, Miss Nicole. Thank you so much. All right. 926 8631. Are you there? This is the hotline. Good morning.
