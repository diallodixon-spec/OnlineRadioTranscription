20260101 120405 I've had my share Of life's ups and downs But fate's been kind The downs have been few I guess you could say That I've been lucky Fellow Jamaicans, tourism workers, partners across the public and private sector, and friends of Jamaica at home and abroad, good day. As we close 2025, I begin with gratitude. Tourism is not just arrivals, it is livelihoods. It is housekeepers and chefs, entertainers and tour guides, taxi operators and small vendors, and entrepreneurs of all types. It is families and communities.
