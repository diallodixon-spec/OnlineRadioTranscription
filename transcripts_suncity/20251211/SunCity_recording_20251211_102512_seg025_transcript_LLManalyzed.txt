that men, you know, when it comes to Valentine's and it comes to Christmas, that men tend to end relationships or cause arguments so that they can be an argument with a woman so they don't have to buy them gifts. It's crazy to me, if you're not planning to wear matching pajamas with me and take a photoshoot, then just tap text me. Wait a minute, matching pajamas and photoshoot? This is how badly they are, and they're desperate for love. So we stay up on the topic, they're really desperate. This girl will tell me, if December comes and I'm not willing to do a photoshoot with her in matching pajamas and pose up, then I just stop texting her. So I did such things, I just stopped texting her. No, hold on a minute. Matching pajamas and photoshoot. But that seems like she's trying to get validation from people. Because why you have to do a photoshoot and match?
