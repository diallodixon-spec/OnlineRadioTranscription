20251217 162923 So what I'm saying to you, Jesse. So there's a lot of police killing going on in this country. It is police killing, clean and straight. There are some out there, yes, who are, as gunmen, who are doing things that is wrong. And I can understand that. You know, so I am not, you're saying that there is nobody who died in this, in Jamaica, or not, some makers are gunmen. Yes And some of them also, maybe they're used to do things and because the police go out and kill them and put gun on them. That is what I'm getting on the ground. And I think, you know, we need to talk about these things. You know, police tend to come and kill people like just like that. It's not good, it's bad for the society. Because what can I do, you know?
