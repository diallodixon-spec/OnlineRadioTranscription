20251215 150204 And we never want to fail And in the great future We're gonna see brighter days Get the loot, hold up your head Hold up your head I'll do it, this system designed for your debt No matter what, don't give up yet No sun drugs, no cigarettes Things rough, well-trended By your enemies, but are you ready? Can't buy a loot till you get a retread Can't sit down and waste no time cause mama dead Oh No, we never want to lose We never want to fail And in this future, we're gonna see bright again One day, there is a will, there is a way And I know that I got a plan someday
