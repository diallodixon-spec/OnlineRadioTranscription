20251223 184128 Let me down So you better come through this time, please hear my cry And if I ever let you down my friend It was a misunderstanding So if I took it for granted Then I promise from today I'll go jump like I never jump Waved like I never waved Bind like I never wanted to Just to show you I saw you, I saw you And I need you back in my life You caught people by the truck Emotions running high We are not in the sky Tears running down we eye, can't you tell that we started, we started And we need you back and we lie, can't even come back Home, home to me, come home to me
