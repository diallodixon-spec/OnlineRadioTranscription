Do you know why they're affected black people are affected more so you know the men in prostate rather than other ethnicities? Right so that's a very interesting question and I have been asked that before so we don't have explicit studies to say why black men are affected. Of course we can say anecdotally is that men or men in our culture, we're less likely to have health seeking behaviors and they may be an association with our health seeking behaviors.
