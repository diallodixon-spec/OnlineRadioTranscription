20260101 105427 They leave your heart, you feel I'm yours for life Cause you're the one, you're the one You're the one for me Many years have passed away Since mother told me I would find a man to love, to have and love me There were many men but none of them that one good man I began to doubt that I would find my true love. Then before I knew what happened, I found you, love. You were like a true culture. You were that one good man. Someday upon that day.
