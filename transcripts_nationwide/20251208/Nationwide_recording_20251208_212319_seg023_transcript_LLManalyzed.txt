============================================================

You don't have to be a star, baby, to be in my show. Somebody, nobody knows, could steal the tune that you want to hear. So stop your running around, because now you've found what was cloudy as clear. There'll be no cheering from the crowd Just two hearts beating out loud There'll be no parades, no TV or stage. Only me to your day. You don't have to be a star, baby, to be in my show.
