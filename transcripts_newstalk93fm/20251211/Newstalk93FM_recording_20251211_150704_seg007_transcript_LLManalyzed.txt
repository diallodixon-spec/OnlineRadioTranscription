2025-12-12 08:49:43 I don't know about you but I come here to fight Come to play a match I don't live my life with regrets No, I come to jam on a bumper Come to drink all the liquor Until my head's gone And I'm miserable All down on the ground I'm causin' trouble Look how these security watch me They don't know I'm out there And it's much a big place And I defect like a jumby And don't wait They don't want me in their party They don't want because I do One way They don't listen to nothing they say Every fact I draw Jumpin' up to and what I want Jumpin' up Tell them I ain't leavin' Right there sleepin' Every fact I draw
