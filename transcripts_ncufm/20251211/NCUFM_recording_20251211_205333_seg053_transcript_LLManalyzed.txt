2025-12-12 13:47:15 we worship you and lift our voices to you my heart and my soul we sing for joy to begin God never said give and I'll give you everything you want He did say those who are generous would receive God knows what's best for us and he can and will give but his blessings are never one-size-fits-all God seeks to inspire gratitude in the heart
