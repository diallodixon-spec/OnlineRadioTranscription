20251226 191811 To the questions of life That I know in whom I have believed And he knows my name Every step that I take Every move that I make Every tear that I cry He knows my name When I'm overwhelmed by the pain Can't see the light of day I know I'll be just fine Cause he knows my name He knew who I was when he carried my clothes. He knew that I would fail him, but he took the long. He knows my name.
