So if we don't start to show, because you're spending the money, try spending it good. You know, while driving to work, I was saying, Johnny don't carry me down a certain road. With what? Because I was looking at the road, and I saw some screws start. And I said I said look here I hope these patching and repairs not done in the daytime when you go and slope traffic and cause productivity to be slowed down by people who are trying to make it from point A to point B to get some things done because now you're depending on this side of the country to carry the weight of the rest of the country that's basically not able to do what it is that they're supposed to do. So you need to make things smoother and more workable. So we keep giving advice, right? Can I give another advice? Come and give an advice today. Okay.
