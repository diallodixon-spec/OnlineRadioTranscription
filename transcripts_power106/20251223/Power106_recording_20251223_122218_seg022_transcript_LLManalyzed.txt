20251223 122218 BOJ says conditions are in place to support a gradual recovery in the coming years despite the challenges brought by Hurricane Melissa. BOJ Governor Richard Bowles says that although economic activity contracted sharply in the immediate aftermath of the storm, reconstruction efforts and inflows of external financing are expected to help drive renewed growth. The central bank notes that recovery activity will be supported by funding from multilateral institutions, private sector investment and disaster risk financing mechanisms. These inflows are expected to boost spending, create jobs and restore productive capacity across key sectors such as construction, agriculture and tourism. While economic activity will contract in the immediate aftermath of the hurricane, the bank projects that the funding inflows from multilateral and private sources will support spending in the economy over the next three years.
