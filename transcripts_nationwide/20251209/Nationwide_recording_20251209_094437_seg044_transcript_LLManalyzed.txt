You live in a compound town? No, I watch them on the TV. You can see the type of people who those people are. I watching TV last night and hear a man saying they don't have no criminal up there. So the people up there don't know what is there when they're looking out now and letting us know what's going on up there. The people get, you know, timid of Korean and his associates. And I want to tell them, yesterday when I was listening, laying down and listening, my station here, a young man was talking about brown shoes to get rid of Korean police.
