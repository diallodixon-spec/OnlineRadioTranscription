20251230 181307 I'm gonna show y'all the music don't stop for life. Glitter in the sky, glitter in my eyes, shining just the way I like. If you're feeling like you need a little bit of company, you met me at the perfect time. You want me? I want you, baby. I'm sugar-boo. I'm gravitating. Don't look away. We're renegading. I got you, baby. My sugar boo. I'm meditating. Don't look away. We're renegading. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I got you. Moonlight. You're my starlight. I need you all night. Come on, dance with me. I'll never see you. Moonlight, you're my star.
