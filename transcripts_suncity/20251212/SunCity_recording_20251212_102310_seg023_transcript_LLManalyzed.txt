20251212 102310 To live my life as an outlaw all along Remains strong in this planet full of player haters They conversate with death row full of demonstrators And in the end, drinking Hennessy Made all my enemies envy me So cold when I flow, eliminating easily Walk to their knees, they bleed for their right to bleed All begging me to keep the peace What I can see, closer to achieve In times of danger, don't freeze Time to be a G, follow my lead I supply everything you need And out to game and to train and to make a G Remember me as an outcast outlaw Another hour I'm out, that's what I'm about more. Getting bored to the day I see my casket buried as a G while the whole world remembers me. Until the end of time. One day, these broken wings, I'll need your hands to come and heal me once again. Once again.
