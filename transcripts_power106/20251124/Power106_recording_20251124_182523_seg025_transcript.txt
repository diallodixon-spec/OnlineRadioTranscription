============================================================

We had to dribble, to score, to pass, to understand the game. We were great players. Unfortunately, we had a problem with Walter Boyd because I think technically the most skillful players we had was Walter Boyd. And Andy Lowe, he did after a great job too. So it was a great team you had at that time. Great players. Talk about Warren Barry, the goalkeeper. He was the captain. He was a very, very quiet guy, but strong, very strong as a captain. This is what we need, you know. He keeps you calm, everything is fine.
