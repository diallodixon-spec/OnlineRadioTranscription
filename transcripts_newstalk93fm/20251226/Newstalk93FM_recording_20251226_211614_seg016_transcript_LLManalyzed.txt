Cause I wanna take a ride Let me blow your mind Right here from the passenger side It's like that joke I got the sweet and the spice And the everything nice It's like that y'all I got the hint and the lime with the cream on the side I hate it when you have to leave But I don't say a thing Cause I will absolutely get you
