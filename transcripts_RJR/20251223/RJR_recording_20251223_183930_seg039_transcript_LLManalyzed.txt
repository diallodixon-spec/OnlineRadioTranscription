20251223 183930 it really needed some blessing or we still need some blessing especially now with all that's happening you know but I wanted to write something that could remind us as Jamaicans who we are what we're capable of and just something that can ground all of us with the anthem and everything you know because you know in times like these when parts of Jamaica look unrecognizable we have to be reminded of the real beauty and glory of Jamaica because it's ours and we have to be nurturing it. Darkest night, never leave us or forsake us So lead us into brighter days You'll never leave us nor forsake us Lead us into brighter days
