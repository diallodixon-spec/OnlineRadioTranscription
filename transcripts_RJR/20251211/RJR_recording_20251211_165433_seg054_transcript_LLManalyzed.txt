Um offering his support to the SMEs, you know, that's how we do it. Yeah, the group, you know, I love that business. Yeah, we're there for them. I was just saying that I love the fact that whether we're inside the studio on a Thursday or we are outside wherever we are booked for our outside broadcast, you can expect TV to be accompanying radio as well. It's a big, big boost for any business for sure. Always, always. Uh we said Jamaica, you know. Yeah, man. You know, we name, we can't do anything else and it's really, really our pleasure to do so. Wanna thank you guys for tuning in. Um on radio.
