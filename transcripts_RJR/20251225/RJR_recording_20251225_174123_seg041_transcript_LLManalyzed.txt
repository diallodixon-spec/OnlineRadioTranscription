Outside the snow is falling and friends are calling you who. Come on, it's lovely weather for us sleigh rides together with you. Giddy up, giddy up, let's go. Let's hook up the show. We're riding in a wonderland of snow. Giddy-up, giddy-up, let's grab. Just holding your hand. We're glad you're not alone with the song of a wintery fairyland. Our cheeks are nice and rosy and comfy cosy are we. Let's snuggle up together like two birds of a feather would be.
