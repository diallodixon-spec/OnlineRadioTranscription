20251219 124231 All right. And for the last time, my cruising family, thank you. Thank you, thank you, thank you for sailing with me today. I must thank my second mate, Abigail Bethune, the brilliant producer behind Cruisin', as well as the new sports and current affairs team. Beloved cruisers, we've come to the end of another cruise with me as your captain, Tiffany Johnson. We've dropped anchor and it's time to disembark. But do not despair. Your life is like a cruise and whenever the rough seas appear, do not forget that the captain is right there in the boat with you. God bless and Godspeed until the next time we meet again. Take care. Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful. Thank you so much, Stephanie. I'm sure your listeners are going to miss you so, so much. We here are going to miss so I can just imagine. It's bittersweet.
