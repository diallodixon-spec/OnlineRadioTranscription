20251219 183424 I've got sunshine on a cloudy day When it's cold outside I've got the month of May. I guess you say, what can make me feel this way? My girl, my girl, my girl. Talking about my girl. My girl. I've got so much fun in the bees and the bees. I've got a sweeter song than the birds in the trees.
