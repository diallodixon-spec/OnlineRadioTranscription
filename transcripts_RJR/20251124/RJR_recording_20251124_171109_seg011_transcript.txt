Reacting to his death, Prime Minister Dr. Andrew Holness said he was a true cultural giant whose music carried the heart of the nation to the world. Dr. Holness said through his timeless songs, Jimmy Cliff told Jamaica's story with honesty and soul. Prime Minister Holness said his music lifted people through hard times, inspired generations, and helped to shape the global respect that Jamaican culture enjoys today. In the meantime, Entertainment Minister Olivia Green just says the transition of a cultural icon represents a major loss for Jamaica and the world. He gave so much of his life to delivering music which had a peculiar and relevant message and resonated in every corner of the globe. I spoke this morning with Jim Eclipse's wife and conveyed my personal condolences and that of the government of Jamaica following his passing. He died at approximately one this morning in hospital.
