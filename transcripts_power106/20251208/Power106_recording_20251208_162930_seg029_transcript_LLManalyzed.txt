One month. They said by what time you should start seeing some improvement. They didn't tell me that and I didn't understand to ask that. So you may have to just continue taking the eye drops as prescribed and when you have that follow-up you make sure you have all your questions. So you can get them answered and that will ease some concern and the anxiety that you may be facing. Yeah, I like to put my problem and the way that it's shown all over the world. Yes, man. I understand. And I even looked up a number for the Southern Regional Health Authority myself. So if you call me back by next week or so, I'm giving a bit of time right because you need to continue taking those eye drops okay but um just just just continue to keep us up to date in terms of your progress yes all right and I'm glad to hear from you I'm happy to hear from you as well I'm happy you got that that surgery done
