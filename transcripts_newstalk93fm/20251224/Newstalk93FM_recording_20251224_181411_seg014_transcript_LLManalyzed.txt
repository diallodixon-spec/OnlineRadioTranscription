20251224 181411 I feel your frequency from miles away. You come alive with one wine, baby. With you I want to dance the night away. One jam's in a lifetime, baby. So don't feel away. You don't like the fast life. I look on the bright side, girl. I go take the blame. I just want you to come and bite the top Just a little winding up Come and meet me behind the truck and we rev it up Whole day, keep throwing it back at the way you stop
