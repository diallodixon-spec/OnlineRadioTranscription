I'm down to do the little things Just wanna take some time to thank you And let you know just how you make me proud The good times make up for the bad ones I see you trying and I don't know how You keep up with me when you work and switch your timing When our schedules aren't aligning That's a sign, that's a sign That it's okay to finally tell the world That you are more than enough, enough, enough Right when you're waking up Breakfast on the table, know you like Eggs and then all scrambled up Pancakes, bacon, no j're on the side Pack your bag with extra clothes, you're too fresh and the Louis told love knows for when you on the road Cleaned your watch and cubed a link, took pillowcase for you to take Boy, you deserve that little thing
