20251219 131315 You said it on this program before that when it comes to Venezuela and their dictators and their socialist ways that America should intervene and has intervened in the past and I say bollocks to that. Okay, let me just say this. I have one more quick point to make. First of all, let me say this to you. Every time America intervenes in a country, I support it. That's like saying Jamaica has nice water. When I ask you to say something nice about Jamaica, you say the scallion used to smell nice. But most of the time you call it's all about negative. So when you say it's not every time America intervenes that you agree with it, that don't amount to a hill of beans. You believe in American exceptionalism and intervention.
