It's a nuance, I'm not sure where we got it from. I can check it out with our linguists. But you know, like the Spanish, the people who speak Spanish as a first language, they have very great difficulties pronouncing the letter S by itself at the beginning of a word.

But my problem is like, when we go to the car park, to, you know, like a family member, we don't know the time we're going to spend there. Sometimes it will be, sometimes it won't.
