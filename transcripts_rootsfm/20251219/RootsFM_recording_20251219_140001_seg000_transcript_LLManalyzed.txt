20251219 140001 So on behalf of DJ Strikup and INININI, we're out. We're really out. I love you now. The time brought to you by the Nangapong sovereign maroon global government is 2 o'clock at a 6.1 FM owned and operated by the mustard seed communities giving voice to the voiceless. This and every Tuesday at 11 a.m. Route 96.1 FM takes you to the bar with our attorney-at-law, Venise Brown. Join me, Venise Brown, at the bar as we break down legal issues which may affect you, the listener.
