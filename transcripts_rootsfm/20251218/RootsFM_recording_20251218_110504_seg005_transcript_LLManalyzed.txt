20251218 110504 Because people are trying to win whatever they can win from anyone. Including myself, you anybody. Because they will try to scam me as a police. Can you imagine? Most less you. Because if they are scamming me, they call me on the police phone. This is senior superintendent, Campbell, call me back, call me back. No, the culture of the JCF, no senior soup not calling the JCF phone and I ask you to call him back, call him back. No, no go so because we're not cultured that way. So for a senior soup to call the landline and telling me to call him back something is wrong. Because you hear them say the phone hook up straight, your phone are straight so they don't have credit where soon finish so for you to tell me that i need to call you back then my my chip bug now come right up because something is wrong right there so i call back the soup
