That's a sound of the whispers for you. The Scott Brothers, yeah. Love is where you find it. When you find it, keep it in your heart. Keep it alive and well. As we take it down to break, we got more to take us up to Newstime. It comes at about 10 o'clock, but for right now, it's got some. Love is where you find it. Ooh, put your heart inside it. There is no rhyme or reason. It just comes and makes you feel good.
