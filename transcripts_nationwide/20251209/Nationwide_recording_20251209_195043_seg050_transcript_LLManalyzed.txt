I'm happy to hear that you're optimistic about your getting back water soon because, I mean, that's one of the most difficult things to live without. I think outside of electricity, I think the two most important things for a man to live a good life without complaints is water and plumbing. Thank you, East Central. You can just call me Ricardo East Central, but yes, go ahead. I have to provide a platform so most of us can get updated what is happening right across the country because it's needed to update family and friends who has been in touch with loved ones in the past month of Melissa so this is a plus for in and around community and the wider community who hasn't been in the space to get a general breakdown what is taking place in the space. Thanks very much.
