**Interview with Janelle**

In a recent interview on Roots 96.1 FM, host DJ String sat down with Janelle to discuss her plans for Christmas Day. Janelle shared that she would be celebrating her friend Love Divine's birthday the day before Christmas and was planning to take her out for a party. When asked about her Christmas plans, Janelle mentioned that she would be cooking a meal, but since her friend is a vegetarian, she would have to prepare something special.

Janelle also talked about her upcoming performance at the Wicky Wacky Festival in February, where she would be singing alongside other artists, including Turbulence and I'm Maru. She expressed her excitement about the event and encouraged listeners to come out and support.

The conversation took a lighthearted turn when DJ String asked Janelle about her gift for him, and she jokingly replied that she was the gift. DJ String playfully responded, saying that he would just stand there and smile at her.

As the interview came to a close, DJ String thanked Janelle for being a part of the show and wished her all the best in her endeavors.

**Interview with Carlton**

In another interview on Roots 96.1 FM, host DJ String spoke with Carlton about his plans for Christmas Day. Carlton shared that he would be resting and possibly cooking up some food. However, he mentioned that his partner does not cook pork in the house, which is his favorite dish.

The conversation took a humorous turn when Carlton talked about how he would have to cook his pork on the street or at his own house, rather than at his partner's house. DJ String laughed and said that he couldn't blame Carlton's partner for not wanting pork cooked in the house.

Carlton also shared that he would be heading to the country the next day and mentioned that he was currently driving on the highway, having just bypassed River Road. The interview ended with DJ String wishing Carlton a safe trip and a happy Christmas.
