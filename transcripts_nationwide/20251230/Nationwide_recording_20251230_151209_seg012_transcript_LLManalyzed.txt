20251230 151209 Thank you for what you have done I never turned my back on you for anyone I've got so much love in you baby I've got sooo much love Oh, no, my baby These words keep a secret It's only we know And how long can they keep it? Cause we too lost, we lose control We too shadows, chasing rainbows The eye closed windows, the eye closed windows
