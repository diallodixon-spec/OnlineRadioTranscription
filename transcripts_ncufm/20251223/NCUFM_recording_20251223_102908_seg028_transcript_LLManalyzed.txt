20251223 102908 I decided to make Jesus my choice. Yes, my choice. You know the road is rough, and the going gets tough, and the hills are hard to claim. I started out, oh, a long time ago, and I've made up, I've made up my mind. Yes, Jesus' strong arms wear no tempest getting high. Yes, I'm saved and secure. I've decided to make Jesus my trust, oh my trust Hallelujah!
