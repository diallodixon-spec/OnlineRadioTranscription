When we're out here, you're out, you know. There was a lady who said something bad about our food. I don't see her back on social media. When Jamaica's rub you out, like proper rub you out. You feel like you need to take a hiatus from the space. Especially when it comes from nowhere. Like we're here living in our land of sun, sea, sand, salt, fish, everything. And out of the blue, you just jump and say, oh, Jamaica, whatever, whatever. It's just like, come on. Yeah. Come on. I think it was COVID and he was talking about you know viruses and their their origins and whatever and he must say you're never going to hear someone come from Jamaica.
