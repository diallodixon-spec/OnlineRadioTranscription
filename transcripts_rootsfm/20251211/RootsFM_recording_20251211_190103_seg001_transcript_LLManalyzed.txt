2025-12-12 04:55:25 To tell you that it's you You're everything I ever dreamed Would come to me Somebody walked into my heart And to my surprise Somebody's tearing me apart and it feels just fine And it's you I've waited oh so long to say to you You're everything I ever dreamed And tonight I gave into the feelings Tonight I gave into the thrill of loving you
