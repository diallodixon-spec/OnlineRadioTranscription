20251224 184529 I don't want a lot for Christmas. There is just one thing I need. I don't care about the present. I only need the Christmas tree. I don't need to end my stocking. Live upon the fireplace. Santa Claus won't make me happy. With a toy I don't miss a thing. I just want you for my own More than you could ever know Make my wish come true For all I want for Christmas
