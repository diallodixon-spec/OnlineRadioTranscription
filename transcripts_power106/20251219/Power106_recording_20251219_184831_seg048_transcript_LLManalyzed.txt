20251219 184831 round of games over this weekend i should say the 17th round of games by the way early in harland i scored 17 goals and tiago brenford 11 so now in terms of points i'll list this now arsenal is out front after 16 games 36 points manchester city 34 points great aston Villa, third on 33 points. Chelsea is fourth, 28 points. Now, with Chelsea fourth on 28 points, no matter what happens tomorrow, the top three will be in the top, what happens over the weekend, I should say, the top three, will be very much intact. Because Chelsea, if they win, will only move to 31 points. So 36 for Aston, 34 for Man City, 33 for Aston Villa. That will remain the top three. The order could change though at the end of the round. We shall see how that goes.
