For the third time this week I think I'm gonna have to call in sick If I leave you now I'll be losing my mind I hope we never get tired And I never have to go to work No one knocking on the door Disrespecting the noticed girl Sorry, no baby crying And with no horn blowing Just the whisper of our voices all day long A man who don't switch with his woman He's surely wasting a lot of time She might not say it but she needs tenderness
