20251224 105825 My people don't fight Don't worry, my people don't you ever forget Give just the glory With every single step that you take now So don't you worry, my people Don't you ever ever forget, no, no, no. Give God the glory with every single breath that you take now. God love, higher than the mountains, is deeper than the rivers, wider than the valleys. Oh, yeah, John, love, share with everybody, your mommy and your granny, the little baby in the valley.
