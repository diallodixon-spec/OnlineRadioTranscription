I'm on the tip of my mind to face reality all the time, woah Many a sorrow, many a joy Never you try to take life for a toy Some are the good lords, I'm doing bad And this kind of bad doing's driving me mad Cause when sunshine today I go on my knees and pray I said Lord, send me tomorrow I said Lord, let me have joy Never let me have sorrow
