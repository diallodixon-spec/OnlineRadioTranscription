Hi, Mr. Mullings. a situation with the two major intersections in Harbour View. I think it's creating a serious problem and I think we need to be a bit more proactive. It's the intersection of what is known as Fort Nugent Drive and Seashore Place. That is closer to the shopping centre area. And across the other side of Harbour View is Luna Drive and Southern Cross Drive.
