20251225 104124 I'm making a wish on stars above So I can be with the one I love Cause it don't feel like Christmas time without you It's no place of hope I'm falling down And my heart beats but there's no. Cause it don't feel like Christmas time without you. I pray the angels watch over you. Yes, baby. Until you're back in my arms. Ooh, struggle hard. See, I don't need no miracles. Oh just need you, baby. And to be wherever you are. Oh, yeah. We've got forever to stay.
