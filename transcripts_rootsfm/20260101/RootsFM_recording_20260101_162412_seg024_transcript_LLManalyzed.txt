20260101 162412 I'm fighting it's gonna be better. I now for poor people. It's gonna be better if you put God in front of you. Poor people. More problem to be with children then. Rich people, you figure them have no problem. Poor man look what them turn around and use him. It must be better in South Africa. It got to be better down in Jamaica. It must be better down in Liberia. It has to get better in Ethiopia. So as this world keep turning the world remains the same. People of this world keep changing.
