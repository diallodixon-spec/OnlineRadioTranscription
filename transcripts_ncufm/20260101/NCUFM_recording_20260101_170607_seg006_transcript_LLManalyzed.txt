20260101 170607 JPS has rolled out a new emergency power solution to restore electricity to sections of St. Elizabeth following extensive damage from Hurricane Melissa. The system, dubbed Magatee Island, allows electricity from the Magatee hydroelectric plant to be fed directly into isolated communities whose main transmission lines were destroyed in the storm. About 2,000 customers have already been reconnected through the initiative, including residents of Magatee, along with critical facilities such as the La Covea police station, water and telecommunications sites. JPS says the project has helped push national restoration levels to 90% alongside other emergency measures, including the mobile power units, which were launched last week and are now operating in Treasure Beach. The company says crews worked into the new year as they tackled the most difficult phase of restoration. Still in the news, Jamaica has recorded 673 murders for 2024.
