20251226 102624 No, no, let's have a mood. Make just a walk on the truth. Gonna make me rock and groove. Them say, oh, yes, I show off. Oh, yes, I hype. True, you're up late to lock your neck in all your life. Now, you're used to so fighting all day, all night. Oh, tell me myself after the rest of my life. Show up, make sure you grow up. Live a good life, step to if you keep up. I'm good, so please let me lay back. You see the trouble, let me leave that. Some bright color socks, tight mat, but I'm not going to wear no flip flops. Cause nothing now mess up my mood. I'm just a walk in the mood. Don't make me rock and move. Nothing now mess my mood. I just a walk and go through.
