20251231 195427 The people that tear each other down. Tear each other down. I try to run away from trouble. I'd rather flee the town. Flee the town. I would say friends and then we say family. Genuine love and adios. I would say life so we're living up happily. Genuine loving adios. Oh, oh, oh, oh Celebrate your good friends Put your hands up in the air, cause we're friends. I love them. They're like family. When trouble comes, they'll be beside you. Real friends. Always standing by, just like family.
