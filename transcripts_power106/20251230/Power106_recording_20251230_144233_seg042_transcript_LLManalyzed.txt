20251230 144233 Alright, thank you. Thank you very much, Michael. 876-922-411225. Alright, this message says... Oh, this is from Richard. This is from Mackenzie. Michael was in the coffee producing business. How much would you buy a box of coffee for and he also says considering container housing what's its hurricane resilience like specifically what category of hurricane can it handle and will it be safe in a storm like like like a hurricane those are very interesting questions you've asked there Richard we're going to do the research for you and tell you. What I do know is that we saw in the aftermath of Beryl the winds lifting those containers. It's very interesting.
