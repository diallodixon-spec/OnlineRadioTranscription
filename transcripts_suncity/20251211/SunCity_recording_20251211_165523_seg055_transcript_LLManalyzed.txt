2025-12-12 10:04:13 I can't wait another minute for your love Sometimes I feel so alone, baby, yeah I call your heart but there's no one at home Taking a toll on my pride, pride I'm reaching out but there's no-one inside You know it doesn't feel right when I look in your eyes. I know love is blind, but the heart doesn't lie. I'll ask one more time, baby.
