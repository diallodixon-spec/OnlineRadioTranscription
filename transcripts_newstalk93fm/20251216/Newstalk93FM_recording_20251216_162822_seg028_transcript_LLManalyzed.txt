20251216 162822 Guess it's bye to the good times. I'll be gone by the sunrise. I'll be better on my own. I'll better on my own, na na. Nobody should call my phone, nobody should call my phone. Na na. This is my last heartbreak song, this is my heartbreak song. Na na. I'll be good on my own, I'll be good to my own. Na na. Why are you so quick to leave When we both can make it worse When I'm gone, I'll make you nervous If you hurt me, I deserve it I've been acting foolishly Forgetting what you were You start loving me, I know this But even chaos serves a purpose It feels good to love somebody And somebody loves you back So don't give in to your chains, boy Cause I'll be here for a lifetime You don't have to pretend you care
