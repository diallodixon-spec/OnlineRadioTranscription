from the report of the incident. Prime Minister Dr. Andrew Holness says there have been no new incidents of gang intrusion or extortion at Logistics Hub project sites in St Catherine and has praised the security oversight provided by the police. Dr. Holness says he is satisfied with the strong posture taken, particularly following the swift action at the rain tree development Caymanistah State in Ferry Pen, where attempts by criminal actors earlier this year were immediately stamped out. He was speaking on Tuesday while touring the Lake Spen Industrial Park, one of several major logistics developments now taking shape along the Mandela Highway Corridor. The Prime Minister received a comprehensive operational briefing from Assistant Commissioner of Police Christopher Phillips in charge of Area 5 and Acting Senior Superintendent Troy Wilhorton. So far we have not had any incident since the last incident with Rintree development.
