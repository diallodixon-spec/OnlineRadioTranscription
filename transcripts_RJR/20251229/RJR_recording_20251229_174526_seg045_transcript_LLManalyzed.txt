20251229 174526 Tracy? Hey, girl, what's up? So, hold on. Why you look so vexed this early? They ain't just that. Lisa, it is so good to see you. But sorry you catch me like this, girl. My uncle sent one by a lot when my family go for clarity. You don't want to hear the price the people then put on the something. Make matters worse, me here say half of the thing they're missing. And me no say a custom. Girl, oh, you not see any customs? Lisa, stop going like you don't have any sense. You don't see everybody talking about it in the media? You don't want me to stop listening to you? Have you ever experienced that? Customs don't go into your package, suitcase, barrel or cargo unless you ship the item or the agent stand up right there when they inspect inspect it. Listen, customs job is to protect the borders, collect revenue, and to facilitate trade. Them not collect or store shipment, them inspect it. And somebody off-represent it for inspection.
