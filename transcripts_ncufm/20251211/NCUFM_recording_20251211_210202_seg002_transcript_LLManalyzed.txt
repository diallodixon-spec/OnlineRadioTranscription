2025-12-12 13:56:33 My failures implode Lord you've seen them all and you still call me friend Cause the God of the mountain Is the God of the valley And there's not a place your mercy and grace won't find me again. Oh, there's nothing better than you. There's nothing better than You, Lord. There's nothing, nothing is better than You. You turn morning to dancing. You give me strength.
