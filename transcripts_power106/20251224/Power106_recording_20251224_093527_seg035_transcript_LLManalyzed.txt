20251224 093527 left behind, some contracted two years, some still not completed. As you speak, I have an agent entity right now that their contract from 22 to 25 has not yet been completed. So we continue to be inefficient, but the people responsible for those programs still getting a pass mark in their appraisal. So there are cases as right now where workers are behind. You're going into January now. Tamarind season negotiations don't start at most of the places that we have to deal with. Public bodies have started, but they have signed a limp, limped off to a start. So when workers are one year behind on their contract, it poses a problem for them. And we like this retroactive thing, and we're going to have to get out of that because it don't help us. We need to start the negotiations early and get those things out of the way.
