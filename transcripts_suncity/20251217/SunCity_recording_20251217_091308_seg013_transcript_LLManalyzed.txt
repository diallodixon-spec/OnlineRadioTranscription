20251217 091308 is hard, I know that. And I've also been through my share of hardship. But, you know, as I keep trying to remind myself, you know, the roads to the greatest views are never paved with gold. They're always rough. And in the midst of the rough rough sometimes you might feel overwhelmed, saddened by it but what's on the other side is most times if not worth it. So I think keep loving yourself and others. Keep feeling both the inner fight and the outer fight. but we keep fighting and we never give up and we stand tall and you know stay encouraged stay uplifted and keep your heart light as feather and keep your soul firm as bone
