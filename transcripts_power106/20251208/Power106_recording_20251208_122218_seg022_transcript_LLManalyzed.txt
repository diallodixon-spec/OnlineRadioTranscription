Now the news. The Ministry of Finance and the Public Service has approved the removal of general consumption tax, GCT, on agricultural seeds for the next three months. Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Mining, Floyd Green, says this initiative is part of a comprehensive suite of recovery interventions to help farmers rebound from the extensive agricultural losses caused by Hurricane Melissa. He adds that the temporary waiver covers almost the entire vegetable seed line, allowing farmers to be provided planted material free. So if you have your nurseries we have already through RADA gone to Models and taken everything that Models have because we have a ramp up production now.
