You don't have a culture of education, you don't have culture of arithmetic, you don't culture of logic, and those are the things that are pillars of the investment economy and that is what you're trying to operate. You say you want to build STEM, you want to build all kinds of technology schools, and the people, the math scores are less than 50%. How are you going to build STEM with that? Exactly. No foundation. How? There is no foundation. Your primary school math and English scores are so poor, and you're then telling me that you're trying to build STEM. Do you even know how STEM works? So that's not how it works, brother. We have to start at the foundation, the base. Know the type of incredible you have. Know your house. And then you build upon that. Yeah, man. Yeah, exactly. Build the proper foundation. Foundation is important. Yeah, extremely. Just like we know in building. All right. Thank you. Great contribution.
