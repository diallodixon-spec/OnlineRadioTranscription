20251217 191915 I said we keeping it real I'm telling you like it is, baby I'll be there for you with anything you're facing I'll be your sunlight when it's raining Stay together and we go in places, yeah, yeah I'll be by your side no matter the case We have a one way ticket to greatness, greatness Girl, I don't want to lie Cause I believe in the truth And I just wanna live cool I don't want no dirty secrets fighting me and you We drive one car at a time But I still want to, but I still want to Now that we get to the truth, truth, truth I just live good. Look, the sun could shine the same time with the moon. Boy, I could only drive one car at a time. But I still want to, but I still want to.
