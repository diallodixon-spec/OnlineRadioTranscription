============================================================

Some things we're meant to be So why not let it be? And stop worrying about it As long as we know what's in our hearts We know what we're in our thoughts We don't know. Love is not a sin. Why do you worry what the people say? When they see me with you, they wonder what the problems say. When they find us together, they wonder what love is to say. And they know we're in love.
