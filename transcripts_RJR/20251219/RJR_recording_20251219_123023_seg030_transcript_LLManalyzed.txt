20251219 123023 Tracy? Hey, girl, what's up? So, hold on. Why you look so vexed this early? They're not just that. Lisa, it is so good to see you. But sorry you catch me like this, girl. My uncle said when I'm bailing, when my family go for clarity, you don't want to hear the cries of the people they put on or something. Make matters worse, me hear say half of the thing they're missing, and me know say a custom. Girl, how you know see a customs? Lisa, stop going like you don't have any sense. You don't see everybody talk about it in the media? You don't want me to stop listening to you? Have you ever experienced that? Customs don't go into your package, suitcase, barrel or cargo unless you ship the item or the agent stand up right there when they inspect it. Listen, customs job is to protect the borders, collect revenue and to facilitate trade. Them not collect or store shipment, them inspect it and somebody off represent it for inspection.
