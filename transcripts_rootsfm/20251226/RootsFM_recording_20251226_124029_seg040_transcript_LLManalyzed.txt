20251226 124029 Nobody needs too much love anymore. It's as high as a mountain and harder to climb. You and me, girl, got a highway to the sky. We can turn away from the night and day and the tears we had to cry You're the love I can see in you tonight Everything we all have ever done Love is such a beautiful thing When you want to leave a line about never all to see Our precious love, nobody gets too much hate
