20251215 181411 I can't get consent from her momma nor daddy But I sing glory, glory hallelujah Got to give thanks and praises to the father A long time I've been watching this little daughter She loves me now, whoa, she loves me now She loves me now Oh, she loves me now Off on the top with the deacon and the elder Expressing my love for Malvina You might talk about me if you come back tomorrow Gotta settle down and get married What's it they know? Said the wula then sorry She loves me now, oh She loves me now, whoa, she loves me now. She loves me now. Whoa, she love me now. She love me now.
