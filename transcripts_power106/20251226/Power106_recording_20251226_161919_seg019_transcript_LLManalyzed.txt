20251226 161919 You'll be doing fine once the music starts Oh, feel the beat of the rhythm of the night Dance until the morning light Forget about the worries on your mind You can lean them all behind Feel A celebration's starting Under the streetlights The scene is being set A night for romance A night you won't forget So come join the fun This ain't no time to be staying home Ooh, there's too much going on Tonight is gonna be a night like you've never known We're gonna have a good time tonight
