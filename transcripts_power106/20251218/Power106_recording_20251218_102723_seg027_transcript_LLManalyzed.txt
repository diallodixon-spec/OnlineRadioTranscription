20251218 102723 It's one data point, and of course you mentioned the shutdown impacted even October 2nd. So it's a month-over-month report. So it's one place to really look to see if this will continue. But from a map standpoint, it's a positive, because the map is now seeing the trend having enough room to cut the rate in 2026 and also bring forward the rate cut as well right and it's also positive because of course the consumers on the ground they have been complaining about prices and you know the case in economy where people on the ground are feeling it harder than those at the top so from a a consumer standpoint, and a market standpoint, that's not positive. And of course, it gives the Fed the opportunity to support, which means that markets could benefit going into 2026 from this. Yeah, but hold on.
