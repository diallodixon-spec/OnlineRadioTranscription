20251229 150306 It's weekend, you understand? It's become only our sense. It's weekend. You understand? It's Saturday. You understand? Thunder will rule. I don't know about you but I come here to fight Come to play a mask I'm not leaving until I wet Come to play a mass I don't live my life with regrets No, I come to jam on a bumper Come to drink on a liquor Until my head gone and And I'm miserable All the money grown I'm causing trouble Look how the security watch me They don't know I'm out there I just mushed up in place And I defect like a zombie And don't wait They don't want me in their party now
