20251225 161517 Yesterday you walked away With no thought of today Thinking you could go on Not remembering where you're from But it's too late now All the doors are closed You just don't know how the love story flows I hate you for everything you've done Now you're coming back It seems like you're running out of stuff Baby, I hate youdest day of my life
