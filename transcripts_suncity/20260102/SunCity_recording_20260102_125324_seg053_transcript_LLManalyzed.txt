20260102 125324 I'm going to add a little bit of color to my hair. I'm going to use a little bit of red to make my eyes, weakness. I got me addicted when you're switching positions. You tell me shit on a Friday. It's me dancing, I hear it, wishing that I did it. I can't keep sitting and pretending. Ooh, I'm taking up it all. Pretending's OK, DJ.
