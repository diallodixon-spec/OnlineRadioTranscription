So many times I wanted to just pick up the phone And tell you, ooh, baby, baby, I miss your lovin me what I'm missing Like I never left, yeah I had enough, I miss you bad What I did leave in the past Guess your girl is coming back I never let go Said back in the building, back on the block You and me together, we back on top Kind of love we got, it just don't stop I never let go I had enough, I miss you bad
