The problem is that Kamal is very, his boxing IQ is very, very high and he has crushing power and crushing accuracy that a lot of fighters don't want to face, which the Jamaican fans have seen many times back with the Rey and Nephew fight night contenders and stuff when he really can punch. Very good indeed. I think things will work out very well for him, no question about that. I see here Terence Bob Crawford, one of the greatest in the modern era, has announced his retirement at age 38. Was this expected, Tyler? You know what, he made a lot of money this year. I think it's a guy that kind of took the hard road and didn't make a lot of big, big money his whole career to actually make it now at 38.
