20251219 184225 Martial. I'm punching that's automatic I have a lightning jumbie A kind of energy inside me And it ready for the rum Ready, ready for the rum, ready, ready for rum Ready for the action A spiritual encounter Killing me soul taking over Telling me to start up the drinking And do away with good behaviour So we out on the road now It's Mars and Riddy Man Soaker And they're ready for the rum, ready, ready for the rum. Ready, ready, for the rum ready for the action. Boom! This sweating spirit of me feeling good.
