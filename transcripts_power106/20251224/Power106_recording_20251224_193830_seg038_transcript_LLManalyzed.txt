20251224 193830 Not bad. She is expected to improve on that, come from the camp of Anthony Dixon, and is expected to run well enough to win it. You are my sweet, you know. Here is having a very regular campaign, run on the 23rd of November, back on the 14th of December, then again on the 21st of December, lost by three parts of her length. I think that gives her top rating here. She will carry 126 pounds, so she's given away weight all around, and that could mediate against her, but she's so fit. And she has strong looking type as well, not big, just medium size, but pretty strong and well-bred by her own identity under the Kusha and Tran-Mare mom rules. So I think that she would be using her experience to get the better of number three, last possession. Is there a threat to both? Yes, there is. Force number two, fiddy number two, bad, bad Tanisha, right?
