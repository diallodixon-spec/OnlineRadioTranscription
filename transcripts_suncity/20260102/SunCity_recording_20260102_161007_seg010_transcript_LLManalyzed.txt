I said, because I never have nothing else but the father and my family at that time. So when I come out of the hospital, I draw from my laptop and set up my little studio and take my little time and do it, because my meditation never really did it. I slow, because I think I move fast, but I move slow. And I couldn't even pen this song, this song just come in on my head and I say, Father God you take me to trauma, you see how my life dem a wish offa, an anas came in and drugs me a live offa, a just a good way me do, dat a me karma. You see me a say and the words dem just a flow and me a say yo a prayer bring me
