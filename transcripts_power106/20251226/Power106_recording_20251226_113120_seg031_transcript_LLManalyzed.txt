20251226 113120 We have tomorrow But we had yesterday Wasn't it me who said that nothing good's gonna last forever And wasn't me who said let's just be glad for the time together. It must have been hard to tell me that you've given all you had to give. I can understand your feeling that way. Everybody's got their life to live. Well, I can't say goodbye in the cold morning light. But I can't watch love die in the warmth of the night. If I've got to be strong, don't you worry.
