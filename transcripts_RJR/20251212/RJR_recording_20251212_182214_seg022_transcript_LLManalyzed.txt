20251212 182214 great help to the team I have a great body structure that Bob Slayer needs so I just went and tried it and it's working now I mean we created history my first season in a couple months well so yeah Nimroy talk to me about your part of the two-man team that won the bronze medal last month. Yes, I am. I'm a leader of the team and the longest serving member of the team. Yeah, because you have been part of the program since 2017, I think. Yes, since 2017. It brings me joy to see that all of the hard work that we have put in is finally paying off. And at the current moment, we have a really good squad, and we're just sticking together, believing in ourselves, and pushing forward.
