20251216 212312 I'm taking what you said I know I don't. You give it to me like I earned it, baby. Girl, you pop out and make up nervous. It's giving they care with you when you know it. So bad ain't nobody gonna try you. Don't play with you in nice shoes. If you had a twin, I would choose you. Right hand on the Bible, girl, it's true. I hang up my jersey for you. Man down on my salute. I might just game for you. Girl, I'm saving.
