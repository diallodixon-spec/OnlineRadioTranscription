20251225 145827 What's bitter and twice shy? I keep my distance, but you still catch my eye Tell me, baby, do you recognize me? Well, if it's been a year, it doesn't surprise me Happy Christmas! I wrapped it up and sent it with a note saying I love you. I meant it. Now I know what a fool I've been. But if you kiss me now, I know you'd fool me again. Last Christmas, I gave you my heart. But the very next day you gave it away This year to save me from tears I'll give it to someone special Last Christmas
