20251224 210202 London. London. I'm feeling vibes on vibes. I'm a freaking dynamite. A flow you can't do light You know I'm just that type No, them nothing kill my vibe Them nothing kill my vibe them nothing kill Them nothing kill them nothing kill my wise man said Follow the stars There you shall find a piece of advice If you hit your enemies, shine. If you're not a friend of me, enter the light. Cause you can never kill my vibes. Quake with no sacrifices. Everything was taken, still had to make it. Vibe killer, me and you go take it. Vibe Killer, somebody's got to protect my head.
