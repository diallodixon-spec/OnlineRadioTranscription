20260101 160505 No feelings Just fuck it up like you mean it All eyes on you In the middle of the dance When you get in the mood You make it jiggle and bounce All eyes on you When you kick off your shoes You make it wiggle and bounce Say she want a rude boy with a rude boy wine Don't want no man there with no schoolboy wine No mannequin, no romancing She wanna go from night till the morning She fling it up, she fling it back I ride it, I go handle that She keep it up, she look back and I ride it Die when she lies, die when she lies She want some action in she lies Come Buddha just don't come at you Die when she dies Die when she lies Die when she lies She want the roughness in she lies And when I put down the work Watch out she face light up Boy, no sweet day
