20251224 090306 Deal with them in a style When stars align Greatness outshines all hatred in space and time So still we rise With grace and with faith in the morning with chains and iron They go out to put the job job on a payroll All fresh like you they roll Put some respect on me name I don't want to hear Don't give me that you want to pay. You want to pay, put some respect on the name. I don't want you to give me that you are to pay. You are to pay. For them, they can test the job. We demand this thing in our festival. Yeah, yeah. You can't miss the flag. High performance.
