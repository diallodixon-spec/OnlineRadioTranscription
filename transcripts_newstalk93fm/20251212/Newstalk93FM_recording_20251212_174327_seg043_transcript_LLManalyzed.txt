20251212 174327 It's like I love you is out of style a trending film and a kill woman and child When did the world get so unkind? So we did stay from the beginning of life Man, I get sacrificed for them family move up in the light. When they talk to you till they get crucified you off your head. Bitch a perfect living a lie. Try to know it's so sad. Nobody not believe in a love again. Because every love that lost. Nobody not believe, in a friend again. I'll be a stab in the back and back to wrong. Nobody not liar. And it hurts my heart, still a heart for one and one for all Still I believe that love is everlasting How it gets so normal, how we so comfortable
