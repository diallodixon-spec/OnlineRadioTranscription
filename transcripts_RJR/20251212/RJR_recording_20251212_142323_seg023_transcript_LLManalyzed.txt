2025-12-12 15:47:20 I don't believe in like royalty Never ever happy thing twice no way Never ever happy think twice no way Me used to sleep on stag a coach we used to sleep on Cory coach them and they never let me out We used to live a Eddie house. They never keep me on a key. She came I used to let me out We bring him with me go LA. It's like a him get nominated. He watched the grammy side of me How much people can you say? Would feed you when you're hungry, when you brought them, bless you with money But I have been so fortunate Surrounded by so many people, make sure I say me gone pathetic And them the thing me can't forget Your daughter and me daughter, once me leaving, she no happy freak
