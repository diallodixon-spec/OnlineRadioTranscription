I once was lost in sin but Jesus took me in and then a little light from heaven filled my soul it paid my heart in love and wrote my name above, And just a little talk with Jesus made me whole. Now let's have a little with Jesus, Let's tell him all about our trouble, He will hear our faintest cry, And answer by and by, When you feel ill prayer will turn in your favor.
