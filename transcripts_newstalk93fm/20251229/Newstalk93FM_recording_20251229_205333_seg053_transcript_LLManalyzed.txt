Burn all the bridges. Don't ask for forgiveness. Walk away like I'm someone you hate. Don't let me down easy. If you're gonna leave me, baby, go and leave me all the way. When I found you, you were young. We were lost in the cold. Pulled up to you in the jag, turned your axe into gold. The winding road leads to the chateau, you remind me
