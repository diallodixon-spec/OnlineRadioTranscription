2025-12-11 21:58:16 I'm just showin' my potential Doin' what I do best Exterminatin' the plagues and pests Go call a taxi for me Get it done, trouble is emergency Break with the light, the speed limit's gone I forgot the station on the island boy Island boy, island boy They used to teach either gold and wool That means a man with no gold will rule My granny would say, oh dear The game will repeat if you don't play fair Call a taxi for for me. Get on the double, I want it quickly. Brake, brake, light the speed limits. Come on, have a god position on it. Island boy, island boy.
