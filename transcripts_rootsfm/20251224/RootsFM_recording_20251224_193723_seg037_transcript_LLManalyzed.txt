Tonight you know, it's a-chilling We finally play, the ice come away Walking in the winter wonderland Sleigh bells ring, are you listening? In the land, snow is glistening. A beautiful sight, where every good night. Walking in the winter Wonderland. In the meadow we can build a snowman. Can't pretend that easy circus come. We'll have a lot of fun with the snowman. Until other kids not come down Going away is a bluebird In the state is a new bird Sing the song as we go along Walking away to wonderland
