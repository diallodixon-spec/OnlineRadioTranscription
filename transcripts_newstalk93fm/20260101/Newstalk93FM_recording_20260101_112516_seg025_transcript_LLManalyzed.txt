20260101 112516 I could return to sender Your tight tosses and turn me there ain't no splendor Now I'm riding this wave with you All my girlfriends they disapprove but you are You're my piece of mind, mind, mind Oh all mine But they criticize so nice so nice so nice never catch a vibe that feels so right When you're not around I close my eyes and bend to the sun Loving sweet, so sweet, so sweet Every time you pass me skin it heat Me and the melody and him and the beat That's how we do it
