============================================================

We'll find it hard to sleep tonight. They know that Santa's on his way. He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh. And every mother's child is gonna spy To see if reindeer really know how to fly And so I'm offering this simple phrase To kids from one to 92. Although it's been said many times, many ways, Merry Christmas to you.
