20251225 214527 This December we'll be All together a family This Christmas let's get around It's a sunny celebration It feels so good we all at home There will be no separation Stalking by the fireplace Roast a cup of marshmallow while the fireplace Presents open early in the morning Thankful for the gifts of twarming There's nothing sweet like home Better than the FaceTime and the telephone No matter how far I roam Won't be spending Christmas all alone
