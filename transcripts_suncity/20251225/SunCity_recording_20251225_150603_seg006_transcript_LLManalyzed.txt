20251225 150603 So all I ask of you is please stand tall. Stand tall. Remember me tell you, don't run before you can walk. As a friend and company, you have to watch them, you know. Show me a friend and I'll tell you who you are. Please be careful and don't make me cry. I don't want to hold a melody or wipe the tears from my eyes.
