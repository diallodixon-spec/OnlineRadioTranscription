20251212 154938 It's gone. It's the he's past his prime but he is king and I'm telling you that if he enters this clash, you know, there's nothing to be gained from coming in this clash. My G just just watch them. Just watch them do them thing. This is Massica's time. It's it's the handing over the guard Kareem. It's the hand over the guard. Massica link up. Yeah. Link up. Your views on Tommy Lee's evil rise versus Massica's death row. Oh my gosh. Talk to me guys. I mean these two songs, Death Row was released literally right after System. And for me, and I've said it and I expected it, Massacre is a very smart man. Every time he releases something, it's getting better and better and better. I was up until 1.30 because after Massacre Drop System, Tommy posted in IM story and said 11.30 I was going to go to my bed and then Tommy said 11.30 and I said wait till 11.30 then we couldn't go sleep but what the streets are said right now
