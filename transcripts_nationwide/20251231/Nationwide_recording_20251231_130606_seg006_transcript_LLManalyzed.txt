20251231 130606 I need somebody to hear, somebody to know Somebody to have, somebody to hold It's easy to to say But it's never the same I guess I kinda like the way you knowned all the pain And all the day bleeds into nightfall And you're not here to get me through it all I let my guard down, and then you pulled the rug I wish that kinda used to being someone you loved I'm going under in this time I fear there's no one to turn to This all or nothing way of loving go be sleepy
