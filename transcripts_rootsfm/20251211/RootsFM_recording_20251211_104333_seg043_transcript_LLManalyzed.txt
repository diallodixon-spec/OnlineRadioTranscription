============================================================

You should reach there about 11. 11, we'll be there. We'll stay two or three hours. And head back in. By one o'clock, we are on our way back. Little did we know. The drive to Montego Bay itself was long and excruciating. Everybody was moving west. Everybody was heading there. So the two hours that we were expecting to reach, we didn't even reach half of the journey. We were still on the road. And there are trees on the road. There are poles on the road. Until we reached Montego Bay town around 2 p.m. And then we reached a point where we couldn't drive any further. There were trees on the road. The road was bad. And as we are reaching that point, the military are starting to clear the road. So we are there thinking it's about nine miles left.
