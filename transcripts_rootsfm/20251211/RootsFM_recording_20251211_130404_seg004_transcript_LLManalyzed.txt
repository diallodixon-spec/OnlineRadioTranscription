============================================================

So control me. That I will rule. Yes, I will rule my destiny. Will rule my destiny. Rule my destiny. That God will rule, yes, I will rule, my destiny. Teach me thy way, O Jah. I will always walk in thy truth. Give me a part to praise thee, and to fill thy name. Blessed are the merciful, for they shall love thee. Consider my affliction, so much, Sango. With the big song, Innocent, once again for the month of December. A big tune.
