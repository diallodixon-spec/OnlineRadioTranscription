20260101 165743 or New Year's Eve as we call it often while holding hands in a circle so let me paint a picture everyone stands in a circle holding hands then at the beginning of the final verse and there's a hand my trusty friend they cross their arms across their bodies so that their left hand is holding the hand of the person on the right and their right hand holds that of the person on their left when the the song ends, everyone rushes to the middle, still holding hands, and probably giggling. As the British then emigrated across the world, they took the song and the New Year tradition with them, and somehow that message travelled far beyond the shores of Scotland, crossing oceans, cultures, and centuries, until it became the song that the world turns to at the exact moment one year ends and another begins. Each time it's played, it invites us to pause, to reflect and to carry those memories with us as we move forward.
