20251226 141210 So much fun and action we miss. Longing to shake it up. Time to make it up. Come on, enjoy yourself. Hey, hey, hey. When last you went to party and the music gripped you. Oh, oh, long time. When last you in a party And the heights trip you, oh oh Long time We go jump, jump all night long Mash up the party, crash the party Rock the party When last you spent your morning. Oh, oh, last time. Hey, hey.
