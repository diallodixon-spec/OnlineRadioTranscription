Look at me now, look at me now Look at me now I thank God for my blessing Now I can put it back to some of the same people They were used to setting, God who used to set him Now I bust him, can't bust him, see him when I take bust Come on, stay tropical, I love them, but I still like all of them Bust them, but I can't trust them, see them, but I not touch them I hate them, but I cannot love them From Trench Town, Onyx, Star love them Look at me now where they treat me less than good Put me in a box like a rectangle Look at me now, look at me now Look at me now and I tell you my life Where they used to go, I go, no one used to come out My my life was so lonely. Look at me now, look at me now. When they try everything, yeah. But see me now, see me now. When the world never works, when the world never works.
