20251231 155330 Back in the days I used to dream of being rich Have a lot of houses and cars, couldn't know which one was which And finally a chicken getting hitch Living a fairytale life, perfect without a ditch You think that this should bring me happiness? If at the end of every rainbow there was a treasure chest Sometimes having more is really less So take a look inside yourself, you'll realize you're really blessed No matter how you're sad and blue There's always someone who has it worse than you Sometimes you got a plan you do So don't worry, just push on through Even in the crowd I pick up all my people who be working on the future Don't know they got a struggle Even in the crowd So all my people's working on the night of fire And doing right to keep themself up out of trouble Even in the crowd It's getting so lonely inside this bed. To know if I should lick my wounds and say oh, it's me instead. There's a naked inside my head.
