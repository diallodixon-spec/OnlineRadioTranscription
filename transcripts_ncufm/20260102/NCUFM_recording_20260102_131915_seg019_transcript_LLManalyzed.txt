20260102 131915 going to church singing all about how much you're worth and then continue doing my dirt living as if I didn't care if you're hurt cuz if it's God that I'm after I just can't serve two masters and before something happens I gotta turn it all around because I know I can't just have my cake and eat it too Cause it's really easy to stay on the fence and still do you It'd be cool if we could love the Lord and still go through our thing But see it doesn't work like that You gotta be white or black Lord, I really need you
