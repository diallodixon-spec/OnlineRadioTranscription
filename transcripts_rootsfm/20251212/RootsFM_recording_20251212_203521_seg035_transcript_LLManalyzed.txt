20251212 203521 I've got tears in my eyes. I feel just like yesterday when little kids come out to play. You exist, it shouldn't go to waste. Touch me the same, don't count away. Melt my heart on the spot. You don't really have to say no more. I know what I've got. Can I have another date with you? And will you spend the whole night true? I'm so happy I've got tears in my eyes.
