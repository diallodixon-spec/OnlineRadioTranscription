resourced independently of IPEB. So maybe we can get some clarity on that. So hopefully we can get some word from the Ministry of Labour and Social Security. What's important, however, is we give away, it comes to be given out as quickly and as fairly as possible. All right? And because we do have people to feed, to house and so on. I'm very concerned with the housing part of it as well. It's a long time now. I mean, yes, we have to be short in terms of the scale of the hurricane, but in terms of exposure, that has to be dealt with, you know, right? And that has to deal with some amount with alacrity. So, we'd love to hear more about that while they await the supply of houses coming, what, in January, they said, or they're about to speak about that, and procurement being a factor, which is why, respectively, say, at least January, or what happens in the interim, or what has happened in the interim.
