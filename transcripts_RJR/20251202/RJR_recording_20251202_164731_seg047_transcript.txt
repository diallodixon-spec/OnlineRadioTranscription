I'm on a romantic call Talking to my baby over the year It's all about your love All about your love it's all about your love like all about your love feeling like we're just feeling fine for just Spend my life with you, I'd die for us, fight for us Spend my life for you Young king of pretender Something to remember She hunting for a spender The world freeze when you enter You're pretty like Dalek and you're pleased at the center
