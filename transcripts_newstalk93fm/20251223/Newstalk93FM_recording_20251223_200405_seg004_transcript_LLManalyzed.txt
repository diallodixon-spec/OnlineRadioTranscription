20251223 200405 I don't want no dirty secrets fighting me and you Boy, I could only drive one car at a time But I still want to, but I still want to And let me get to the truth, truth, truth I just wanna live good, good, good Look, the sun could shine the same time with the moon Jesus! I know it might hot up your head now. I hope I didn't set up myself. Love comes from a place where we don't get jealous. And we don't live like no dream sellers. I say we keeping it real. I'm telling you like it is, baby. I'll be there for you with anything you're facing. I'll be your sunlight when it's raining. Stay together and we go in place.
