And we're just getting started. Cause this, this is our spot. Our love is like summer time. Healing my mind, our love is Like summer time. Ooh, feels so cool to me. This is a fact. Fireflies lighting our way as we walk walk Words floating in the summer breeze when we talk What we have is endless Take away all my stress It's so familiar and still so brand new
