And this message is from Ibar in Barbados. Good afternoon to our listeners in Barbados. Hope you're having a good time this afternoon. And we thank you so much for making it Power 106 FM. As we send lots of love to our listeners, in Barbados. Ibar says good evening to you Jesse. It's always nice listening to you. I was listening to the guy that was speaking to you about the sugar factories because I used to be a sugar boiler for 17 years in Barbados. It was my first job after leaving school. I learned it from my father and the boss because the three of us worked on the same shift from Ibar in Barbados. Isn't that something? I wonder what sugar production is like in Barbados. Thank you for your message.
