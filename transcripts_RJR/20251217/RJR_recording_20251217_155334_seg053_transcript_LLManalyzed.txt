20251217 155334 or if it's like a thing, but it's a rule that I always have in my head that you look at debt as, is it a productive debt? Is it productive debt or is it debt that consumes your growth or your progress? So productive debt would be, for example, you're taking out a loan to invest in your business that already has real cash flow and you need to inject capital to give it, to have more cash flow. Exactly. Or for the debt that is more, that consumes a little bit more, it'd be like a credit card that you take out and you go down, I don't call no name or no store, but you go down there and you swipe, swipe, swipe and come back with one bag of shoes, one bag of this, your belly. Hey, some people have some name brand gut, do you see? You ever tell them, go down to a restaurant and they swipe, swipe. But that's the kind of debt that you're looking at. You have to look at if the debt is going to help you progress. Yeah. With your goals or is it going to set you back? That's really it. It's important. Somebody say good afternoon. Good afternoon.
