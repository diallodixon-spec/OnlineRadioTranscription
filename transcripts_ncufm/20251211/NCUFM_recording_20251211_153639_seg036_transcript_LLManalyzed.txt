I love cabbage in all its forms. My grandson loves curry steamed cabbage. Curry steamed cabbage? I've never tried that one before. Wow. Curry steamed cabbage. Curry's all right. I prefer my cabbage in my salads. I prefer my academics in red, white, and green. I think the colours are nice and it looks good. It's so nice in it. I like to juice it with carrot. I like to eat it with fruit. I like cherry, is that? Thank you.
