Taking over us Something is going on It must be love Taking over us Tonight could be the night The vibe is nice and the mood is right There's something about this moment That just makes us smile And as I look into your eyes I can see that you're not surprised We both know we've got faith in each other And it's been there for a while I always look forward to this time of year To do what we all should do Spread the cheer, see happiness all around
