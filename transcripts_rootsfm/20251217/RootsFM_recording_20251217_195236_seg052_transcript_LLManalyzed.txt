20251217 195236 How will I know Don't trust your feelings How will I know How will I know You'll be deceiving How will I know? How will I know if he really loves me? I say a prayer with every heartbeat I fall in love whenever we meet I'm asking you, but you know about these things How will I know if he is thinking of me? I try to fall but I'm too shy Can't speak Falling in love is a bit of speed This love is strong but I can't wait Oh, wake me I'm shaking Wish I had you near me now Said there's no mistaking What I feel is really love
