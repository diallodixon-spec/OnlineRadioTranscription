20251216 172520 last month was 666,000 vehicles getting shipped around the world. If China keeps going at that rate, it will be exporting 8 million vehicles a year, which is twice as many vehicles as Germany makes. And all those Chinese exports are taking market share away from legacy automakers, but no one is getting hit harder than the Japanese. They used to control about 80 to 90 percent of the Southeast Asian market, but that's evaporating quickly. In Thailand, for example, Japanese market share has dropped from 90 percent to 71 percent, and BYD now outsells Honda there. In fact, BYD is taking the fight right to the Japanese home market with it's own K-Car. It's going to launch an electric K-Car next year called the Racco that will boast a base price just a little over 16,000 bucks. K-Cars, which account for about 40 percent of the Japanese market, are smaller cars.
