20251222 200103 You're listening to Sleek Radio, 93 FM. I love the way that you bring a vibe With your hands them up in the sky Rollin' back and havin' a dime We ain't like men again And we haven't money to spend Yes, we jammin' down to the end See me with me cannibal friend When you come in, my baby, I wish you come from there.
