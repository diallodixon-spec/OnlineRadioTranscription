I'm not leaving, that's impossible to do Cause if you want me to I'm not leaving that's impossible to go Cause if you want to go You gotta be looking the way you do You gotta be cooking the way you do, you gotta be looking at me If you want me to go You gotta look the way you do You gotta be walking the way you do Because you're looking me Come on! I don't know what to do so I'm bleeding Bless you, I give me no reason You tell me this is the end of the season Mash everything, dress yourself But you go all out when you out your place to come inside Baby don't do me that you go crazy
