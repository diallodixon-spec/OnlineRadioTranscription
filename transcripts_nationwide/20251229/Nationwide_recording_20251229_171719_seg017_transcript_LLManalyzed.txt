It's widely considered by supporters of Garvey that he was convicted after being targeted by then Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigations, FBI, J. Edgar Hoover, and deprived of a fair trial. Garvey's sentence was later commuted by President Calvin Coolidge on the recommendation of the U.S. Attorney General. Upon his release in November 1927, Garvey was deported via New Orleans to Jamaica. This despite millions of signatures petitioning for his full pardon. Nine of the 12 jurors who had convicted him also signed the petition. Over the years, several requests have been made for Garvey to be pardoned by the US governmentS. government. Former Prime Minister Edward Seaga made a request to former U.S. President Ronald Reagan when he visited Jamaica in 1982. That bid failed. The U.S. Congressional campaign to clear Garvey's name was launched in 1987.
