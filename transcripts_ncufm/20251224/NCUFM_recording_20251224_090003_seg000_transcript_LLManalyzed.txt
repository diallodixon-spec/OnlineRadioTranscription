20251224 090003 Thank you to the new sports and production team and special thanks to producer Tamari Allen and Shanessa Hall. God bless you, First Lighters! We do do this all over again tomorrow from 6 till 9. Things might be a little bit different but I am going to be here to keep you company. So until we meet again and may the peace of the Lord God surround you. May His light direct your path. May His Spirit lead and guide you as the weeks and months go past.
