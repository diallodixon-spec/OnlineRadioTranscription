20251226 123124 The heart's made full from the manger to the throne Every step we take today Reminds us we're not alone Hope is humming in the air Mercy falling like the rain From the wounds you turn to wonders You've rewritten every pain We lift our eyes, we lift our song For the love that found a way In the warmth of holy joy, we whisper Happy Boxing Day When the rapids turn away And the silence softly stays We remember why we're here Your love remains, it'll never fade Happy Boxing Day We're dancing in your light Heart's on Boxer's render Shining through the night Happy Boxing Day
