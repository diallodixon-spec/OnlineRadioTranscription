20251223 094533 Today's inspiration comes to us by the story titled Dirty Washing by Jonathan Kessenbaum. Now, a young couple moved into a new house. The next morning, while they were eating breakfast, the young woman looked out the window and saw her neighbour hanging laundry on the line. That laundry's not very clean, she said. She doesn't know how to wash correctly. Perhaps she needs better detergent. Her husband listened quietly, saying nothing. Day after day, whenever the neighbor hung her washing out to dry, the young woman repeated the same comments. Her laundry is still dirty. Doesn't she know how to wash properly? Then one morning, about a month later, the woman looked out and was surprised. The laundry was spotless, bright and clean. She exclaimed, Look! She's finally learned how to wash correctly. I wonder who taught her this?
