20251218 131508 I'm gonna gather, gather up my feelings And lock them all inside So when you say you're leaving And you walk out my door I can't help but let and say to myself You can't hurt me anymore When I know I should be crying And I'm slowly dying Cause the whole world has gone From tear to heart to soul And it's all in your tears baby Jesus, Jesus, Jesus. Jesus, Jesus.
