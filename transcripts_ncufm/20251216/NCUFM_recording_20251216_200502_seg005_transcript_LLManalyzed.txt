I love the Lord with all my heart today and I continue to thank him every day for my wife and my children because God has made my life new. I don't have to do crack anymore. I don't to run the streets anymore. I got enough beauty in my home that I don't have seek beauty anywhere else because God is in my home and God is my children and God is in my wife. I thank God for what he's done in my life. You're here today and you might have somebody that's hooked on a drug or something. Don't stop praying because God answers prayer. He answered the prayer of a hurting, crying wife. And he brought her husband back. He brought crying children crying children their father back but it was only when I surrendered and I was able to look at him for who he is it only took one look and I surrendered all took me away from sin
