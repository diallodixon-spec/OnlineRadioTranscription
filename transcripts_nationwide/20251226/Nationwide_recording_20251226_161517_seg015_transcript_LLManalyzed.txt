20251226 161517 I am strong, and I die First I believe, and leave my head I was wrong, now I'm fine Just one thing makes me forget Red, red, I'm at my feet so fine You keep me rocking all of the time Red red whining makes me feel so grand I feel a million dollar when you just hit me on Red red whining made me feel so sad
