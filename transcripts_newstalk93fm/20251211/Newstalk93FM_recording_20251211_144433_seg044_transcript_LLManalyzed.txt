============================================================

Let's know what we found. Something so wild will be ordinary. You got me kissing the ground for your sanctuary. Shatter me with your touch. Oh, Lord, return me to dust. The angels up in the clouds are jealous. Know what we found. Hopeless hallelujah. Hopeless side of heaven's gate. Oh, my, my, you're taking me out of the ordinary I want you laying me down till we're dead and buried On the edge of your knife, staying drunk on your vibe The angels up in the clouds are jealous now
