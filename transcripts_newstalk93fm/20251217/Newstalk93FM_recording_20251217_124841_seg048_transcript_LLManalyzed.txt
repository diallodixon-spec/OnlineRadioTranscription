20251217 124841 I want you laying me down to a dead and buried. On the edge of your night, staying drunk on your vibe. The angels up in the clouds are jealous knowing we found something so out of the ordinary. You got me kissing the crowd, crowd sanctuary. Try to meet what you're taught, or donek Radio, 93 FM. Finally, she loves, she loves me now. And I believe somehow, we're in a perfect place. Finally, she wants to come and stay.
