20251223 162820 What would I really become? What would life really be like if I never had no friends? Would I steal from me or someone else? Is it really just life I hear? How I feel like before everyone notices? Have I really got chosen? Whoa, am I really that potent? Is it really my pride that my tears gone dry one ever think with a nose, no one ever sink with a cross Don't hear even blink an' snooze I'm not so down when I get jinxed cause I'm up Drop a pair up on the knee and I'm no more for those The paper turned blue A pain to load me up A train to hurt me hard
