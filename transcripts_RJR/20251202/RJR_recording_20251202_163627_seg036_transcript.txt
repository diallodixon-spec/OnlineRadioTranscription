Don't be shy, baby, tell me what you want from me. Moments like these call it feel good, good. Drink, we are drinking all morning, morning. Ready now, you're dirty charging. Baby, make things semi-falling, falling, falling. You love what make me jump, jump, jump one again! DJ Khaled! You remind me of summer Shine some bright in my club, girl Why they meet till I wander? Pretty like the girls on the magazine cover Girl, you are the best of everybody, I love her Why Nelly, can we just do the dance?
