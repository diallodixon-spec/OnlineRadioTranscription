Sexually, people don't like to talk about this, you know, because people get embarrassed, but be patient. It takes time to recover. I think it's important that if you have a partner, that partner is involved, that they come to your doctor's visits as well so they can understand what is happening. Communication with the partner is very important. And just to remember, the sexual health or sexual dysfunction is a medical issue. It is not a personal failure. And also, as well, you'd have to have regular follow-ups with the doctor. Look to monitor how the prostate cancer is doing, so monitoring the PSA levels, that's the blood test that I had spoken about last week, and identify any symptoms that you might be having so we can address it early.
