drill all you want in Tobago you'll find limestone nice limestone and pretty beach and are people who are very calm and who don't like mix up with trinities sometimes why is Trinidad? what is she up to? I don't know and we need to find out from her I know there may be some people who don't believe me you know that in real geologically Trinidad is a part of Venezuela I think they may not believe it but you can go look in fact you can take you can take a kayak and just paddle across you can't take no kayak to go reach Tobago.
