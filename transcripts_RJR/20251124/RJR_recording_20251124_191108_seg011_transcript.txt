============================================================

Oh, knowing that I have to go. Well, they're putting up resistance, but I know that my faith will lead me on. I can't say what life will show me, but I know what I see. I can't see where life will show me But I know what I see I can't say where life will lead me But I know where I'll be Tried my hand at love and friendship But all that is passed and gone This little boy is moving on. Sitting here in the boat, waiting for the tide to flow.
