20251225 163726 They don't want me cause I do one way, they don't want me in their proscenium. I ain't gonna listen to nothing they say Every fast I jump, jumping up Doing what I want, jumping up Tell them I ain't leaving Right they are sleeping Every fast I jump Jumping up, doing what I want Jump going. Until my head gone and I'm miserable. All the money grown, I'm causing trouble. Look how deep security I watch me. They don't know I'm out there. I just mush up deep place and I deep set like a jumbo.
