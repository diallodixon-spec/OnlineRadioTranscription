Hey, hey,y, coffee flink, I'ma only pull up off it one. Make your turn up, turn up that tune, you're just in me. And the pretty girl, you run up, run up, run a bottle of fish again. So I'ma take up the mic and pull, and make a baby go and pass it. Watch up, now sing, and come sing out the way. When my sound plays, it produces lighters in the air. Your vibes up in the street. And that's just how it feels When reggae music plays Can't help but move your feet
