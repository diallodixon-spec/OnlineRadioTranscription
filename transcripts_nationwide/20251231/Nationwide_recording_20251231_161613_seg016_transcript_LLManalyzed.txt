Usually my exes turn to enemies But this is different Cause we didn't get closer now that you ain't with me Oh, they run at me, yeah But they ain't the way we gon' forget that In your family, love me like a family You know where to stand with me So when they ask, tell them you're the right one Long times, can't say We didn't try You've always been a real one Even though we ain't together It was real love, and maybe it's still love I hate that we ain't making it to forever Probably ain't getting but a vulture
