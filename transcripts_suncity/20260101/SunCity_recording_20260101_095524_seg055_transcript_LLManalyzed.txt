20260101 095524 The only one for me I feel you in my soul Your heart's caressing me So, do you love me? I'm under your control You're all I'll ever need You can use me Of all the times I've been alone The one has been as beautiful, so strong in understanding to me. In all the ways that I can see, no one has been less good for me. Hey, you will always be the one for me.
