Watcha! Reggae music where the people them dependent From now till the morning vibes they no go end Nothing derogative a strictly message I a send From your born in Jamaica there is no escaping it Reggae music on the top it's everybody's favorite Say you no go feel no pain Even when the bass a lick This is perfectly natural and no nothing satanic And if your born overseas You need to take a trip Like a pilgrimage to me cause a we created it you want to see some real woman why not them waste to it like a musical scientist or manipulate physics i said hey mr dj play that one again well it's a reggae music where the people them depend on from now till the morning
