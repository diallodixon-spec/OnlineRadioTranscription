20251217 202115 Took me a while, but I'm finally here So I just wanna testify, make it crystal clear See, I've been picked out, to be picked on Shocked about, out my friend's mouth I've been beat down, till you turn my life around Seems like I always fall short of being worthy Cause I ain't good enough, but he still loves me I ain't no superstar, the spotlight ain't shining on me No no no no Cause I ain't Good Enough, but he still love me I used to wake up some days and wish I stayed asleep Cause I went to bed on top of the world Today the world's on top of me Now everybody's got opinions
