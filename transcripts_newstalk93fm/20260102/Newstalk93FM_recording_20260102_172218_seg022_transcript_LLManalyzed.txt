20260102 172218 Hello. Hello. You can grab a drink, maybe grab some food, don't be shy. Call my mama, baby. I know it's hard, but no, I don't have the glass. I had to protect my heart. I built the wall so tall, I couldn't look over. I need to touch you. One more time, one more time. I'll take you one by five, not on the wireless. And though you said not to call you again when I miss you And I hope I can see you one more time when I miss you Baby, baby, baby, baby
