And I thank Mr. Damian Duckett, the Executive Director for Minimis Heritage Queen Competition. All right. Thank you so much, Brianna. It's been a great pleasure talking to you. My listeners, of course, now have a soft spot for St. Thomas. I'll be cheering you on. And Ms. Camille McNeil, Brianna's mother, thank you so much for being with us as well. And congratulations as well. I hope you all enjoyed it. Enjoy the competition and of course, come out on top. Thank you very much. Our pleasure to be here. Thanks for having us, Mrs. Jackson Miller. Take care. Mrs. Jackson Miller? Yes, ma'am. I want to say, and I really want to say it, that I had your name in one of my poems. Wow. I'm honored. Thank you. You're welcome. Bye. Bye-bye. You take care.
