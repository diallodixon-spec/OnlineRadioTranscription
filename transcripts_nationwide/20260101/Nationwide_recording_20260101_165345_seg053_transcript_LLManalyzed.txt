20260101 165345 Every night I hope and pray a dream lover will come my way a girl will hold in my arms and know the magic of her charms cause I want a girl to call my own I want a dream lover So I don't have to dream alone Dream lover, where are you With a love oh so true And the hand that I can hold To feel you near as I grow old cause I want a girl to call my own I want a dream lover so I don't have to dream alone
