20251223 151912 I just got off 311 to report it again. I said this guy is going to die. He's in the bus station and it's getting colder and colder. Yeah. Say it again please. No, I'm saying it's cold. It's cold, very cold. You can get down to freezing, below freezing at night. So I called again and I said, sometimes they'll get out there, the homeless people will get out there, but they don't want to go. They don't want to force them. I think they should. If you can't mentally think for yourself, I think they should take you. That's my opinion. After putting one of my family members into a mental institution, at one point, it was painful to do that, but that was the right decision I think I made think I made the right right right right right decision so some of these people need to get just just take them put them in a mental institution because they can't they can't cognizant nothing and it's really that real disease is not you know we said a madman in Jamaica
