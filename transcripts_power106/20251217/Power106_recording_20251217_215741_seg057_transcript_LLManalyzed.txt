20251217 215741 The sounds of Christmas Merry sounds that please the ear Sounds that come just once a year Telling us it's Christmas time again The sounds of Christmas Harness bells shake and ring Carolers are caroling sound of snow against the window pane. Snap and crackle of the Yuletide log. Popcorn poppin' in the grate. Neighbors knockin' at the old door.
