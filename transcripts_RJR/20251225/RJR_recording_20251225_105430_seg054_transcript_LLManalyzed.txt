20251225 105430 This is 94.5 FM. It was almost Christmas time There I stood in another line Trying to buy that last gift or two Not really in the Christmas mood Standing right in front of me Was a little boy waiting anxiously, pacing round like little boys do. And in his hands he held a pair of shoes, and his clothes were worn out.
