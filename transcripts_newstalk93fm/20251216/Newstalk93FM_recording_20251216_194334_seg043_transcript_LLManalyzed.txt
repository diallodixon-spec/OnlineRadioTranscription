20251216 194334 do you love me at night? head is spinning and they don't know when to stop she said forever babe, did you mean it at night? hold on, hold on leave me on read babe but i still get the message instead of lying, it's three dots but i can connect and if it ain't rape babe, you know i respect it We are now at the end of our drive. I think I'd rather you in my bed. Whatever it is, you know I can take it. Counting the days, how many days till I can see you again. Blowing kisses like will you catch up my night? I'm cute but with arrows babe, I'm just shooting my shot. If I could get in, drive me home.
