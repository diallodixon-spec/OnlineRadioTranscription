20251217 142719 Hey, guy. What's with the crew cut, huh? Didn't you hear the shepherd? Today's the day we get sheared. Sheared? Yeah. I can't get sheared? It's almost winter. I'll freeze. Besides, I hate stubby underarms. Oh, come on. Our shepherd's got a good shelter for us. Oh, I hate winter. It's always wet and cold, and I always get mud in between my hooves. Why are you worrying about winter? Oh, yeah, right. Why am I worried about winter? We're not going to live to see it anyway. Have you noticed how thin the grass is getting around here? We're probably going to run out of food. Will you stop worrying? You know every winter the shepherd takes us to the lower pasture where the grass is green and tall? Yeah, where the creek runs through and the grass grows up to our chest.
