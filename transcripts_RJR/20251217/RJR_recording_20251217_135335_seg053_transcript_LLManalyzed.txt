20251217 135335 The Lystra Primary and Infant School, over there in Somerset, St Thomas. Full joy to the fullest from Marvelyn, your husband Orville Wright, and the rest of your family. All right. Oh my gosh. You people, you see. I'm biased, you know. Some are in love with bad and some are biased against me. I don't have nothing more to say. Happy 31st wedding anniversary to my parents, Mr. and Mrs. Wright. Also, happy birthday to the following persons, my cousins, Ricardo Hardy and Calvin Edwards, aka Sheldon. Also, my friends, Ivan Duffus, aka Doreen, Lorraine Edwards and Shem Laws. They're all celebrating today coming from the original greetings girl, Melisha, aka Haridge. All right, this one is going out to Marcia Forbes. She is from Golden Valley in St. Thomas.
