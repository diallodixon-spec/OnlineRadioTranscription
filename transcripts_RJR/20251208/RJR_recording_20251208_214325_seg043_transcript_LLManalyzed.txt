============================================================

Oh, you make my world a summer day. I am just a dream to fade away. Nobody gives up too much, ever, no one. It's much harder to come back. I'm waiting in line. Nobody needs too much loving love. It's as high as a mountain and harder to climb. You and me, girl, got a highway to the sky. We can turn away from the night to day From the tears we've had to cry You're my love I can see you're new to me Everything we are we're better than that
