20251223 130407 But I can't ease the tension Too much affectin' woman They say I'm too out of control But there's too much action Somebody pour a nexon Until my head gone And I'm miserable All down on the ground I cause a trouble Look how the security watch me They don't know about me I just mash up in place And I defend like a jumbie I don't wait They don't want me in they proceeding They don't want because I do one way They don't want in they proceeding I ain't don't listen nothing to say Every time I jump Jumping up Doing what I want Jumping up Tell them are you leaving? Right they are sleeping Every time I jump, jumping up, doing what I want. Jumping up. Tell them, are you leaving? Right there, I'm sleeping. Every time I drop, jumping up. Doing what I want, jumping up, telling my you're leaving, right there I'm sleeping. Hey, they don't want me, no. They don't want me.
