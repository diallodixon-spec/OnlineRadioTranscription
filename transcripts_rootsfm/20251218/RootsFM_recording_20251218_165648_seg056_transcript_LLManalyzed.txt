20251218 165648 There is one question I'd really love to ask. One heart. Is there a place for the hopeless sinners who has hurt all mankind just to save his own beliefs? One love. One heart? Let's get together and feel alright. As it was in the beginning. One love. So shall it be in the end. One heart. Alright. With thanks and thanks to the lord. And I will. Feel alright. Let's get together and feel all right one more time let's get together to fight this holy amygdala so when the man comes there will be no no doom
