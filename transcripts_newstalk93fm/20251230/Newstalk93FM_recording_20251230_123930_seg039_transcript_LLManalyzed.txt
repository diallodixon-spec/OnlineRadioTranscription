20251230 123930 It's your time, baby. That's the difference when you're my baby. That's how it is when you want action Until the lights back on I got the one we could last long I don't even know my time Girl, like what I waited for lifelong I pull up in my fashion Every night I shit in any way We can go ahead and just head out Until up in my villa, take it out the whole whole night Just get in the drop top, take the head out Don't cruise with your head outside Go ahead, it's your time baby It's your time baby, get my baby That's the difference when you're my baby That's how it is when you're sitting on top of the world
