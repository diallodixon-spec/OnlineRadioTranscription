20251212 104419 I Come just now to say thank you walking You're not just a part of my life, but my everything Your love reaches way down deep within Passes you an understanding There will always be a song for you I sing One word alone just can't express my heart's desire. Gratitude for one more day must be supplied. Your warm embrace and tenderness. Patience with me through all my men.
