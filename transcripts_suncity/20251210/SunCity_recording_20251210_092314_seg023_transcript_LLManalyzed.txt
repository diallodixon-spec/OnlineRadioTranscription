We don't battle with other people as it tells us in second Corinthians chapter 10 verse three to five. It says don't we walk in the flesh? We don't wage war after the flesh but the weapons of our warfare are not carnal but mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds and casting down imagination and everything that exalts itself against the knowledge of God and bringing to captivity every disobedience unto the obedience of Christ and the next verse says and have any readiness to revenge every disobedience when our obedience is fulfilled. That means I have to walk in obedience to God's word. And right where we have David, he's walking in the obedience of God's word at this time, because we know he did bad things, but right now he's doing the right thing. And he comes to God and what God and God is telling us just like Jesus said we must go into our closet as it says in Matthew 6 6 where we go to pray and what David here is praying is calling on God and he needs God's intervention he need God to come into his life situation
