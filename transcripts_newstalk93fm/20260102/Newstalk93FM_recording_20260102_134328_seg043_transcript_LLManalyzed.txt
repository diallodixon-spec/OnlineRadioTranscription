20260102 134328 We could be nice to each other, nice to each other Wrong for each other, right for each other And rise to each other, rise to each other Don't know where the switches are And where you keep the coloring And I'll probably crash a stupid car And make your life a misery We are now at the end of our drive. Thank you so much for joining us on and it never works, you know it So can we say we'll never say the classic stuff to show it? Now, you know it, now, now
