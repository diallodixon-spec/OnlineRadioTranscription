20251230 162613 I'm telling me something less transparent Me no vex say you lie Me upset say you refuse to try With high occurrence Give a next story again The last one was I feel transparent Hope you no vex say me gone Don't get upset if I choose to move on Tell me something that I don't know Because we've been down this road before You know me now to lurk by your windows Me now to do it You know what I'm looking for Christmas gone! What will you want for your Christmas again next year? You have some girls that have everything already and this is all they want. All they want is trust and loyalty.
