It's a big thank you to you, in a stand, to the Boyer Tings family, for rocking with us, sharing your thoughts, and keeping it real every single Wednesday. We couldn't do it without you, man. Trust and believe. Now, as we close out the year, we're serving up a holiday special full of flavour, literally.

We're exploring all the joys and chaos of Christmas cooking, or Christmas cookbook episode for the third time you know it's a tradition you know Christmas are commenting but it is for three years in a row now we're going to be doing this and you guys have loved it and I stand so our question of the night is is Christmas dinner better
