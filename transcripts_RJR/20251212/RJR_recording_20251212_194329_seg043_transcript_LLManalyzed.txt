In 2010 he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame where he is only one of two Jamaicans, the other being Bob Marley. The Hall hails him as reggae's first champion who carried the music across the globe. He was nominated for the Grammy Awards seven times and won twice for Reggae Album of the Year.
