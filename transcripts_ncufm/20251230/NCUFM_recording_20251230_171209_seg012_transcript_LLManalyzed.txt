20251230 171209 was created to protect consumers from unfair practices by banks, lenders, and corporations. The ruling follows a lawsuit brought by the National Treasury Employees Union, which represents CFPB workers. Judge Jackson had earlier stopped the administration from dismantling the agency and blocking mass layoffs. She notes that the CFPB funding has continued without interruption since its creation in 2011, even during years when the Federal Reserve operated at a loss. The decision came days before the agency was expected to run out of money to pay staff. The case will next be heard by the appeals court in February. And that's it for the news. I'm Joni Lee Forsyth. The weather is next.
