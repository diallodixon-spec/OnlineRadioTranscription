I think I'm going to drink all the color of Caesar. I'm going to have some sorrel and... And eat up some ham and things. And eat up some... I'm going to tell you something., I tried to get some mutton, but the price ran low when I couldn't buy it. Goat, you mean? The goat meat? Yeah. So, $1,200, I'm gonna sell a pound of goat meat for now at $1,500 and $1,700, so the budget can't go up to that, so I'll get some beef you know, curry the beef and tell me. Tell you about the goat.
