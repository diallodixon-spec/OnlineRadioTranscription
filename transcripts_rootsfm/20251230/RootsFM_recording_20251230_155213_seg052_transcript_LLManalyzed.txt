20251230 155213 I used to dream of being rich having a lot of houses and cars couldn't know which one is rich and finding me a chicken getting hitched living the fairytale life perfect without a glitch you think that this would bring me happiness if at the end of every rainbow there was a treasure chest sometimes having more is really less take a look inside yourself you, you'll realize you're really blessed. No matter how you're sad and blue, there's always someone who has it worse than you. Sometimes you gotta pay your dues, so don't worry, just push on through. Keep it in real. Gotta dig up all my people who'll be working on the future, though they know they gotta struggle.
