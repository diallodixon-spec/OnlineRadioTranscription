20260102 101105 in my soul when my spirit is in two. You're my master, and I'm not a slave to sin anymore. There's a beast running deep in my soul. In your will, that's my strength when I'm with you Just can't stop getting closer to you With my mind I'll renew and conform to the image of you Let the peace run in me from my soul
