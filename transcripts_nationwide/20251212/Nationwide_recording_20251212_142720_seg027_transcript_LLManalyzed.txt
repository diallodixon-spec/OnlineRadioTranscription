2025-12-12 14:59:17 With those holiday greetings and gay happy meetings when friends come to call It's the happiest season of all There'll be parties for hosting, marshmallows for toasting and caroling out in the snow There'll be scary ghost stories and tales of the glories of Christmases long, long ago It's the most wonderful time of the year In these moments, moments of our life, in all the world is love.
