20251231 194040 Race 7 is the Mackay Security Sprint T horses. Last time he ran for the same tag. Won by a short-legged okay-boy, nearly lasted. But Dave Nelson was too good......about the land of Icardi and got the job done. So I'm expecting this American to continue on his winning race. And to do it at the expense number 4 casualty, who is fairly consistent when she puts her mind to it. I'm expecting from well off the pace, not as Bushman to be cutting down the leaders and make it into the frame. Race number 8.
