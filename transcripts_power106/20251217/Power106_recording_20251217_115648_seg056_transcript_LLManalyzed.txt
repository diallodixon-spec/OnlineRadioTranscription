20251217 115648 Omar was a finance minister, she is finance, A-N-T-S. I guess this is in relation to the discussion about Omar Davis and Faber Williams as to who is the better minister of finance. It's such a non-argument that it serves no purpose whatsoever in taking us forward. But again, just a reminder that Omar Davis was Minister of Finance for 14 consecutive years. So teething America is at it again. This time it's against Venezuela under the guise of drugs trafficking. We know it's all about the oil. If it's about drugs, why don't they go and blockade China where fentanyl is coming from? These coward Americans only pick on who they can bully. That's from Jabir. Yeah, we know it's about oil and minerals and so on. Nothing more.
