20251215 193025 I'm gonna try to play with you finally Cause your love is a miracle For all of the things I can't let go It's all I've been waiting for I need to find my time In this black and alzheimer Look up on the railing I don't know what the payment They come to make a statement It's everybody We come for the mass We deserve it Tell them you're back at work We fit in and we certain It's automatic We live for the mass boy Who come for the stage, who come for the stage? As I lay in my bed with my head to the ceiling Say I'm drowning alone and I'm lost in my feelings. Somebody send me a sign cause you know that I need it. Carnival come back to me cause you know you're my healing.
