I'll give thanks and praise them to the most high Because all these things are abominations to the Lord God Cause they bleeded the girls dress up in their trousers And say what happened to your skirts and blouses? Why can't I man see you in your dresses? Cause these things ain't a judge and all pleases And everyday they're worshiping vanities And your greatest lust is me
