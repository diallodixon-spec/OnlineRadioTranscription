20260101 150403 Gastroparesis. It's the first time I'm hearing that term, gastroparesis. So you say, like, what it causes the stomach to feel? Gastroparesis, okay. It causes the stomach to empty slowly. I know some person would say that's a good thing because then, you know, eat again. But there are things, you know, you're feeling the nausea and the vomiting, the belly pain, the discomfort. That's not a good thing. A lot of discomfort and then if you think about it, the food is not at a point where it's going bad inside of you, which could cause other complications. So not a good thing, yeah. Yeah. So the advice from the doctors for persons with gastroparesis, eat smaller meals containing less fat and cook and chew your food thoroughly as mum would say, count it 32 times.
