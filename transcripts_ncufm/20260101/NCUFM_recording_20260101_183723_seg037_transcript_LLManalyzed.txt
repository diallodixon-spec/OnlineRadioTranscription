20260101 183723 I will bless the Lord. You brought me on. You bring me in. You've been right there. You're bigger than me. You don't know. But you were there. My God has latched me out. I'm the enemy's hand. You changed my world. You changed my tongue. You changed my mind. You saved my life. Can't nobody do me like Jesus. Can't nobody love me like the Lord can. So it wants me out. To take me in. He knows what's best for me. What's best for me in the end I thought about something else I always loved it when I didn't love myself When I spent my time doing it in the town He made a way for me somehow I stand here
