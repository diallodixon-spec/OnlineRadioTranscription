20251226 123528 Welcome to Job Town, baby. Look at people in the streets Chippin' down a lane It's how we break with the chain Come and taste our freedom, sweetie When you want your ways Look how you have in the places Heart's a groovy Look what music does to me It's heavy in a dam again Feel like a movie When you throw it back on me I feel nauseous again Let me dance tonight, I won't let you stop me Feel it with the music, girl Thank you for the love, baby Darling, let me dance tonight
