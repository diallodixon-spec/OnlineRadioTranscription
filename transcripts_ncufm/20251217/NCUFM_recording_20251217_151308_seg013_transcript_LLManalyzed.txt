20251217 151308 I just can't wait to feel this warm embrace Don't have to beg my best for heaven Don't have to walk ten thousand miles Don't have to make my way to see Jesus Cause he's right here by my side all of my face is reserved for me the cost of my crown is free all i have to do is say yes Jesus has done the rest Imagine walking on those streets of gold Side by side with angels time will pass
