20260101 185936 from this love is tough. Just love me. Falling out around. Deep as the blue sea, deep as the blue sea. Love me really and truly. Just love me now. And you know the storms will come. No, we won't run. Just love me, deep as a blue sea. Wherever the wind may carry us, I will never give up.
