Red coal and green, red coal and green Wave the banner for me know you're so clean Red coal and green Red coal and green Roots reggae music up in your bloodstream Red gold and green, red, gold and green And every man turn in a king, every woman turn queen The red off with the shredding up, the blood we set we free The gold stand for justice and equality The green is for abundance and fertility
