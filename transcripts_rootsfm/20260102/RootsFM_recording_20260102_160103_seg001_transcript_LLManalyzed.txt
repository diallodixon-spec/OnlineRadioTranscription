20260102 160103 As long as I know how to live I know I stay alive I have all my style to give I have all my love to give to stand up on my feet and try to walk along when people talk to me i just could not understand i used to look up in the face and wonder what is going on at the age of two what my mommy do oh she made me properly and put on my beautiful shoe. She used to walk me to the park. She used to take me to the zoo. She tried to teach me how to talk, but I just don't know what to do at the age of three.
