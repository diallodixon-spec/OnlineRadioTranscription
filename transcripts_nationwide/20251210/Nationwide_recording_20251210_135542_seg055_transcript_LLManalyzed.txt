Look at people in here tonight I miss you running through my mind I might even whine if you give me time like you want this darling I have something for you right there I'll catch you in a feeling Right up on your bumper baby I know where you from miss lady I'll walk you deep and go down there I know you're not easy Long time I've been waiting for you I have something for you When it's time to leave in the morning And you feel for somebody You could come and look for me If you want a job well then call me As the luck of the day
