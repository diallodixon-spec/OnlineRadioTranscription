20251212 154832 A long time on the DJ in a dance. A long time on a chant in a dance. I come from the ice of the area. I come from ice of Jamaica. I want your jet. Dance off the clock. Dance on the lock. Lick off the lock. Charge the wine cellar. People really see it and have to laugh. Oh, Lord. Promote around the site, you know, to laugh. How them laugh? Cha-la-la-la, la la, la la la la la. Cha la la la la, lala la la la. Can't find no park cause the dance really caught. Gate man a laugh and the cashier a laugh. Can't find a buckle with a car. I said me can't find no space to walk. I need a food before the food itself, Lord. The gate man and he might be. King Kabaka lyrical champion. Bond Chubba make up from the champion. Bomb squad crew step up in the discussion.
