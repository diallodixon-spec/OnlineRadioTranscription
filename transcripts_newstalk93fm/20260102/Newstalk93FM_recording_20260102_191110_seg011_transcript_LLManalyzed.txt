20260102 191110 I'll wait, I'll wait I'll wait In a while flexing you But me like say you happy best if it true Hotel sweet sky view No guessing what me happy do to you Apply pressure till rain Open place you know cold like main A toothbrush to the brain I know me can't take it out for a stain So me know say you will feel it, feel it Is this a dream Am I awake Moon on your skin Hands round your waist Music is love, and I hear a tune I play The way how you move it got me feeling away, away, away
