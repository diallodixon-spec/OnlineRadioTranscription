20251222 161912 So many people won't lick my skews So baby chew me cause I serve your tools And if I don't do your two by two You get to scream, you get to lose in your food So many reasons are written in the stars Oh my god, you're the reason I do what I do So baby make you give me your love Make you give me that love If you give me me, I don't go like go. Give me, make a cure, my sample. Feelings got me hitting on the freaky dance floor. If you give me the love, make you no disappointo Me I got you for Mando
