20251222 181009 TTAG packages are discounted by 50% down to $1,250 including a $500 toll credit from December 8, 2025 until January 2, 2026. This makes no sense, people. Why waste time in the manual lane when you can't just breeze through the TTAG lane? Plus you pay a lower toll rate in the TTAG Lane. You can easily get your TTAG from any toll collector. Just have to remember to top up by adding funds on the MyT- Williamsfield Highway on Saturday December 27 2025. For a full listing of these toll rates please visit the Trans Jam Highways website at www.transjamhighways.com.
