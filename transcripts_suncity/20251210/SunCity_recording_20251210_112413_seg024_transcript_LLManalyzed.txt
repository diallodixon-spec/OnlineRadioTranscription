This is no ordinary love. Extraordinary, more than special Every moment we're together More than love, more than enough I'm never leaving ever Every second, every minute Love and I've fallen in it With you and only you Ordinary just what I do Oh my heart is racing, I'm shaking Colors in the love we're making This is no, this is no ordinary love Oh baby your skin, oh my skin, ooh
