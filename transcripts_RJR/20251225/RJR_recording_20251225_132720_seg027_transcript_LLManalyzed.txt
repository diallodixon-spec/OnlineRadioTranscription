If you have the opportunity to help somebody this Christmas, and one thing I know about Jamaicans for sure, is that this Christmas, particularly this particular Christmas, a lot of people are not being selfish, they're being selfless. A lot of people are handing out this Christmas, and this Christmas. And for good reason, for good reason, you know?

Two live crew. You know, DJ Deli's in the building, Christopher Johnny Daly with you as well. Stick and stay in our family right across the world, right here in Jamaica. Let's go.
