20251218 091211 The wise men follow the stars, the way I followed my heart And it led me to a miracle Don't you buy me nothing I am feeling one thing your lips on my lips That's a merry merry Christmas. It's the most beautiful time of the year Lights fill the streets, spend so much cheer I should be playing in the winter snow I won't be under the mistletoe I don't wanna miss out on the holidays
