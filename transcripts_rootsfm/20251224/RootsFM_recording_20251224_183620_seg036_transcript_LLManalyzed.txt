20251224 183620 This comes to pass When a child is born A rosy hue Settled all around You've got the feel You're on solid ground For a spell of doom No one one seemed for long This comes to pass when a child is born And all this happened because the world is waiting Waiting for a child Black, white, yellow, who knows But a child who will grow up and turn tears to laughter Hate to love, war to peace, and everyone to everyone's neighbor And misery and suffering will be a word to people that we forever It's all a dream
