20251226 170704 I love my culture and love where we from. We get these powers from the same nation. Sweet like steel, drop the smithy's vibrations. Don't let the rhythm get you just run, run, run. Even you could handle it, German. But like when the man will hide We gon' rip it up a spike Oh lord, goodbyes and party, we lovin' Sweet woman, we havin' Greatest on the planet, boy Somebody radio loud playin' a song And it's goin' off up And if I lose myself inside this place Well I'll show my shit up If this hoes got unblast when the pictures pass, the madness ones up. Just give me one more shot inside my glass and watch me level up. Fetting like a hero. Call me hero. As I raise my hand, I'll leave the bad vibes on zero.
