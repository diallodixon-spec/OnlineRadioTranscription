Somebody radio loud playing a song and it goes and I fuck. And if I lose myself inside this place, well, I show my shit up. Empty socks, cotton gloves, when the pictures pass, the madness runs up. Just give me one more shot inside my glass And watch me level up Fitting like a hero Call me hero As I raise my hand I'll leave the bad vibes on zero Fitting like a Hero So go hero As soon as I reach the dance I'll leave my conduct on zero. Betting like a hero. Oh, oh, oh, oh. Oh, betting like a hero. Whoa, yo, yo, yo. Whoa, yo yo yo yo yo.
