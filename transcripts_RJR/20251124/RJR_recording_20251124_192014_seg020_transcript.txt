That one was way up there with my favour. even to this day and Eric says House of Exile a protest song it was massive on the African continent his voice blends into the music so perfectly you'll think it's just another instrument and who is this now Veronica in Rhone Park says how did they come especially the movie I still have it on videotape I've watched it so many times RIP Jimmy your music lives on and another listener says My favorite song is sitting here in limbo. May his soul rest in peace
