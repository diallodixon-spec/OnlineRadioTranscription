20251223 125140 To those songs that's fighting against my spirit I'm walking away And I'm not looking back Bowing down on my knees Begging you to help me Cause I'm nobody When you're in my life I'm begging you to help me Jesus Cause I am nobody when you're in my mind I'm on my knees yeah Help me Jesus cause I am nobody. When you're in my life, I feel free on my knees. Help me Jesus. Cause I am nobody.
