20251223 133919 What's back? That's a way of sorrows The night is young And time is borrowed Can I see you tonight? Nobody knows tomorrow If you know the fight Better hold it back We won't be here forever So love me now or never babe I know the truth is bitter So give me something sweeter babe, babe. Bend it over, I know your woo is over. My boogie spread all over me. Oh, but I see my mother. Ooh, ooh, ooh. Ooh, ooh. Ooh. Ooh. Ooh-ooh. Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh. Ooh, ooh low, happiness all over me. Can I see you?
