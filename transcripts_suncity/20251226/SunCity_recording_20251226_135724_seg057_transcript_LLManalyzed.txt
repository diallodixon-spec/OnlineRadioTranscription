20251226 135724 Join the music, folks. And I know you are too. All right, we're down to race five. This is, what is it, five furlong straight. It's proclaiming 800 to a million. They've started the loading up process. Bold move number one is at 14. Number two, Big Big Daddy is at 11. Number three, Quantum Star is at 61 to one. Number four, generational, 11 to one. Number 5, Catawba, good odds at 6 to 1. Number 6, Thousand Treasures is at 10 to 1. And number 7 is the big favorite, Justin Bigtime, 4 to 5. Number 8, Rejected Raja, 3 to 1. Number 9, First Offense, 10 to 1, and number 10, KP Choice choice is at 8 to 1 so they're betting this Justin Bigtime the big favorite but I think there are a number of horses that can we can beat him and I think you could start your double I'm gonna say by throwing out the favorite because I think there are number of horses that could win
