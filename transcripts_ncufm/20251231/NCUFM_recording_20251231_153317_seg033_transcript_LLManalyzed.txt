20251231 153317 pneumonia is an infection of the lungs and it can develop after a cold or flu. The symptoms may include difficulty breathing, chest in-drawing, fever and fatigue. Prompt medical attention is crucial because pneumonia can become severe quickly in our babies. So why are babies more vulnerable? At the start, I kinda hinted towards it. Babies are more sensitive to cold weather, respiratory infections for several reasons. First, they have smaller airways, so even minor swellings or mucus buildup can make breathing difficult. Second, their immune systems are still developing, making it harder for them to fight off viruses and bacteria. Finally, babies naturally breathe faster than adults, which means congestion or airway irritation can affect them more severely and quickly.
