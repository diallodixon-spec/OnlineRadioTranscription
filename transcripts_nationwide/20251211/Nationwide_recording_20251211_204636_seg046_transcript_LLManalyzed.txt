If you give them the framework, it will influence, but even if you give them a good strong grounding, it will give them a framework for disobedience. Even just the way they disobey. But if you give them no order and no rules and no guidelines, they might just disobey you for a while. You understand? And that is my thing. Also, I have a business where nobody else wants it. I have to discipline my picnic in a way where he listens to me the first time. And he needs to know that listening to me the first, it's not an option. Because I'm going to save you if I drop and bust your head. And when I tell you to come down, listen to me for the first time. Listening, it's not an option because it may save you from drop and bust your head and when I tell you to come down, listen to me for the first time. Because I rather you run and ball to your mother than I have to be rushing you to kids clinic on a Sunday morning. Thank you very much. And worse, not guide support.
