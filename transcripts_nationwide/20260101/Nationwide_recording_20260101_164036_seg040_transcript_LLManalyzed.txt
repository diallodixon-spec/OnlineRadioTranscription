20260101 164036 Nationwide 90FM, tearing it up live, live! Turn it, turn it up! I'm holding you so tight You know you could've been a hender The way you swept me off the field You know you could have been a broom The way you smell so sweet You know you coulda been some perfume Well, you could have been anything that you wanted to And I can tell The way you do the things you do, oh baby As pretty as you are
