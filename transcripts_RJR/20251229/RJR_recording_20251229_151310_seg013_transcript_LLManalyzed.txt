Go to mountains and you'll find us when you're black to me. Wow, that's a bomb. Ethiopia, Africa, that's where we're from. Glad that my nation going strong. You'll sing my song. All my people and me, all my thoughts, all your little children, all your roomies, I love. They ain't gonna see us fall, they ain't going to see us fall.
