**Financial Expert Anna Palomino Shares Insights on Personal Finance and Money Management**

In a recent interview on a local radio program, financial expert Anna Palomino, also known as "Anna the Money Coach," shared her expertise on personal finance and money management. Palomino, a personal finance coach, speaker, and author, emphasized the importance of financial education and planning in achieving financial stability and success.

According to Palomino, many young Jamaicans struggle with money management due to a lack of financial education. "We go to school and learn math, English, French, Spanish, but are we taught personal finance? Are we taught how to budget? Are we taught what's good debt and what's bad debt?" she asked. Palomino stressed that financial education is crucial in making informed decisions about money and avoiding costly mistakes.

Palomino also discussed the importance of having a mindset shift when it comes to money management. "You have to understand and accept that the life you want is absolutely possible," she said. "A lot of people struggle with that. They think, 'That's a rich people problem,' or 'I'll never be able to afford that.'" Palomino encouraged listeners to focus on their goals and prioritize their spending accordingly.

When asked about debt, Palomino distinguished between "productive debt" and "consumptive debt." Productive debt, she explained, is debt that helps you progress towards your goals, such as taking out a loan to invest in a business or education. Consumptive debt, on the other hand, is debt that sets you back, such as credit card debt used for frivolous purchases.

Palomino also addressed the topic of student loans, which are often labeled as "bad debt." However, she argued that student loans can be a good investment if managed properly. "Student loan interest rates are around 9% or 10%, which is lower than what you would pay for an unsecured loan from a commercial bank," she said. Palomino also noted that the Student Loan Bureau (SLB) allows borrowers to pay off their principal, which can help reduce the amount of interest paid over time.

In response to a listener's question about the best savings plan for $20,000 weekly, Palomino emphasized the importance of differentiating between savings and investing. "Saving your money is putting it in a safe place where you can get it back with zero risk," she said. "Investing, on the other hand, involves taking on risk in exchange for potential returns." Palomino encouraged listeners to consider their financial goals and risk tolerance before making investment decisions.

Overall, Palomino's interview provided valuable insights and practical advice on personal finance and money management. Her expertise and passion for financial education make her a trusted resource for individuals seeking to improve their financial literacy and achieve financial stability.
