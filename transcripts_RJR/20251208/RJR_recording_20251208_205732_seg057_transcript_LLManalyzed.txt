We live love on Christmas Day. In your mind, you gotta take the time. In your heart, you gotta lay your heart. Our prophet raging in South Africa. Starving children over Ethiopia. One of the child born in the main angel. For all as a lamb to the slaughter. And give love on Christmas Day. Give love on Christmas Day, give love on Christmas Day
