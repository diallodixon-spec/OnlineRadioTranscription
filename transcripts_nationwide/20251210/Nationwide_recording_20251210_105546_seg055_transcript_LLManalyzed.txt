I keep telling people that the Jamaicans were overseas for decades. People said you can't get used to the cold. No, man, they're at school and the teacher's not coming to the class at night, but as soon as the teacher walks in, everybody goes silent. When this is not the case, it's not parliament, this is the case. So in any case, they're not taking the Jamaican people.
