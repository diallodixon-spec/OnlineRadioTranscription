Wow, you remembered my name. Yes, everyone who knows Fred likes Fred. Fred, thanks for all your help! Everyone would agree. If anyone will get into heaven, Fred will. Fred, I really appreciate you helping my boy with sports. Yes, Fred is a great guy, but his goodness won't get him into heaven. It won't? The Bible says that heaven is a gift from God, not something we earn.
