20260101 132824 I'm radioactive, radioactive I raise my flag, and tie my clothes It's a revolution, I suppose We're painted red, so spit right in I'm breaking in, shaping up Then checking out on the prison bus This is it, the apocalypse I'm waking up, I feel it in my bones To make my system flow Welcome to the new age, to the new age, welcome to the new age, to the new age I'm radioactive, radioactive All systems go sun
