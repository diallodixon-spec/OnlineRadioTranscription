20251226 135230 I want to explain to you That you're the hit on every corner Gotta confess to you, yeah Just what you're doing to this brother You got my heart, my head, and my mind All burning with desire And if ever I was given a chance Every bone in my body would be a fence Now baby, what do you expect of me? Now should I stand in the middle of the road, let something run over me? Hey, so that I can get your full attention Wanna explain to you, that all the hits are never recorded
