I like to be myself. There's no other way. I can't keep it just straight standard. I have to bring some of me here. So it works. And I'm telling you, once they hear that turn accent and I said, listen, this is it, they respond well to it. I never had an issue with class control. That has never been one of my struggles. Okay. What's the age group you teach? I'm at 7th grade right now. One of the artists. Okay. Because they're trying to find their self. Yeah. Yeah. 7th grade math. And the ethnicity of your class is what? Because I know I heard you say Harlem. So is it all African-Americans or mixed ethnicity or what? The demographic is mainly African-Americans and we have Hispanic, probably about 6 to 5, about 5. Some other races, but it's mostly Spanish and African-American.
