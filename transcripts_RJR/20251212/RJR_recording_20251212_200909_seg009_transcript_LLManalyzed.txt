20251212 200909 I am the flavor, you want the vanilla Ghost wanted, waste line is a killer Work on me like a oil rigger We're not back on all willy-liver You think I'm rude, yeah I just want to whine for a little bit Roll with me hands for a little bit, a little late. High out of my mind. Loose this in my waist. No shame. No shame. Washing up my spine. Making up my face. No shame. They don't know me already, when it comes to party I just whine and go down, and whine, and go down and whine and go full stop And everybody, they just talk about me With me hand in the air and I'm in me head, woah, you know I'm doin' it out Till I hold on babe, till I hold on babe
