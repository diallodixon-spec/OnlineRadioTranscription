season to be jolly and be thankful for all that we have. All the lights and decorations put up in anticipation of the joyful celebration that's on its way. We're counting the days till it's time for Christmas Day. Boy, God bless us, everyone. The good and the bad, the happy, the sad. Oh and God bless us everyone. It's your family and friends. It's good to be here.
