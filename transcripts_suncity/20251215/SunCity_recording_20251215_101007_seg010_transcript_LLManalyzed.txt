20251215 101007 take into consideration. Um I just did know that there was a pre thing. I didn't know about the pre hurricane packaging, you know, so that that is new to me. It sounds like a lot but then in reality, food is very expensive here. II don't know if I can be um I'm shocked when when you do the when you do the breakdown of what is happening. But may I say, we're missing 225 million, may I say, but wow. Then what is it going to take now? Because that's just food trimming. What is it going take now for the rebuilding of the homes? Because if this is just food, you know, I am now nervous. Because all these millions that is coming in will it still be enough because 225 million is just food so I'm a little nervous at this point
