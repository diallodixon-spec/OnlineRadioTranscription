20260102 160607 The Drive Time family, this next song that I'm going to play, I didn't even have it for next. I didn't have it next. Where's Ari? Let me drop it now. Hello brother Michael, giving God thanks and praises, listening to the songs, also the devotion that you did earlier. Just a missionary phrase, daily phrase of Watson, good day to you. Andrea says yes Michael, the right song at the right time.
