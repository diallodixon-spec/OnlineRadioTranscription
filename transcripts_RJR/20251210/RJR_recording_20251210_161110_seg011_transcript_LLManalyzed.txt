Tell me, sugar, it feels so good. Let me hear you say oh. Oh. Baby, say oh. Oh, let me hear you say, oh. Oh. Tell me, honey, it's feels so good. Burning with fever all over me. Touched by your spirit of loving. Serve me with sweet sexuality. Honey, don't call me down. Don't call me. Cause it feels so hard to be lonely. Just feel me. Squeeze me, tease me, kiss my breath away Sweet sensations found us Sweet sensations callin' me Love falls on our bodies We answer and oh baby you say oh Oh baby you say oh Baby you say oh
