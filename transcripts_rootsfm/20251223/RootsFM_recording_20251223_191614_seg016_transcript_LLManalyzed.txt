20251223 191614 They're wicked, they sell out the gates to youths to dead So when we jump, stop the fire with a peg You want to break and so you burn this wheel, babe Eat them so judgment's over them head At least they're them for a gig, yeah All they care about them farts, they don't care how the people, them are them So why you burn the fire, burn the big heads? I ain't no joke Stand firm for the youths, I ain't no skid Because they and tell the youths that fear and doubt. No gun, chop the fire from sun up to sun down. Innocent people, life, get gunned down. They tell the youths they've been a gun clown. The wicked youths sell out the gates, the youths are dead. So what me do? Stop one fire with a peg. You open the peg, and so your bullets feel red. Eden's a judgmental power. The wicked youth, sell out the gates. I live! Oh. Mmm. Mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm.
