Count your many blessings, every doubt will fly And you will be singing as the days go by Count your blessings, name them one by one Count your blessings, see what God has done. Count your blessings, name them one by one, Count your blessings, see what God has done. Count your blessings, spin them one by one. Count your many blessings, see what god has done.
