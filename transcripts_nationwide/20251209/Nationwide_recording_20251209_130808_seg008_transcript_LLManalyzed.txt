This bright light, fancy restaurants Everything in this world that a man wants Got a bank account bigger than a dog should allow Still alone now Pretty faces from the covers of the magazines From their covers to my covers wanna lay with me Fame and fortune still fine just a woman running out of time even though it seems I have everything I don't wanna be a lonely fool all of the women, all they get spent on cars all of the money don't come to you I can make believe I have everything But I can't pretend that I don't see That without you girl, my life isn't complete Without you
