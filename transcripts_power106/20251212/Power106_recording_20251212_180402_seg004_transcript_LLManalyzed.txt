20251212 180402 edition we will have a look at the English Premier League football. We'll be having a special segment for that coming up at 6.45. Horse racing at Caymanus Park so at 7.15 I'll be taking a look at the 10 races that will be run tomorrow at the park and just to tell you quickly there will be another nine on Sunday so 19 races at the park this weekend. And on top of all of that, we are going to be playing three Christmas carols here, or Christmas songs. Some people call them that. And these songs were recorded by local artists, I believe, and penned by local artists as well. The Immortal, this one is Immortal, it's by Home Tea 4. And once I say Home Tea 4, everybody knows that they are going to put us in a Christmas mood.
