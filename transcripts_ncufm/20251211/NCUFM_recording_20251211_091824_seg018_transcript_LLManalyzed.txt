Crews and family, today we pause to remember a promise that should steady us. God's divine power has given us everything we need for life and godliness. We often look at our lives and see what's missing. We see the challenges, the mess, the struggles, the places where we feel inadequate. But Peter reminds us that in Christ we are not lacking. We are equipped. We are supplied. We are strengthened. God's promises are not small. They are described as precious and very great. And through them, we are invited into something extraordinary. We become partakers of the divine nature. That means we don't just survive, we are transformed. We don't just escape corruption, we walk in holiness. Think about that. We, ordinary people, are drawn into God's extraordinary life. We are lifted up out of the grip of sin.
