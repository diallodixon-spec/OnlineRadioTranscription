20251226 155834 So We ain't got no time to drown inside the sorrow I see the future's bright and pretty After the rain and storm is over And it's bright like lights in the city But if you bust like supernova We got the heart of a lion attacking Fearless, we're not run for cover And we're not turned back, we are committed Going full speed and we're not pulled over Not pulled over, not pulled over Can't hold your negativity, if you go over the roots of our creation She works tonight
