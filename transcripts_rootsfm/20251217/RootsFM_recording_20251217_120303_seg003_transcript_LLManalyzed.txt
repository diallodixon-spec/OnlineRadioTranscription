20251217 120303 We thank you for this special moment, a time when we come into your presence to commune with you. There are so many desperate situations that we are faced with. And as we pause for prayer this morning, this day, this night, We believe that your ears are not heavy, so you may not hear us. We know that as we pray, we believe that there is a way that we can seek your face and get answers. We believe that we can seek Your favor, Almighty God. We can seek Your help, Your grace, Your strength, Your provision. And sometimes we even seek a miracle.
