20251226 200103 So don't feel away You don't like the fast life Look on the bright side I go take the blame I just want you come and light it up Just a little winding up Come and meet me behind the truck and we rev it up Whole day keep throwing it back I know why you stop Baby no way We could post up all the pictures you want, when you're ready. I go over here, darling. You go over there. But we could meet in the middle and start a bacchanal. Play in the middle, hey. What we gonna do now? Jam to a rhythm in the heat. I can't eval. But in the heat. Hey, what we go do now? Start a wine on it. I say compromise on it. Baby, spend time on it. Hey, I say compromise for me. Hey, can we talk some business? You know I want your company. And it's nothing too risky.
