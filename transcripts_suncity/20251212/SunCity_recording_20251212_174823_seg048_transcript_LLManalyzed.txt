20251212 174823 I'm dead for you, I'm dead for your purpose White man who I ain't a surplus Can't get the keys to your dreams and universe Can't see you live in a surface I'm dead for ya, I'm dead, I'm dead I'm dead for I never had purpose I never had, you say I never had I never had purpose All right, so when you tell me what you thought about that song, a song called Purpose.
