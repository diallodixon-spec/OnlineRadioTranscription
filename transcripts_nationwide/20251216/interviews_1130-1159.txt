**Interview with Mr. Carlton Regarding University Hospital Fees**

In a recent radio program, a host interviewed Mr. Carlton, a 77-year-old patient at the University Hospital of the West Indies, about his concerns regarding the hospital's fees. Mr. Carlton expressed his shock and disappointment upon learning that the fee to register for an appointment at the hospital's clinics had been increased from $1,200 to $3,000.

Mr. Carlton, who has been attending the hospital's clinics for a couple of years, stated that he had to visit three different clinics, including the surgical, genitourinary (GU), and asthma clinics, each requiring a separate registration fee. He questioned the justification for such a significant increase, which he felt was unfair and burdensome for patients like himself.

The host engaged in a Q&A session with Mr. Carlton, seeking clarification on the specifics of the fee increase and the services provided by the hospital. Mr. Carlton explained that the fee was solely for registration and did not cover the cost of treatment or consultations. He also mentioned that he had been attending the clinics for several years and had never experienced any issues with the services provided.

The host assured Mr. Carlton that they would investigate the matter and seek an explanation from the hospital administration regarding the fee increase. The conversation highlighted the concerns of patients regarding the affordability and accessibility of healthcare services, particularly for elderly individuals like Mr. Carlton.
