We ain't going away, we ain't going away Like we ain't leaving this place We ain't going nowhere, we not leaving this place Anybody fix, tell them fly over We jammin' all on we the shoulder. Girl, listen to me moving closer. Send your bumper right over. Then drop it lower. Then work it slower. Watch me in your review mirror. Girl, you are the greatest. You'll always be me favorite. No matter where we face it, don't worry at all. We go in places on all the biggest stages. We on the road to greatness, y'all. In one, two, three, hey. I don't need traffic jam. Me don't need the traffic jam. I don't even need traffic jam. We go in a ceiling, darling. In tongue, traffic jam. All I run is a traffic jam.
