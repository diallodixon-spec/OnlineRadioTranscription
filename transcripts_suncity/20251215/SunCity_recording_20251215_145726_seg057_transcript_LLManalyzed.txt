20251215 145726 God is always there for me Through the sunshine or through the rain Through the bridge or through the rain God is always there For me So I met this old man He was so poor He didn't hold a baton So we slapped on the floor He's always smiling Never heard him complain He said I've proven God again and again So no matter what the circumstances, baby God is always there for me Through the sunshine or through the rain Through the bridge or through the rain God is always there, for me
