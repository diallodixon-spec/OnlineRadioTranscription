20251215 154729 I've never had a love like this before Never had a love like you Sent for the chocolate Sent for the wine She don't want no roses She want to have a good time Light up the chalice Under the moonlight Who is where the heart is I just Never had a love like this before, never had a love like me. Just the sweet sensation of what she wants. The good vibration of what she needs. Sweet sensation of what she want. The good vibration.
