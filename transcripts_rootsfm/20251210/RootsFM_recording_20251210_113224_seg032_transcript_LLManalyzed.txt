============================================================

We have to look at the current affairs, exactly how it applies in our situation. So we have to talk about customer service. We have to glide it, make the people kind of understand it at their level, at our level, at every level. I want to move into another situation that we need to be so much more aware of and cognizant of, especially as we're entering the Christmas season. Now, I saw where a little girl went missing. Apparently someone picked her up from school. I mean, we have to be so careful. There should only be a certain amount of names or one name that, you know, can pick up a child. And this gentleman just went up to the child and was walking all over the child. And, you know, I think it happened somewhere in May Penn, you know, and walking on the road with a child. And they found him eventually walking on a road with a child and he could not give much information about her and so forth.
