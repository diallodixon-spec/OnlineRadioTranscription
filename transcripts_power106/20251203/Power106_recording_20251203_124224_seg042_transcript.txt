individual in question, the truth of the matter is that the public, I believe, will benefit from my intervention this afternoon. So I'm just starting out by saying this. Consequent on the passage of Hurricane Melissa, we suffered damage to housing infrastructure, farms, for example, road infrastructure, hotels, you name it, and other business establishments, right? We estimated losses in terms of damage to assets. Consequence on Melissa's passage comes out at U.S. $8.8 billion, based on the World Bank's estimates. Which is representing just about 41% of Jamaica's GDP. Jamaica's GDP, of course, was in the order of US $20 million as of 2024, right? So when you consider the 8 point something billion US dollar relative to the 20 billion US dollar that our GDP stood at for the last time of our thing, you will get 41%.
