20251216 132620 And I'm made of my mind, I'm in love this time And it feels so real And I know that he won't break my heart And I know that we won't ever part If time, time for us to settle down And I wanna be with him forever They can say that I am crazy for making him my baby But it's how it's gon' be See, I done been through many changes But this one I ain't changing, it's gon' stay the same
