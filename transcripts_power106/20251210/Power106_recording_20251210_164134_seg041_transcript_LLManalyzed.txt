I'm saying to you that the government is looking at the supply side. You're also speaking about supply and they say oh it was because of focus supply in the market so the farmers can't get a good price but the farmers not getting any money and we the consumer when something is supposed to be cheaper for the consumer so why we never get one cup of coffee in this country cheaper during all that time when the farmer wasn't getting any money and and the others were growing in the market, Jamaica is not a real place. You tell me one thing that works, like how is it supposed to work in a so-called free market? But we have a monopoly on characterization.
