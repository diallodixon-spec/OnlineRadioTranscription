20251216 173935 Minister. Absolutely, very well said. Now, wow, it sounds like it's going to be and it will be quite a grand occasion, this official celebration of the life. And it's a moment for all Jamaicans, the public, because he was not only about, he was not classist. His work served to inspire all Jamaicans. So the event, the funeral service, the official service accorded by the government of Jamaica to Jimmy Cliff, all the public. Beautiful. Open to the public tomorrow. Alright, so the official start time is 3. Usually, we ask persons to come a bit before. Is that the case with this official celebration as well, Minister? Yes. So the official start time, 3pm, National Indoor.
