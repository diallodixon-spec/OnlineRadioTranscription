Like a fermented product, people don't know about it. It's a lot of talking, it's a lot of explaining. You have to introduce the product to the market. Exactly, exactly. How do you sell the product now? Like you've packaged it, tell me about that. Okay, so they're packaged and sent out to the supermarkets and the delis. And so we prepare our kombucha, we ferment them. I mean mean our process is probably almost two months before it actually gets to the store. Wow. But that's done inside the fermenter, the fermentery and then packaged, bottled, we heat seal, labels put on and shipped out on a Wednesday, Thursday, Friday every week. Listen, we're speaking with Eileen Dunkley-Shim, founder and chief mixing officer at Nettie's Farm. We're going to find out more about just her, you know, her enterprise and what's she feeling about the future of the product.
