I hope you good, I hope you well, I hope you lit I miss your touch, I miss your smell, I miss your lips Maybe grab a drink, maybe grab some food, don't be a stranger I know it's hard though Hello Hello Hello You lift me up You get me up on me You drain me up, you rock the boat, I'm in no time I'm just a bit right now, sure was a bit on my mind I know you said not to call you again
