It's no 9'm pettiest. Pretty and I'm Pettiest. I'm pretty and Pettiest. You're not welcome. God, I'm gonna be sexiest. You need five beers so I'm gonna point it to your head. Bow, I'm dead. Got melatonin flow pointing us to bed. I'm doing you a favor, run me my bread. Pops and my back's the only thing that I do. Every time I pray, I thank God I'm not you. I'd rather die under surgery. Take what I got to walk around here looking like you. You wanna be for me, are you sure? Do she even gotta be at the award? Let me cause you're just a big laptop, you'll be a Labrador. Girl, I'm pretty and I'm pettiest. Pretty and I'm Pettiest.
