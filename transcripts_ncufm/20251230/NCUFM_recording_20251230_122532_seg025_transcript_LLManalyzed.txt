20251230 122532 What? Hey, what's better? Getting paid for half offense or living next door to a great neighbor? But we had an agreement, and you're not paying me. That's a bad thing. But I don't do bad things. I'm a good person. Why, I've been doing nothing but good things for a whole year. In fact, the most recent polls show that 99 out of 100 people like me. Doesn't that prove I'm good? Look, if you're not going to pay me, you can at least admit you wronged me. I'm willing to forgive you, but help me here. Why do I need your forgiveness? Everybody loves me! Well, 99 out of 100 anyway. The Bible declares that because we have sinned, we have wronged God, and any attempt at us being good is fruitless until we first ask God for His forgiveness. Have you asked?
