20251222 202618 You have been faithful all my life. You have been so, so good and so good with every breath that I am able. Oh, I always sing of the goodness of God. Your goodness is running after me. It's running after me. With my life laid down, I surrender now. I give you everything. Oh, Lord. Your goodness is running after me. It's running after me. Come and we'll sing it again. Oh, no, no, no. Running me down.
