**Men's Health in the Spotlight: Expert Insights for a Healthier 2026**

In a recent interview on a Health, Wealth, and Relationship Wednesday segment, Dr. Stephen Neal, Chief Medical Director at Critical Care Comprehensive Center, shed light on the importance of men's health and the need for regular check-ups. The conversation highlighted the unique challenges men face when it comes to prioritizing their health, with Dr. Neal emphasizing that men often tend to ignore their health until it's too late.

According to Dr. Neal, men are less likely to seek medical attention due to societal pressures and the perception that showing weakness is unacceptable. This mindset can lead to severe consequences, as men may neglect their health until they experience debilitating symptoms or even life-threatening conditions. Dr. Neal stressed that it's essential to educate men about the importance of preventive care and encourage them to take control of their health.

The discussion also touched on the significance of age-related health checks for men. Dr. Neal recommended that men under 45 years old with no pre-existing conditions should aim for a simple doctor's visit, including vital signs checks and a proper examination. However, men over 45 should prioritize prostate health, including prostate tests, especially if there's a family history of prostate cancer.

Dr. Neal noted that men are more likely to develop non-communicable diseases (NCDs) such as hypertension, diabetes, and high cholesterol, particularly between the ages of 20 and 60. He attributed this to the protective effects of hormones in women before menopause. The expert emphasized that men should be aware of these risks and take proactive steps to mitigate them.

The conversation also delved into the psychological aspects of men's health, including depression and anxiety. Dr. Neal highlighted that these conditions can be "silent killers" that men often hide due to societal stigma. He encouraged men to prioritize their mental health and seek help when needed.

In addition, Dr. Neal discussed the impact of work demands and lifestyle choices on men's health. He warned that chronic stress, lack of sleep, and excessive alcohol consumption can have severe consequences, including increased risk of NCDs. The expert advised men to strike a balance between work and personal life, engage in activities they enjoy, and practice moderation during the holiday season.

As the year draws to a close, Dr. Neal's parting advice to men was to schedule a yearly check-up, even if they feel healthy. This simple step can help identify potential health issues early on, allowing for timely intervention and prevention of more severe problems.

By shedding light on these critical aspects of men's health, Dr. Neal's interview aims to inspire men to take control of their well-being and make informed decisions about their health. As the host aptly put it, "Ladies, we can't be healthy without the mandem," emphasizing the importance of men's health for the well-being of their loved ones and the community at large.
