============================================================

Stand up, put those down on their knees And lend a voice to those who cannot speak If you shine a little light, give sight to the ones who've lost their way There's a place for people like you i've heard up there the streets are made of gold and when you get there there's a hand to hold i believe when your days down here are through There's a place up there for people like you If you walk around with your heart on your sleeve
