Lookin' at me eyes, girl, step to me. Come here, get in the room, be your destiny. I wind up your body with sweat for me. Lifting up the body from your every, every, every girl who waits for your move. Girl, you wait for your move. Every girl in the club, if you wind up, you wait till they grow. Every girl waits for your move, girl, you wait till you move. You have a cutie cup on for you wind up your way smaller than yours. Sexy ladies, party time. Wind up your body, you a call me mine. You ever blazin' when you raisin'? Get man attention all the time. It is a big afternoon.
