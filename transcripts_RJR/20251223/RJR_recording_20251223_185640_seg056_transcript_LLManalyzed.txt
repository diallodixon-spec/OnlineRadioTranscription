20251223 185640 It was more of the same in the second set as the top seed prevailed 6-1. there's very few and so I came out pretty strong and I stayed consistent the whole time. But to be honest I thought I played better today than I played yesterday to be honest I mean I'll props to Randy he played super consistent an amazing game just blew me off court really but I thought I played well I thought I competed well you know there's just a few few important points that I didn't really capitalize on that kind of turned the match away. The men's class two title went to Siretzi Bell who went three sets with Rudolf Jackson. Bell won the first set 6-1 but Jackson turned the tables in the second.
