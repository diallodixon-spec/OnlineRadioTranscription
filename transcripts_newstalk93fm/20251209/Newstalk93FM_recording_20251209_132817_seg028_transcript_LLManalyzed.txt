============================================================

I can tell, come give me hell from here Your fairy tale under your spell, I am She gets Chanel over it all again You scream and yell, can't come for help from here You're leaving wells, I'll fill your nails, for real I hit you good, you're sleeping good, for real I read you out, I read you out that shit out the box again Tryna see where your conscience is, can we keep this anonymous? Or you want me monogamous? Or what? Who may take the rubber on? You make it easy for me to believe it and love it You better believe it, cause maybe I'm living with something That's better than to give up
