20251222 095534 you would like the proposed amendment come to reality? Yeah, I think it's necessary as to how they work it out and where it is and what the consequences are. I'd love to see that. Yes. But at least to acknowledge that there is this issue. And I mean, I remember I was involved in the case, but I was in court at the time when it came up. I was speaking about it to John earlier on. And the young man, high school, but not, he was 17 and she was 15. Boyfriend, girlfriend, this is going on. Went home, mother come home early, catch him in the bed. Him try run away. And hold on to him and what have you. And before the court, good? Now, if you cannot consent, so he sends you that a rape. You should have sent you. So it raises, so there it is, so you have no problem.
