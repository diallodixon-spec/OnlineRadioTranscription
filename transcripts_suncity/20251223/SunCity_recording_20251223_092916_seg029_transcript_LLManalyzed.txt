The commercialization of Christmas is not Christmas. It's what others make Christmas to mean to them. But if you are aware of what Christmas means to you, then you will actually be grateful for the gift of life, the gift of salvation, you know, and all that you have, you know, it means a lot and it will just bring you back to ground zero and make you feel more grounded that indeed you have so much to be thankful for. Amazing. Thank you so much, Dr. Paul Smith. Really appreciate
