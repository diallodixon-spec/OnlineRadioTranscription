20260101 131708 I don't know what to say But it's plain to see If you stick together You're gonna find the way So don't surrender Cause you can win In this thing called love When you want it the most, there's no easy way out. When you're ready to go and your heart's left in doubt, don't give up on your faith. Love comes to those who believe it, and that's the way it is When life is empty With no tomorrow
