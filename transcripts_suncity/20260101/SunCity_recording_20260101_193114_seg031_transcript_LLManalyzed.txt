20260101 193114 If you haven't done so, just let the Lord know that you are happy that you have seen one more year. It's 2026. Yeah. Can't believe it. Sonites, thank you so much for keeping me company. Trust me, you have no idea how happy I am knowing that I have my Sonites keeping me company throughout the whole entire duration of my show. I really appreciate it and thank you for the support throughout the years and I hope that you guys will continue to support and listen to Sun City. Before I go, once again I want to big up the Track Road Barbershop and Complex Gaming team
