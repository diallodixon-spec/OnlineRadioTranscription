20251218 144839 Fireflies lighting away as we walk Words floating in the summer breeze when we talk What we have is endless Take away all my stress It's unfamiliar and still so brand new Every day with you feels like deja vu Like we've always known it Loved you before we met This is a fact, our love is like summer time. Healing my mind, our love like summer time. Ooh, feels so cool to me. This is a fact. Our love is like Summer time.
