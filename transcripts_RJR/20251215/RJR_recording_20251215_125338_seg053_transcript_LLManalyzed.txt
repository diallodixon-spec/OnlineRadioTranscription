20251215 125338 Hello? Okay. Let's try again. Hello? Are you hearing me rather? I'm getting a feedback. Don't know what's happening on that line. Let's try one more time. Good afternoon. Welcome to Hotline. This is Clive Mullings. Sir Clive. Ah, how are you? Welcome. I'm good sir, how are you doing? I'm giving thanks for yet another day. I tell you man, sun's shining. I tell you. I know you tried to throw some light on an issue this morning, but it's clarified. But I'm not so certain that you really clarified, that you really clarified it, you know. And if you did, then I'm certainly disappointed. I mean, at this stage, the U.S. has been active in the region against Venezuela.
