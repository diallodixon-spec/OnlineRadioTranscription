Y'all expensive and dear like woe Oochie bobs, I'm your favorite From my hair to my toenails, they're right on one man I'm gonna share it Every queen to her king, I wear my trompe. I'm not putting, I'm not putting to play here. Put a little lemonade on the side, I stole. Bad, bad girl in another place. Man, I lose gear when it pass through. Near my number, I school. This is one girl that me can't fool down. Till here can't pass through. Gloves go bright, they call me Spotlight. Only time I trip is when I'm on flight. Coca-Cola shape, I don't know.
