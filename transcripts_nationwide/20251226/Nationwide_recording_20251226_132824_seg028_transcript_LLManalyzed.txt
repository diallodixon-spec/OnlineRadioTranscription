20251226 132824 Every day, I need somebody to love, somebody to kiss. Somebody to pull down your body when you see me. I got the house on me, get up on me, back down where me sit. We look down the road, me side to side, like a chicky. Not the road to look for a house and fish. Oh Biggie, Biggie, better let's go in reverse. Roll on your own, we'll come first. Biggie, biggie, better let us go in reverse. Feel it on your bumbo, feel it up behind you. Have a little sleeper, and watch me ride it. But don't drop your gun, spook the gun. Spook the gun, spook, spook, the gun. Roll, roll, roll on your own. We'll come first.
