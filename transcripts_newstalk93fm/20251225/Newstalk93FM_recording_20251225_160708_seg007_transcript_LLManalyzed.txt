20251225 160708 you could enjoy yourself when you feel the passion swell we have it, sweet woman, we have it, greatest on the planet, boy. Somebody radio loud, playin' a song and it goes in the fuck. And if I lose myself inside this place, well, I show my shit up. If this hookah unblast when the bitch up past, the madness won't stop. Just give me one more shot inside my glass and watch me level up. Pretend like a hero, call me a hero. As I raise my hand, I'll leave the bad fights on zero. Fiting like a hero. Soak a hero. As soon as I reach the dance, I'll leave my conduct on zero. Oh, oh.
