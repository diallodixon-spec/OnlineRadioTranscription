Prime Minister Favel Williams. Melissa, the strongest hurricane to strike Jamaica, caused an estimated U.S. $8.8 billion or $1.42 trillion in physical damage. That's equivalent to 41 percent of the country's 2024 GDP, making it the costliest hurricane in the nation's recorded history. The Planning Institute of Jamaica has projected the Jamaican economy to contract by 11 to 13 percent in the December 2025 quarter, the sharpest decline since the COVID-19 pandemic. The World Bank is warning in debt service than they received in new financing between 2022 and 2024, the widest gap in at least 15 years.
