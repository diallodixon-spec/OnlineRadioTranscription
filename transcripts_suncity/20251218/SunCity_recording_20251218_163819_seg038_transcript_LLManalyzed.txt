20251218 163819 I know it's been a long time But there's something on my mind You see, I haven't been the same From that cold November day We said we needed space But all we found was an empty place And the only things I learned Is that I need you desperately So here I am And can you please tell me Where do broken hearts go? Can they find their way home? Back to the open arms of a love that's waiting there.
