20251215 204127 I know I'm a wee under the mistletoe Shorty with you Shorty with you Under the mistletoe the wise men follow the stars the way i follow my heart and it led me to a miracle hey love don't you buy me that because i am feeling one thing Your lips on my lips That's a Merry Merry Christmas It's the most beautiful time of the year Lights fill the streets, spend so much cheer I should be playing in the winter snow I won't be under the mist
