maybe after the break as we try to get Laurie Farron on. This is conversations with the NHD. Hello, morning. 2178, can't hear yet. All right, we'll be taking the calls after and we'll try to get our support online. Try and make your calls come in so we will hear and take as many as we can thereafter. This is Conversations on the Hotline. Let's protect our children, no matter where they are. If something doesn't feel right, speak up. Every child deserves to be safe. A message brought to you by UNICEF.
