============================================================

He brought us salvation, that blessed Christmas morn. Go tell it on the mountain, over the hills and everywhere. Go tell on the mountain, Jesus Christ is born. The stars are brightly shining on and above it. It is the night of the dear Savior's birth. Long lay the world in sin and error pining.
