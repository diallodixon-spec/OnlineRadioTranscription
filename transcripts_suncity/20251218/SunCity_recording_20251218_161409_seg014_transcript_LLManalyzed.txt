20251218 161409 Oh, you're the one who saw me through, through it all. You were my strength when I was weak. You were my voice when I couldn't speak. You were my eyes when I couldn't see. You saw the best there was in me, lifted me up when I couldn't reach You gave me faith cause you believed I'm everything I am Because you loved me You gave me wings and made me fly. You touched my head like you touched the sky. My looks to my face, you gave it back to me. You saved my star as I reached, you stood by me.
