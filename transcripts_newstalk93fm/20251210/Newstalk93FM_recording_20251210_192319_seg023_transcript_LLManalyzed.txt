It's Cardi, it's Cardi. Kehlani, Kehlani. It's you and I, baby. I, I, baby. Yeah, look, I don't need a rich just somebody that can make me feel safe, yeah. Look, I don't want a couple, but nobody ever made me feel safe like you. Facts, just when I'm with you, I just know I'm fine. Know I'm fine. You take all the pressure off my mind. All the time. Patient and kind will not be going out my mind. Say, from the problems, I don't worry, because I'm hard to find. I'm from the block, baby. It's you and I, baby. If the world turn against me, who I got, baby? I'll set you up, baby. Up in the flock, baby. I'm talking. I, I, I, baby. I know what I'm showing you right now. Yeah, yeah. I feel it right at home, safe in your arms. Baby, come hold me down. Come hold me down, huh? Save like a key and a lock on me. Save like a crib with a combo, please. Hold you down. Hold you down, down, down. I can put my guard down. I can pull my heart out. Love when you around. Love when you're around.
