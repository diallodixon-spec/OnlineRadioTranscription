Well, you can't tell by the way I use my words I'm a woman's man, no time to talk Music loud, women warm I've been kicked around since I was born But now it's all right, that's okay And you may look the other way But we can't cry, we understand New York Times don't make no man Whether you're a brother or a wife or you're a mother You're stayin' alive, stayin' alive Feel the city breakin' and everybody shakin' You're stayin alive, stayin alive Ah, ah, ah, stayin alive Stayin alive, ah, ah Stayin' alive, stayin' alive Stayin' alive Oh, baby, come on But now I get low, but now I get high
