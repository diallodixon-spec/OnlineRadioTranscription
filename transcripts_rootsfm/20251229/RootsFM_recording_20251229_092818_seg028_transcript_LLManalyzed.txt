20251229 092818 She let me singin' To who may need to know Let her on the floor Slidin' down the court Wanted love for show Both our hands were up Drinks was in the cup She showed me some love So we left the club Now we off in the Hum-a-Vee She's so hot she's kissin' on me This is a girl of my fantasy Love's all over and we were doin' the thing I don't know about you, but I would like to give it to her Nice honeys while I'm chillin' by the pool Red bikinis and some pump-hill shoes Who could think of any damn thing cooler? We at the crib so it ain't no rules Rum but nothing sweat
