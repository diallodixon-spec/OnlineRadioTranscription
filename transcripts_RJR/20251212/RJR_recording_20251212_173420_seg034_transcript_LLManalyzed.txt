20251212 173420 That announcement by Trump out of the US is really something that I think the persons who are trapped within the hemp of the United States would welcome. Meaning that persons who always wait on the US to do something before they act will welcome this kind of news. Because we're all of the view that Jamaica should have done what was in their best interest in terms of an industry which is not to this talk at all idea of even medical marijuana only which we do have an advantage in but to look at the entire industry so I would say it is welcoming news for those persons who wait on the United States but it's also welcoming news for myself as somebody who deals with strategic strategy and planning and enterprise because it allows us a greater degree of freedom to build out the industry as we should. Dr. Emmanuel? Yes well we welcome
