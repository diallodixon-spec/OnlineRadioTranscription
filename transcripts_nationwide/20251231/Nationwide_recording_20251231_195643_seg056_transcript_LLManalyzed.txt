20251231 195643 I feel so good to be bad, not with the aftermath After that, after that, try to get you back I still don't have a reason And you don't have the time And it really makes me wanna, if I ever get a thing about you And it's so hard to believe in Cause I don't believe in you anymore, anymore I wonder if it even makes a difference to try And so this is goodbye Am I spinning head, scissors that made my bed Now I must lay in it, deal with things I've left unsaid Want to tap into you, get what we're going through I'll get behind you, make you move again, bye bye, true I still don't have a reason
