To make those rainbows in my mind When I think of you sometime And I want to spend some time with you Just the two of us We can make it if we try Just the two of Us Just the two of US Just the two of U building castles in the sky Just the two of you and I We look for love, no time for tears Wasted water's all that is And it don't make no flowers grow Good things might come to those who wait Not to those who wait too late We gotta go for all we know Just the two of us We can make it if we try, just the two of us
