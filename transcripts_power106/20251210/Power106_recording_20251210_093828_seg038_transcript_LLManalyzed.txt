We can't get the answer. Well, the minister couldn't answer that question, although she was asked it by about five different persons. She pointed and said it is the minister of energy who is supposed to answer the question. The minister of energy was there and he left the parliament and she never answered the question. If we listen to what the minister of energy is saying, he says that he is relying on the technocrats and the minister of finance. So you can't keep kicking the ball down the road, down the road, you can't down the road at all times and we do not know where the responsibility lies. We can't be throwing it over to the ball is in your court, minister of finance, then you're a ball into the court of the Minister of Finance. There's no way. I don't know how the technicians could provide her with any answer. Frankly speaking, it was disgraceful. The Minister never answered any question at all. Right, then who you go into agreement, let us go on the bigger picture. Who you do agreements with the IMF?
