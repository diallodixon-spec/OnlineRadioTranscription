20260102 184030 I did not see what I was supposed to see. Taking it easy when a friend told me I was in danger. So much danger. Underestimating my woman, not taking her out. Working too hard and now she's going off with a stranger. Someone I don't even know. I should have taken her out every once in a while. Dinner together the French style Show her a life that's all worthwhile Now I guess I gotta walk an extra mile I could beat myself, oh yeah I could beat myself
