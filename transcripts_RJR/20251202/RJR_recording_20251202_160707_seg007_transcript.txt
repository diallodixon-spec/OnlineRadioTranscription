Every time I see you, got them feelings on me Kissing on you, loving on me I won't play with your heart Good and bad, thick and thin, flaws and more If you ever hit it wrong, I'll let you know Yeah, I know that love is unpredictable But I'm pretty damn sure that This is the kind of love that keeps me up all night. This is what I want to do for the rest of my life. This is something that can get every bit of my time. This is what they call real love. Real love, real love. Oh, I know that you told me As long as you hold me I couldn't be safer Oh, love me for the real me Don't know what your deal is But I'm with you till daylight Daylight, daylight Till the sun comes up Dancing in the moonlight, moonlight
