============================================================

body and soul so strong that it takes my breath away and I breathe you into my heart and pray for the strength to stand today cause I love you weather is wrong or right and though I can't be with you tonight you know my heart is by your side I don't want to run away But I can't take it I don't understand If I'm not made for you Then why doesn't my heart tell me that I am? Is there any way that I could stay in you? It's life to life.
