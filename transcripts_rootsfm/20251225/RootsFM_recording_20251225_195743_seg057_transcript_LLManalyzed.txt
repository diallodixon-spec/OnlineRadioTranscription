20251225 195743 Hell of a life, but love had a different side We had it, yeah, we lost it, can't get back to where we started Damn it always feels like rain, and it'll never be the same Oh, holidays are supposed to bring us closer But now I realize with you and me there's no hope I lost my love on Christmas night I'll give that heart at the same time Bout to be a new year a new state of mind but it's like hell right now cause you're not around on Christmas night by the fire while the snow falls down now
