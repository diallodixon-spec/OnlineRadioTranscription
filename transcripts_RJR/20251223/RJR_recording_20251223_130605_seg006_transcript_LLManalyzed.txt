Never stop listening, baby. And I never thought someone could love someone so much that give a voice to everything. So I know, I will be there when you need me. I will be that when you're crying, baby. I will be the when you need someone to tell you that you're beautiful, baby. I will be the way you need someone to run away with. I will be that way when you need someone to talk to. I mean, you'll love it till the sky is gray, girl. You'll be beautiful, baby.
