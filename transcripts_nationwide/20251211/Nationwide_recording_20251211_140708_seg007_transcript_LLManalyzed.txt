============================================================

I fall in love whenever we meet I'm asking you what you know about these things How will I know if you're thinking of me? I wanna fall for sunshine Falling in love is more than a dream This love is strong like I've been waiting for things And the sun begins to I'm gonna light up till now It's the light of day that shows me how And when the night falls, the loneliness grows Oh, I wanna dance with somebody
