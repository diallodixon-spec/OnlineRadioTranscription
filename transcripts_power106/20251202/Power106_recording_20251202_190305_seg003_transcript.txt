In terms of community engagement, we participate in health fairs, farm visits, et cetera, so that we are able to do one-on-one sessions with the community that we are having these interventions in. And of course, we can't do this all by ourselves, so there is collaboration with, rather, Jamaica Agricultural Society, as well as other agencies throughout PEM, to ensure that we're reaching our rural farmers, as well as faith-based organizations will also be important, civil society organizations, and volunteers. There is collaboration with UNICEF, PAHO, and UDPEM, as well as our municipal authorities for outreach and the provision of supplies.
