20251217 205030 So many men that work for my love. So many men that I kill for my love. Hey, yo. So many men get that shirt for my my love But let me tell you, I ain't really got the time To play no games with you, I'm too much of a dime You really wanna get with this one other time You gotta give me everything like all your pride My love, love Can't just give you my love. Love, love, love, can't just give me my love. Can't just give you the sweat, sweat, sweat for years.
