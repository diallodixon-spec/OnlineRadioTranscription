It's a reggae Christmas Come and sing along Feel the love and joy in every song From Kingston town to the Northern Lights It's a regga Christmas Everybody unite Drums are rolling bells go ring-a-ding Voices rise and hear the people sing Peace and love let the season flow One word, one heart on the mistletoe
