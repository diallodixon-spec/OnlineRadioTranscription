20251212 175332 For me There'll be no sadness, no sorrow, no trouble For me, there'll be peace in the valley I can't wait for that day when there'll be peace Oh, troubles will be no more On that peaceful shore Oh, sorrow will go away It's okay, there'll be no sadness, no trouble. No, no, no. I won't have to cry no more. I'll dry my weeping eyes. Trouble will be no more when I meet him in the sky.
