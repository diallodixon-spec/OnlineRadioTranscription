20251219 115732 Thank you so much for co-hosting again with me this week and we want to say thank you so much to Nicola from Source Farm you're doing some great work well. And coming up this weekend, the great work you're going to be doing in Belmont with the children. And Christine, you'll be at Kingston Creatives on Sunday with your Country Girl classics. Wow. We love the vibe. We love the energy. And once again, we say thanks to Carita McDonald, talking about culture works, skyline levels. Thank you all. Really appreciate it. And we're looking forward to the next... And thank you, Isis. Oh, you're welcome, my dear. You're welcome.
