Red, gold and green, red, gold and green and talk. We say we come back up like sardines, dying from hunger, the fever, my lily. So we are going to read, we write. When I look at that, it's a cry. You go, read out, we write, ah, ah. They're my peace, and we're mine. You go, we don't rewrite. Slippery is a cry. We don't rewrite. At the wrong people, I do the time.
