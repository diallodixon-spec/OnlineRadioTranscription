We cannot have mental health without spiritual health. So if we're going to have good mental health, we need good spiritual health. We need to rebuild the family altar. An altarless home becomes an anxious home. A praying home becomes a peaceful home to this evening, my friends. God wants to restore. He wants to revive. He wants to do great things. So get back to the family altar and say like Joshua, so me and my house, we will serve the Lord. Father, into your hands, we place everyone in radio land. We pray that they will experience healing in the time of hurting. And we pray that during this time of national trauma, this time of disease, death and disaster, this time of despair, depression and depression. Oh God, we pray that you will touch down and touch your people and bring healing in your time. Make all things beautiful in your time, we pray. In Jesus name. Amen.
