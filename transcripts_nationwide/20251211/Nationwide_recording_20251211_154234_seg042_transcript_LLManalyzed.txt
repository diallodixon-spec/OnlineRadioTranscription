Yeah, that's just my hope for 2026 and beyond. The new gen both in reggae and dancehall Again, it's been done before and it's still being done Shaggy is still a beat, Sean Paul is still a beat. So it's not impossible to do And I like to say it's just Bob Marley all the time Sean Paul is still alive and well Shaggy's still alive and well and releasing stuff But but their old music, their entire catalog is still selling. It's still being streamed. It's still been appreciated because good music. We're not worried about trending them on YouTube and that alone. You understand me? But we're not worried about just being in the conversations on social media and that alone. Microwavable careers.
