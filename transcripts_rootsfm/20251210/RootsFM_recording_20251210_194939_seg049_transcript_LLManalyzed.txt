Magic, it must be magic The way I hold you when the night just seems to fly Easy for you to take me to a star. Heaven is that moment when I look into your eyes. And oh, I just fall in love again. Just one touch and then it happens every time. And there I go again, just falling in love again. And when I do, I can't help myself.
