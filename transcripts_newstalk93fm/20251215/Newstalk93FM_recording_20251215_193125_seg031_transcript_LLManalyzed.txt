Jump up and show me love, wind up, and show me love. Together till we're all in love, jump up and show me, wind up and show me. So come if we strung up together, no place that I'd rather be. Strung up together, right now is our energy. Oh My body's not keep up, people can't follow my mind whole week. Take your troubles and throw them all away. Get ready to run across the stretch. Get ready, get ready. Give me energy, real energy. I said it's okay if I jump it. Jump it, I jump it.
