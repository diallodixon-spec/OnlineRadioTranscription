============================================================

You got me feeling some kind of way, and it's just so unexpected. Them late nights went on my mind, got me staring at the stairs. Listen, babe, you know I don't exaggerate things. But every time you touch me, little bells from every step. The problem is one look at you and my whole day is through. I don't have to be away from you, stay from you, spending every single day with you. Got a million things to do, but you know you've got me so distracted. I try to focus on my grind, and I'm trying. Your kiss is always on my mind.
