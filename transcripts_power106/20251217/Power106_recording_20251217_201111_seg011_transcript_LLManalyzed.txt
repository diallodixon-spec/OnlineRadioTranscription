20251217 201111 since October have been recipients of kindness since the passage of Hurricane Melissa. So commit to being kind to others and to yourself even when it takes more effort because kindness actually boosts resilience. Next thing, a sense of purpose. So recognizing our purpose helps us to focus our energy, keeps us engaged, makes it easier to be hopeful, it fills us with courage and guess what? It bolsters resilience. So purpose can come from a pursuit to help other people or let us say to abide by a set of values. So to identify what gives your life purpose and meaning, think about it. Write it down. It might be one big thing or it might be a whole lot of little things.
