20251222 125426 I can call you a letter of love But no name did you sign Pretending to all That we were just friends when I saw you I didn't know that you wanted me to be you I didn't know that you wanted me for your being. You wanted me to be your secret love. Why can't we tell somebody? Because secret loves never last as long. Your secret love will never be your true love. I can't be no secret baby, it's breaking my heart.
