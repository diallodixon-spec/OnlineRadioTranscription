============================================================

And now back to Power Talk your messages. I don't know why whenever I eat something I start to cough. So I had some lunch and every time I eat I start to cough. Maybe I should check out the doctor if he can tell me why. I cough now more than when I used to smoke. What kind of foolishness is that? I feel if you just take a bucket, what's it, nots it.
