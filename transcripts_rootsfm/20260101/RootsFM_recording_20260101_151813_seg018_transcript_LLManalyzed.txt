20260101 151813 I can hear you screaming from afar Somebody help me from this high door to fall But if I do, would you catch me? Now take the whole thing from the beginning Press the wine and things become a feeling With all the fancy lights and glamour Hard to grab to feed, too weak to dance You don't know what's up with me I can't find food to feed my family My life is like an open book Turn the page, come take a look Oh, walk a mile in my shoes And you would feel what I'm feeling From where I'm standing things don't look too good, no no no no Come and walk a mile in my shoes And you would feel What I'm feeling from where I'm standing
