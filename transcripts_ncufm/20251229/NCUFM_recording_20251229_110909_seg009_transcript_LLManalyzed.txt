20251229 110909 I've never known anyone to love me Quite the way you do And I tell you It's hopeless, I've already noticed That I'm just forever addicted, forever Forever in love Don't tell me I'm a cheater Isn't it? All time You say he's hacking my heart and Showed me the right way There's no doubt about it Don't make a right way I'm lost without a care Oh, yeah. You see, he's taking my heart and Showing me the right way There's no doubt about it Sweet, our love was not a game You see, this love takes me higher I can't know what you think
