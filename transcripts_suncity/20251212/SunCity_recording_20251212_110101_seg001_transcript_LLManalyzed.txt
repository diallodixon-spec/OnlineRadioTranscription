20251212 110101 When you build a fence, it make all the difference. Step in on me life and take precedence. Be the captain, the pilot, the teacher. Be the head and the boss and the leader. Be my guide, me shepherd, and me keeper. Beginning on the N, U, and the Alpha Omega. Lord, I pray. I honor your name. Del your mercy. Whenever I fall, you lift me up, glory to be, oh God. Even when the platans came and tried to stop me, even when they tried their best to take my glory, I leave it in your hands, my lord.
