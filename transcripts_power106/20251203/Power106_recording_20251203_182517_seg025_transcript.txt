Let's look now at what's happening locally now. The female Premier League season. I spoke to a couple of the principals there. They are fairly happy. The sponsorship, they covered it also. And so on. Your thoughts? You know, kudos to these ladies and men who are running the new programme. I've always thought that we should have an independent body running the women's football program and thank God we have it now. I think we had a very successful season but you can still see the talent levels have become a low side but after Covid we had a significant dip because a lot of players stepped away from the game and then a lot of players were suffering from a lack of opportunities to seen for the senior team. So they had absolutely no interest in playing for the league. But the league, the organizers for the league has done a pretty good job. The coverage is the best I've ever seen. They have their own slot on TVJ nowadays and stuff like that.
