20251212 131710 just walk next to you and asking you, sir, I'm hungry. Can you give me a dollar to buy a bag of juice? You lost a dollar, you know. You own the dollar in your right pocket. Would you give it on to that little boy? Talk to me. We want to know. The white is busy eating. What is that he got in his mouth? Is it the leg of the chicken? Or is it the back of the chicken? But he got something in his mouth anyway. Do it, I got to play that one here for you. When Dove talk, you know what is a dove? But this time we're gonna be giving you more than one. Doves. I need to speak to our resident real quick.
