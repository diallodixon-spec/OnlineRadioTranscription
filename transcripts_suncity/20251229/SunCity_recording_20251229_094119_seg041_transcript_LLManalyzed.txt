You know, I always say if the two person want it, it can't happen. And in order for a relationship to work, it has to be the man that wants it. It's one of the hardest truths I think women have to face, that anything that is going to work in a relationship, it has to be the man. It doesn't matter how much you want it ladies, you see if the man don't want it, you see if he can't wrap his mind around it, it's not going to work. In order for a relationship to work, the man must want it. Anything else is failure, so you walk away from it. It's that simple. Sled says, since he doesn't know what he wants, let him go. I know it's tough and hurtful, but you have to take control of your heart and sanity. Give him a break and let him find out.
