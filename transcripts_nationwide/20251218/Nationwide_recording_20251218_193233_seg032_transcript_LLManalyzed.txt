20251218 193233 to talk about JPS like Bill. He doesn't have that moral to speak about JPS. All right, Kyle. JPS is out of Philip Parwell's way. Philip Parwell and his PNP administration put us in the condition that we are in to now. So if Philip Parwell going to talk about JPS, go one side and hold a corner. Good night. All right, Carl. Thank you for the call. Who's? Willow, good evening. Good evening, Sevan. How you doing? What's up? Good evening. Yeah, we don't want you back. We don't want you to bash Sevan, you know, because he won't know. We have two boys and we never see them and make them talk to you. How old are they?
