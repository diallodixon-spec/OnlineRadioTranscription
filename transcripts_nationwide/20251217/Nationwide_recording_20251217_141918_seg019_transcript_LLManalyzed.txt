Directors, managers and team members of the Lascaux affiliated company and the Lascaux Chin Foundation. Past Lascaux police principal, teacher, nurse of the year awardees, you're here with us. Thank you very much, and members of the media, ladies and gentlemen. We are gathered here today exactly 50 days since Hurricane Melissa made landfall in West Milan on 28th. These have been 50 long days marked by anguish, fear, worry and deep trauma for many who were directly affected, including some of you here.
