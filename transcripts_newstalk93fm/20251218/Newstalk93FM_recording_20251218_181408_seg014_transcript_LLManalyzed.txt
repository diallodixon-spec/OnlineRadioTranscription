20251218 181408 I love the way that you bring a vibe With your hands up in the sky Falling down and having a time Wine in season again And we have the money to spend and we jammin' down to the end runnin' with me cannibal friend me cannibal friend, friend, friend. Until we meet up again. Everything on site, you know. She dreaming to take a ride on me. Cause she coming down to pick me up.
