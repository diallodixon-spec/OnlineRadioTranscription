Gravity is working against me Gravity wants to bring me down Oh, I'll never know what makes a man With all the love that his heart can stand. Dream of ways to throw it all away. Gravity is working against me. And gravity wants to bring me down. Oh, twice as much Ain't twice as good And can't sustain Like one half could It's running more It's gonna bring me to my knees
