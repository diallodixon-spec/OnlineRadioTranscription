The Caribbean Catastrophe Risk Insurance Facility, CREIF, today said it will launch a new initiative in Jamaica this week in the wake of the disaster caused by Hurricane Melissa, which left thousands of low-income Jamaicans struggling to rebuild their lives and livelihoods. It said the Livelihood Protection Policy, LPP, is a parametric microinsurance product designed specifically specifically for groups most exposed to climate shocks yet traditionally excluded from formal insurance markets, creeps that Hurricane Melissa underscored the urgent need for accessible financial protection, and that the LPP offers a new safety net, ensuring that when the next storm comes, affected individuals will have immediate resources to replant, repair, restock, and rebuild. NCB Financial Group has reported a strong performance for the year ended September 30, posting a net profit of $36.9 billion, up from $21.6 billion.
