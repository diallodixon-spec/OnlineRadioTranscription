20251222 102011 voted in the last election. So what does that mean? What does that tell you? If I organize my church, if I organize all my church members, I could win an election. The point here is that it's a waste of time. The government should not be wasting its resources on that. That is from my perspective. What we should be doing is working with organizations that has pushed out their tentacles to show interest in doing rebuilding Jamaica right now. Start there, demonstrate it with success, build on the successes we have, and widen the sphere, and then we can start talking about elections. Right now, this is not a time that we should be, you know, putting our skill sets or resources into this futile exercise. That's my perspective. It doesn't mean that if they're going along with it, I won't work to try and build support. I don't mean that.
