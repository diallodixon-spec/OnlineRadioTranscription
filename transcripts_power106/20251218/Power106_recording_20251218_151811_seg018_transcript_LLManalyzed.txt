20251218 151811 All right, so we are at the power 106 FM Christmas in the yardard Farmers Market. Very good support coming from the Jamaica Urban Transit Company. A lot of their employees came on down to support us today. The employees here on location at 32 Lindhurst Road, they have been supporting. They have been coming from North Street. They have been buying their farm produce. Mr. Thompson, I see some of them come back all 10 times. It is just fascinating to me. And then they were complaining that they didn't have enough money in the machine. Well, the machine will have money in there now, so nobody can't complain anymore about not being able to buy.
