20260102 161110 When the weather is fine And clouds have gone by I go up in the air Waving people goodbye In my flying machine I go up, I go down, I go round and round and round. I can fly with the birds, I can float with the wind. I go up in the air, I can dance in a spin in my flying machine. I go up, I go down, I go round and round, and round and round, yeah.
