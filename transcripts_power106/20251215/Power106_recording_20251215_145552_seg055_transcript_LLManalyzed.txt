No. No, burying somebody can't make you claim their property. As I tell you, clients, burying them alone will make you get more blessings, but that can't give you the property, not at all. The sparkle paint can't give you property, burying people can't give you a property. They would have to will it to you, or if they don't have a will, then the person like me you know trying to say that I used to take care of him so I should be the next of kin no next of kin don't come like that next of kin is blood
