20251215 191113 Last night, love you till the sun starts to smile Tell your son you need that nice Kick it in the gear and rev it like a G-Wagon I'll take it for a ride Then we'll dealin' off with a little side No worry about your man tonight Cause I know I'll show the money you sad, I bring the light Your body neat, you're very cute We love each other like one for the storybooks He loves me far, so catch me who? He said he'd be a champion honeymoon I really do like me desperate So me and you, if we touch today I I will eat you like a desperate. Me believe in you fool. And you, call any time when you are feeling you. Movie be starring you. You are the star in my private room. Tell you a day about this, you know me loving you.
