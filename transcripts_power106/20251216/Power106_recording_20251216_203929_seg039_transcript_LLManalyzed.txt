Let them know what will be done in the event of any kind of emergency. The last tip we will share with you today has to do with generators. In the aftermath of Hurricane Melissa, there is an increase of generator use. They should be at least 25 feet away from sleeping areas to avoid carbon monoxide poisoning, and refuel them only when they are cool. Follow these tips, share them with your family and friends, and let's make this holiday season a safe one. And if you have any queries or need assistance, you can call the nearest fire station. Thank you for tuning in. I'm Anne-Joy James-Soyuz. A production of the Jamaica Information Service, the voice of Jamaica.
