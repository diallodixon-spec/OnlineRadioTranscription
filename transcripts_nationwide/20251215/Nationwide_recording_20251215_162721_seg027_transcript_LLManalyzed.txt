It's a lot. It requires so much of me. But it is something that I do with all pleasure because I do it as unto God. That's really what it is. And I'm just constantly driven by doing whatever it takes to just honor God and to fulfill our purpose. So whatever my calling is, what his calling is, my job is to just be a guide, you know, that really help me to allow all of us in our little family, family of four, to be able to actualize that. So I don't really balance, I won't tell you that much because at work I'm a part of the school's leadership team. I'm in administration in an educational institution, won't call the name.
