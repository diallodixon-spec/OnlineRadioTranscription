Good afternoon from downtown Kingston, Jamaica to the world. I am your favorite locked goddess this thing I want to be alongside. Kareem Boya Tings and DJ Jerome in Ones and Twos. That's correct. You're in the E-Zone it's got a buzz. And a bug at it. Pretty good in the neighborhood how are you? I'm good I'm alive and I'm well. Give thanks how are you DJ Jerome?
