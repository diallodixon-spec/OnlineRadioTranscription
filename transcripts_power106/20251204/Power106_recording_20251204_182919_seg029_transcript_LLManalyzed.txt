============================================================

I believe that we just have to reflect on what happened last night and get the players then calm and get them back together because we still have a chance. We have a chance to still make it to the World Cup. If we come with a foreign coach, the same thing. We can't start over. We can only build on what we have now and see where it takes us. So quickly get in a coach and get the players then back, mine ready again. Because all of us disappointed. We were looking forward for a public holiday today. We were looking for that.
