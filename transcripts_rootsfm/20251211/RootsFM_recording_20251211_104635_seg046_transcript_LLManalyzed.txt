To light up their generators people going for food and this man was one of them He went to get food for his family and he became our guide and showed us the way, right? Okay, so it took how long to get to all those nine miles to get the blessed assurance three good hours three good hours We left around two and reached past five. So you stopped at points the rest, right? Not really. You just took that walk? Because we wanted to walk and reach and what motivated us was the damage that we saw along the way. There is a river that runs through Blessed Assurance and as we are reaching the city it became wider and wider and wider and we're like, if it's wider this side, what about where it's coming from? And we want to see how much damage is left there and how much survival is there, because we haven't heard anything. So it's better we rush and reach there earlier. So that was what propelled you to keep moving. And then come back, we will try and rest and see how much.
