So if you know Him to be your Father and He cares for you, come on and stand on your feet and help me praise Him in heaven. Come on, come on. Stand! Oh, come on and worship with me. Stand! So whatever. Come on through, I promise you, I'll spend my whole life with you. Jesus, my whole life has changed. Since that day I got on my knees. So for every time. Oh come on in Houston, I promise. Come on in and help me worship.
