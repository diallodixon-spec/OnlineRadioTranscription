20251216 194535 The way you got me all in my head I think I'm better than you in my bed Whatever it is, you know I can take it I've tried in a day and so many days Still I can see you again You're listening to Sleek Radio, 93 FM. I still in my mind, boy, boy, boy. Nobody no believe in a love again, because in love then lost. Nobody no believe, in a God again, it seems all faith is gone. Nobody no believe and it hurts my heart. Thunder lights on the world.
