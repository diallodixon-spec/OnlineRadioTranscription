And tomorrow never comes. Words don't matter now, because all we have is our yesterday. Would you promise to be OK? In all the things you did, moments live, but you let one flip away I can lose it all. The money in the bank. The world forgets my name. I can't lose it all. One thing that is true. If I wake up now.
