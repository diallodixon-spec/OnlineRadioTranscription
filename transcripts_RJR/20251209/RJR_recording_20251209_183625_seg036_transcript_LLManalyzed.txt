2.30 this afternoon, Anka was seen at school, they don't say which school, wearing a blue uniform, white tie, brown shoes and socks. She has not been heard from since. And they ask you to call the Maypen Police or 119 if you know where she is. Well I'm seeing something underneath it subsequently saying she's been found haven't seen the JCF update that all right so hold on that I was just seeing that if she's been found thanks be to the Lord for that all right so listen now I was wondering what I'm telling my cake baking listen I to them and I'd look at everybody. Everybody go supermarket, go buy cake now or bakery. But Veronica has come to the rescue. Veronica in Rhone Park, Old Harbour. She says Dion if you have my Christmas pudding you'd want to eat it all year round.
