We don't need power for most of it. Take, for instance, Roaring River. NWC Acting Corporate Public Relations Manager Delano Williams. Energy Minister Daryl Vaz is stoutly defending the government's decision to provide a U.S. $150 million or Jamaican $24 billion loan to the Jamaica Public Service, JPS. The loan is intended to support JPS's restoration efforts, with the goal of getting customers back on the electricity grid by the end of January. Opposition MPs have criticized the move, questioning whether it is a prudent financial decision, especially given that the JPS license expires in 2027. JPS had previously indicated it required more than US$350 million to fully restore power, with completion initially projected for April-May 2026. With a loan, the revised timeline is now by the end of January 2026.
