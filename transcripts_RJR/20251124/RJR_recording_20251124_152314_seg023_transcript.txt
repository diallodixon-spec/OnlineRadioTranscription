============================================================

Just touchdown and other G5s. You know I'm bustin' like a beehive. Use those boobies to justify. Send these prints by my knee-highs. I figured it's some of my dems. Fiat's puttin' me in a problem. Everything's from Paris, Milan, straight off they. Fling a ragga rhythm like it's so free. Bossy, house on the coach feet. Mama need so long, it doesn't know me. It's looking at my kids like I'm bossy.
