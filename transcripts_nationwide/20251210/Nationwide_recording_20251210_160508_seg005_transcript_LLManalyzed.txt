Me a be your body speak to me, to me, kiss to me, she got the keys to my heart Don't know which part to start Me a be that one, then I lock off the chat Crazy don't drive me, me a talk the talk I fall for you, no matter which part I walk Lights come action and you cause the spark Hey, can you put it up fast? I feel like a boss, eyes on You girl, because your style gone style gone You girl, a class, the price on Tell me the cause, living life on Don't need force, what a blessing Baby your body speak to me, to me Kiss to me, she got the keys to my heart
