20251225 183525 We're not feeling under the weather You just make me feel sweet Ice the cocoa tea, use the sugar And together we are complete, darling Heat me up Only you alone can put fire back in the soul Heat me up And they're telling me I should leave that fire alone Well the more they tell me is the more I hold in your clothes I could never let you go Miss Oceane Miss Oceane Girl, I'm coming home, I will see you again All day through the night, I'm dreaming Miss Oceane Where you turn the top, make it smooth, my darling When outside is pouring rain
