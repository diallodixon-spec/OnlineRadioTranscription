I can fall down on my face. So in everything, Lord, I give you praise. And that puts a smile on my face. Lord, I thank you for sunshine. Thank you for rain. Thank you for joy. Thank you for pain. It's a beautiful day, beautiful day. Beautiful day. Don't push and fight, let us unite Grab our lives and let's keep fighting It's a beautiful day, it's a beautiful day So yeah, go a walk through the valleys of the shadows of death. I will fear no evil won't be dismayed when I see the clock ticking away and things are not in place. Everything in life happens for a reason.
