20251231 210505 The way how you movin' got me feelin' away Away, away In a while flexin' you Come me like say you have the best thing for true Hotel suite, sky view No guessin' what me have to do to you Apply pressure till rain Open place, you know cold like Maine A toothbrush to the brain I know me can't take it out for a stain Is this a dream? Am I awake? Moon on your skin, hands round your waist Music is love, and I hurt to not play The way how you're moving got me feeling awake
