20251216 112619 we're having. Plus, greetings are sent from foreign. Every belly full from Christmas Eve. And Grand Market we have to clean. No one no gun shot to go sin of this trade. Put down your gun then please. I make we have a crime free Christmas time. No let bloodshed broke with vibes. No, no, no, no. A crime free, a crime-free Christmas time. No, let bloodshed rock with vibes. No, no, oh, oh, oh. Eh. Well, all I want for Christmas is to stay alive. Can't let the sound of the 45. Well, all for Christmas is a new-brand ride with a thick Empress inside. Cheese. No smoke, no foul, no hunger, no liquor, breeze. No one to stick up with gun or ball freeze. No brutal police to beat you till you wake. Christmas can't catch me in a foreign country. Black lives matter in Jamaica, too, eh? All lives matter, same thing with prayer.
