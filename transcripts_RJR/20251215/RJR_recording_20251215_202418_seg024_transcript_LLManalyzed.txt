20251215 202418 I heard up there the streets are made of gold And when you get there There's a hand to hold I believe When your days down here are through you There's a place up there for people like you I know you're out there, so keep doing what you do Cause there's a place, up there, for people like you Grants Morgan. Blessings to you one and all on this here Monday. May your weekend ahead
