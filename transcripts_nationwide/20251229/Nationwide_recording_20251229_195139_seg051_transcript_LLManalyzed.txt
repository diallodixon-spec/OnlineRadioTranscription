20251229 195139 other persons around them are there. And you sometimes get a sense that they're trying to dictate the flow of the conversation, even as they're trying to talk about their own health issues. And sometimes you might even pick up some subtle signs of fear amongst older adults, as if they're intimidated by having that other person there and feel that they may not be able to express themselves as freely as they otherwise would. And finally, what I would say, many healthcare providers across Jamaica know a scenario where maybe an adult child or somebody in the community brings someone to a hospital, sometimes for mental health related issues, sometimes for other health related issues. And at that point in time says, you know, doctor, I'm just going to leave them here. That's it. I can't really manage them anymore, or we don't have anywhere to keep them anymore. So you guys are just going to take care of them. And that's a form of neglect, as Dr. Laurie Chin would have highlighted. So both in terms of physical and emotional abuse and neglect, I would say many healthcare providers in Jamaica come into contact with that.
