20251217 153218 in my eye sight, a candle in my grip, and words that have now fallen, falling from my lips. These dreams go on when I close my eyes. Every second of the night, I live another life. These dreams of sleep when it's cold outside Every moment I'm awake I figure I'm awake There's something out there I can't resist I need to hide away from the pain There's something out here I can't resist The sweetest song
