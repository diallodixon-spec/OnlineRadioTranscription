I need you back When all, all I can think about is us since I seen you last I know I didn't have to walk away All I had to do was ask for space I'm telling you be on your way When I told you to fall back So can you come pick up your clothes? I had them folded Leave me at the door While it's still open I know it's getting cold out But it's not frozen So come pick up you clothes, I, I, I've been folding I'll let your body decide if this is good enough for ya Already folding it for ya, already folding it for ya
