20251216 184429 I told you from the day that we met each other I love the way you smile with me You got me in my feelings, don't need no water You take your time and bless in me To be with you is my pleasure And I will never ever ever leave you alone my love You are the one I need my love, you are the one I give my trust You are the one I need my love You are the one that gave my trust You are the one for me, you are the one for me. Basket coulda full or my basket coulda empty. Never see nobody with them things I'm trying to be. When you see us step up in our life, now how selfish can each one help one another? That mama tell me, never bow a low for the money, not empty. She'll never try to sell out nobody.
