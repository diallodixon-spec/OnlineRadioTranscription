20251222 194240 the people out in the West and Central Elizabeth, they have me going. So I just get the chance to really commend them and I want to say to Dr. Divine Intervention, you see, when you were an officer, you see, that prior, without, he's dead. My auntie always tell me, God help those who help themselves. When you were an office boss, you hardly give the security force the type of resources that this Andrew Holden's administration give them. And them are very liquid to work with and crime escalate out of your hand. So till you couldn't take it no more and you come on national TV with actually tears in your eye, I call for divine intervention. Look here boss, you are God as McCree.
