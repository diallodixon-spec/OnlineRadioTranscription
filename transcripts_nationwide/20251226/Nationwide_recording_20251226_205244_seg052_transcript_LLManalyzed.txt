20251226 205244 Tonight the music seems so loud I wish that we could lose this crowd Maybe it's better this way We'd hurt each other with the things we want to say We could have been so good together We could have lived this dance forever But love was gonna dance with me Please stay And I'm never gonna dance again Guilty feet have got no rhythm Though it's easy to pretend I know you're not a fool Should have known better than to cheat a friend And waste the chance that I'd been given So I'm never gonna dance again The way I dance with you
