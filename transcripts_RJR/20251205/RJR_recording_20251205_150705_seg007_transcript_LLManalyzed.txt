Your mood depends on you. No, no, no, you're paid, yeah I know everything you put up on media You're too clean, them say you think say you are Jesus You're too dirty, them a tell you say you're speedy job And when it's over, make them think say he's a sweet son Who you? No, please, man Today your gal is tomorrow, you are Galileo's Who you? See about the real ones We stick by your truth, we thought them is a real fan If your pocket empty Still wear a smile like you're fresh from the dentist Trying to make them know your business is all when you're tempted Friend on the ground, that don't mean we have a dollar or a million Keep smiling, don't make me see you sad If you have a honey or a vinegar Show them I'm happy, I'm a civilian
