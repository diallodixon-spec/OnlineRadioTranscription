2025-12-11 23:04:10 on the beach to the break of dawn. I'm going to Miami. Welcome to Miami. Yo, I heard the rainstorms ain't nothing to mess with, but I can't feel a drip on the strip. It's a trip. Ladies have dressed, fully equipped, and they be screaming out, will we love July's heat? So I'm thinking I'ma scoop me something hot in this South Summer Raingate melted pie. Hottest club in the city, and it's right on the beach. Temperature, get the uh, it's about to reach 500 degrees in the caribbean seas with the hot mommies screaming every time i come to town they be spotting me in the drop Bentley ain't no stopping me so cash in your door and flow to this fashion show pound for pound anywhere you go yo ain't no city in the world like this and if you ask how i know i gots to flee the fair Miami city where the heat is on all night on the beach till the break of dawn welcome to Miami. Miami. I'm going to Miami. Welcome to Miami.
