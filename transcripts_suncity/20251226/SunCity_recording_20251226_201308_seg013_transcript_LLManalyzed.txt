20251226 201308 I wanna be right here for the Christmas can't fly a reindeer that's a fiction you might find Santa Claus don't have fiction I don't know about elves and Jack Frost but I can give you dirt shaking with the hot sauce From your girlfriend lunch in her Starbucks Say she having a good time, kick your socks off So when you're ready, take a trip down to my island Cause there's nothing like Christmas in my island I've been around the world and traveled across the globe But I'm always heading right back home for Christmas Christmas in the island Breeze-a-rap-a-fum-pong. Purple lights and coconut trees, oh ruff-a pong-pong. Lillian on the island beaches, oh, ruffle-pong pong. Hills and valleys to the shining seas, oh, rUFF-A-PONG-PONG, RUFF-A PONG-PONG. Christmas on the island beaches.
