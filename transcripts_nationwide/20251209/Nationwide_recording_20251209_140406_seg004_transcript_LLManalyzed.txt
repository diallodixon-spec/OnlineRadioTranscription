And I decide to go out swinging If you choose, then you can bet Every single dollar ain't left you since then I will too And I mean it, tell me where do we go from? Might be my pride, might be my ego I can't help it that I won't let you in deep You showing signs you're falling in love But this ain't exactly what it seems, boy Truth is, I got my ways I don't wanna hurt you like that A little stuck and I might just double back Strings attached to them from my past So days probably won't last He got me insane I'm in love with a n***a that won't change Can't promise that I'm all in Cause if he come callin' I'm already on my way
