20251230 203816 I need your love in easy I walk through the walls of your fire My heart in my feet is no tire Now I'm feeling like I don't my own Can't believe that you're mine I walk through the wall of your fire In my heart, in my feet, is no tire. You're feeling like I know my own. Now I know I can fly. We can make it if we try, just a little bit. Just a little bit. Here it comes.
