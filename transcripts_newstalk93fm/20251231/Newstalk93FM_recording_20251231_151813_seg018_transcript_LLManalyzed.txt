20251231 151813 Hello? I hope you're good, I hope you're well, I hope you live. I miss your touch, I miss your smell, I miss your look. You can grab a drink, maybe grab some food, don't be shy. I know it's hard, but don't act like one. I have to protect my heart, and built the wall so tall I couldn't look over, I need to touch you One more time, one more time I'll take you one by five, not on the wireless And though you said not to call you again, I miss you And I hope I can see you one more time when I miss you Baby, baby, baby, baby Wake, wake, wake, wake up the phone
