We have to account for the funds that will be put into relief, recovery, and reconstruction. We have to build Jamaica better than it was before because we have to build resilience into the system. And I say all this to say is that the government is going to have to move very quickly now to ensure that the funds that have been liberated by loosening the debt target are put to work efficiently. That will mean being much better than we have been at it in the past. We have improved. Let me be clear. We have improved over the years in terms of accountability. But we have not moved quickly enough, and I'm sure the two gentlemen here will share that sentiment, is in building the capacity to spend the money.
