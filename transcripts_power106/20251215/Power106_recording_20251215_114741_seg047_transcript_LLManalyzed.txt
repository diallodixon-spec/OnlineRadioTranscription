You don't go to a doctor's office because he says a doctor but because sometimes we see a certificate displayed and that's our thing. We don't expect a nurse to be a nurse without some training. Yes. But in driving, we expect everybody can just get a key and just go drive. I have encountered young people who come to us to learn to drive. And when they are told that they need to have a learner permit to drive, the person saying, I don't need a learner permit because I have the license already. Yeah I'm just coming to brush up Starting from scratch, but they have the last night ready. How are we gonna stop?
