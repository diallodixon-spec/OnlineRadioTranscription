Stardom that is just kind of sketchy. So I want to say a part two. Did you watch the show? No. You haven't seen it? No. Are you living under a rock? No. You live in a one coma? No. So you haven't seen the clips on social media? I haven't been in the frame of mind for it. But I see everybody talking about it on social media and one name that came up was also that young lady Faith who performed who performed her last performance with Diddy. I can't remember the stage, but essentially she came out to say that, you know, it's not as drastic as some of the other claims, but her work relationship with Diddy was very toxic. And he literally said to her that you can't not perform tonight. She didn't want to perform and he just blackmailed her into doing it. He was blackmailing everybody around him. He was a blackmailer. I'm very sceptic for what she did. It's not dark.
