============================================================

I will always walk in thy truth. Give me a heart to praise thee, and to fear thy name. Blessed are are the merciful For they shall obtain mercy Consider my affliction or jam And deliver me And control me Jam you told me That I must not sell My soul for vanity God you told me, someone told me But I will rule, yes I will rule my destiny Oh job, I will rule yes I will rule
