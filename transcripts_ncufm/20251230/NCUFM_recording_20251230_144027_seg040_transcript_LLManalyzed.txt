But when we grow within the safety of God's family, we are not growing alone. Thank you, Jesus. We are supported. We are prayed for. We are reminded that God's purpose for our lives, it goes way beyond what our minds can even imagine. So today I encourage you, ask yourself, am I actively growing in my walk with Christ? Or am I becoming spiritually comfortable? If you recognize you aren't growing in your walk with Christ, maybe you're not in the right family. Maybe you're not connected to the right community. Ask yourself, do you allow others to speak truth in your life, in love? Some persons don't like when them get corrected, you know? And ask yourself, how are you contributing to the spiritual growth?
