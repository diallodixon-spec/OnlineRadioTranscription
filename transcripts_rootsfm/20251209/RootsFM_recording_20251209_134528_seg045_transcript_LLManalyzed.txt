You're so provider Oh baby Girl, yes I've been alone with you inside my mind And in my dreams I've kissed your lips A thousand times I sometimes see you pass outside my door Hello Is it me you're looking for? I can see it in your eyes I can see in your smile You're all I ever wanted And my arms are open wide Cause you know just what to say. And you just know what to do. And I want to tell you so much. I love you. Love you, baby. Love you, babe. Love you, girl. Love you.
