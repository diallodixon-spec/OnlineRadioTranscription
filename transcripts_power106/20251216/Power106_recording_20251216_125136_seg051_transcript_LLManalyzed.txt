20251216 125136 small businesses have not yet recovered from hurricane Melissa. We have a 30% increase of deduction in sales, island-wide. I was in Westmoreland over the weekend and I said to some of the small business operators that I'm not going to wish you a Merry Christmas because I know it's not going to be Merry but I can wish you a Happy New Year hoping that the New Year will be full of prosperity and happiness and businesses. Now the 7% increase you see, small businesses will be hurt by the electricity. Why? It's because electricity and JPS is one of the biggest input of operating a small business. You need that to run your fridge.
