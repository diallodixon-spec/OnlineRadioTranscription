20251224 161409 I feel your frequency from miles away. You come alive with one wine, baby. With you, I want to dance the night away. One jam, turn a lifetime, baby. So don't feel away You don't like the fast life You look on the bright side I go take the blame I just want you come and light it up Just a little winding up Come and meet me behind the truck and we rev it up Whole day, keep throwing it back at the way you stop Baby no way, we could post up all the pictures you want When you're ready, I could overshare, darling
