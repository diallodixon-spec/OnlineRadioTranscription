Permanent member behaviour also affects current and future temporary membership. We are in a state of friction. We have heard some UN members saying that they won't even run for election for a seat on the Security Council because they think that it's dysfunctional because the permanent five are so divided. And the more the permanent five use the veto, the more they use this privilege, the more they're discrediting the organisation. So on the one hand you need to have the veto for the Permanent Five to keep faith with the council, but on the other hand every time they use the veto the rest of the world does wonder if the council is worth all
