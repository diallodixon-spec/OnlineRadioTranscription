Right well as we mentioned I think in the last time we spoke this came about with Senna exploring some other options other than the GT4 Germany class which she and Tommy campaigned in last year and was looking for something a little bit more something something more cost effective. And the touring car championship, TCR, which is raced around the world. They have, they have series in South America, America, Asia, Europe, was something that he had explored and was obviously looking for a teammate given that Tommy Gore was going to campaign again in the German GT4 series. So I've had a close association with Senna and his father over the years.
