20260101 193618 Safe? Yeah. Look, I deal with a couple, but nobody ever made me feel safe like you. Facts. Cause when I'm with you, I just know I'm fine. Know I'm fine. You take all the pressure off my mind. All the time. Patient and kind will not be going out my mind. Say, from the problems, I don't worry, cause I'm hard to find. I'm from the block, baby. Block, baby. It's you and I, baby. Baby. If the world turn against me, what I'm talking about. Come hold me down, come hold me down, huh Save like a key and a lock on me Save like a crib with a combo please Hold you down, hold you down, down, down I can put my guard down, I can put my heart up Loving you around, loving you around, huh Unplug the alarm now, show you want my car now I don't need a rich bitch
