Are you seeing anything? You know, I'm asking questions because this made me feel uncomfortable. But nonetheless, because I want to make money, I want to impact students. I know some of them might not have the big dream, but at least if you help them and you motivate them, you can give them that drive that they need to propel forward. So I work with them. I never gave up. I worked with them. It was a big, it was, it was challenging, but we pushed through nonetheless. And because some of them have the mentality that they were not going to be given the subject to do, right? They didn't care about learning. They didn't care. So when I fought that battle for them, I said to them, listen, we're going to do our best. If somebody is saying that you're not good enough, you have to show them that you're good enough. You have to put in the groundwork. You can't let them say it and then whatever they say, you're letting it manifest itself in your life. You are the author and the finisher of your life. You're writing your script, not somebody else. So don't take what anybody says to you as gospel. You're the one that is going to make it happen.
