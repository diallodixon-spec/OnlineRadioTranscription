20251222 183637 Hey girl, what's up? So hold on. Why you look so vexed this early? Did you not just start? Lisa, it is so good to see you. But sorry you catch me like this, girl. My uncle sent one by line when my family got for credit. You don't want to hear the price the people put on it or something. But the matter is worse, I hear half of the things they're missing. And I know it's their customs. Girl, how you know it's her customs? Lisa, stop going like you don't have any sense. You don't see everybody talking about it in the media? You don't want me to stop listening to you. Have you ever experienced that? Customs don't go into your package, suitcase, barrel or cargo unless you ship the item or the agent stand up right there when they inspect it. Listen, customs job is to protect the borders, collect revenue and facilitate trade. They don't collect store shipments, they inspect it and somebody has to present it for inspection. So how customs ever get so much cost in there?
