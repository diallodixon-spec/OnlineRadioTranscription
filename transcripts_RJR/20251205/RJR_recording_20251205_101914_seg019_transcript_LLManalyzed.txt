You could be hurting somebody. No, no, forget. You are hurting somebody's life. Yes, but, Sala, whether or not you hurt somebody, you are required by law to wear a seatbelt. So the state is... Yes. Hold on a second. But you're comparing April with Aaron. No, I'm not. The point I'm making is that societies function where parliaments make law for the good government and the good management of society. So the seatbelt law. Hold on a second, Sala. You may think I don't want to be restricted when I'm driving, but the parliament has said for your safety we need to step in and have this sort of parental thing. So why you can't be unrestricted?
