Come on, do this next one. For the Lord our God is great. Come on, say it. I thank the Lord in all your ways. I like this, say this. God of mercy, Lord of grace. Come on, sing it to me tonight. Holy one, angels of grace. Here we go. I will bless the Lord. Bless the Lord in style! We'll bless the Lord at all times! Say it again, we'll bless the Lord. Bless the Lord, at all times! Bless the Lord! At all times! Say bless the Lord, bless the Lord!
