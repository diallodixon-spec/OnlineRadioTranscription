20251231 204220 You're the one for me You are the one for me It's unspeakable You say you want my love But for me it's tough up like stone Can't get no one to trust Cause I've played that game before You say that you feel me But I feel more than what I feel You say you're cut from a different sheet So broken and sore, they're an empty wish They're an empty wish, yeah I'm in a war feeling pain no more No more empty wish, yeah Me know I'm in the innocence But me can't make you stress my edge Right up in the wickedness
