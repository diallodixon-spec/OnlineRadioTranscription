20251216 185838 And I lose my sanity for vanity No fighting for anything So them can't use long if they catch me Whenever you hear me sing I'm from the yard to the top of the trap And I try to hang the key God God give me everything The meditation, it's so primal, aye. Love for them's turn up for nothing. It's like them on a spinal. No, the man on a rival, they make reprieves, he make tidal. Try to kill the spirit, but we have the revival. And no bad man kill them, call that the revival. Just give me everything, so me nah lose me sanity for vanity.
