20251216 135030 would you believe me if I told you will you believe me when I say affairs of the heart together we've grown forever apart all I want you to know is your love is life off and I'm a mere mortal again I'm glad that you're more than a friend. When your love is life changing. And I couldn't be the same without you darling. Oh yeah. Oh yeah.
