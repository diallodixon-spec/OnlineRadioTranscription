20251223 112330 I'm hearing through every Wednesday night us. Mm hmm. Okay. Yes. I'm an audience listener. And I listen to you. Yes. I listen to headline at five that you guys have. And that's how I keep in the know with what is happening in my country. Ah. Because you really want to know what is happening. Yes. So. Yes. Good. I really appreciate that and I wish nationwide all the best and it's not four percent. The amount of people that listen to nationwide cannot be four percent. Tell them through it, huh? Tell them through it. Yeah. But. It's not 4%. Exactly. Everyone listen to music. Yes. But you know. Not 4%. Yeah. And we take it and we taunt them with it because we know we are much bigger than four percent. So, we taunt them.. Every time I hear that, that's a four percent. I want to say more, it is like four percent. Please take it down. It's not four percent. Well, thank you Carisha for linking with us. You're welcome. And we appreciate the fact that you really invite us
