The children listen to hear sleigh bells in the snow, the snow. Said I'm dreaming of a white Christmas with every Christmas card I write. May your days, may your days, may your days be merry and bright. And may all your Christmases be white. I am dreaming of a white Christmas Just like the ones I used to know Where the treetops glisten at you
