20251224 153320 Hey! Hey guys, thank you so much for watching our Carol the Bells video. We hope you loved it, and if you did, please go buy our Christmas CD. It is out now on iTunes and Amazon, and you can get a fiscal copy on our website, ptxofficial.com. And if you guys missed us in 2012, don't worry, we'll be back on tour in 2013. You can check out our dates on www.ptxofficial.com and if you're interested in VIP tickets, that is also the website for you. Which is fun because we get to hang out with you. We do. We get cool t-shirts and a bunch of other pluses. Also, really, really exciting news. This year at the American Music Awards we're going to be there performing at the Kill the Coal alive pre-show red carpet event and it's going to be awesome. You can check out where to see it on our website.
