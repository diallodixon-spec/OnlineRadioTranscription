============================================================

I think you don't know and I think that's what bothers a lot of the labour rights and some of the comrades. Let me explain to you. If what you say is completely blatant and irritates my intelligence, I will not read it. Did you see me actually try to read garbage? Like sometimes you write absolute garbage and I struggle. Sometimes you don't spell the word correctly. That's not my business. I cannot attack you for not being fully literate. Let me level with you. I empathize and I try. I even try to make sense of what you're saying even when you're stuttering on paper. Yeah? I will do everything to make sure your thoughts, even when you write garbage about me personally that you don't know, you don't know fly about me, I still read it.
