20251226 103322 Many a times I tried it Baby I can't deny it I just can't live my life A day in this world without you What will it take my love to show you I'm still in love with you What will it takes my love To show you How much my love is true The feeling she gave to me Makes me feel so brand new I love you forever and There's no other like you This is so special. I tell you, girl, for someone special. Living in my world, it's only for you. The things that I do.
