20251219 112824 Donald Trump has signed an executive order that could reclassify ganja as a less dangerous drug and open new avenues for medical research. Reclassification by the Drug Enforcement Administration would not make it legal for recreational use by adults, but it could change how the drug is regulated and reduce the tax burden on the cannabis industry. So I hear people are getting excited about it. I don't see how it impacts us at all. Not a big thing. It's not like we can suddenly start sending ganja to America. Precisely. All it means is it's going to free up them ganja crops in Kansas, meanwhile they're about to prosecute you. California, yeah. Those places, yeah. And maybe we're going to do some investments, or somebody in Britain is going to do some investment. You better believe that. believe that. Because it's really about medical research and so on. Precisely. Yeah, it's all transactional. Yep. All transactional. And maybe the news are running the test. No, like say... Yeah, like say something big. Yeah, we're all dealing right away. Yeah, meanwhile we are here.
