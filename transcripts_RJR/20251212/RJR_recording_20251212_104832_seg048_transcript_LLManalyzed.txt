2025-12-12 11:19:29 We keep on monitoring for Jamaica. We have not started to see an increase that we normally expect at this time of the year. But as I said, we are in the flu season and what is circulating in Jamaica from the samples that we are getting in are also H1N1 and H3N2. Just to say that the vaccine that is out this year, you know, the vaccine is formulated based on what is circulating and it does cover H1, N1 and H3, N2. So persons are to ensure that they get the vaccine. We have a very solid network and framework in terms of how we monitor what's happening with influenza across the country right throughout the year, which is our system is connected into the WHO system, where we report into that global system so that they can have a picture across what's happening across the country.
