2025-12-12 13:17:38 Look, I don't need a risk To somebody that can make me feel Safe, yeah Look, I thought we were the couple But nobody ever made me feel Safe, like you Facts, cause when I'm with you I just know I'm fine Know I'm fine You take all the pressure off my mind All the time Patient in time will not be going out my mind Say from the problems I don't worry cause I I'm hard I just ran a little cross the play safe like we playing tag I got a big dog in a safe like you wanna play in my face. Yeah, you know, I know you know that I'm that right You got a girl that wanna get right When I spaz and I crash you ain't gon' dip right That's when I need you to move That's how I get right Baby I feel safe in your arms I feel safe Save like the money let it sit up in the bank Save like a cold with the alarm I feel safe
