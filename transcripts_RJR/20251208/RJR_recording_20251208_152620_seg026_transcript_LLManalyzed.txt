Oh You're such a queen With all your majesty With amazing style and grace And a smile upon your face You're such a Queen And I will if you let me Be the king that you deserve Your heart that will deserve I hope that you feel the same Cause I can't go away, won't let you slip away I'll be there till we're old and grey Cause I can't beat around the bush
