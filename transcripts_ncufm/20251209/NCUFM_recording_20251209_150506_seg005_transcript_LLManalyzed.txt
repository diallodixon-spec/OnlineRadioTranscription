heart tests, chest tests, colonoscopy, if you're over 50, pap smear, mammogram, a lot of tests. And then, you know, it comes together. The thing is, you have to have family. Since in the United States, there has, this is what, the fourth reported transplant, transmitted rabies event since 1978. So it's not something common, but imagine being that unlucky person. What it sounds like, it seems like, is a human error. It seems like they missed it. Also in the testing, maybe it never showed up yet. But if the man, say, was scratched by a skunk, then some human error come in there, so they're never going to catch it. Mercy, man. They seem to put the pieces together. Thank you very much. You're most welcome.
