============================================================

One of the eldest students, 19-year-old Peter Kimani, took me on a short tour. Where is your classroom, Peter? My classroom is just here. Oh, next to us here? Okay, can we just peek in and see what's going on? They are learning. Let me see what they are learning. They are learning chemistry. What do you think about chemistry? Chemistry is a bit tough, but we are fighting through it. What's your favorite subject? Home science and agriculture. That's the bell has rung. The first lesson has ended, so it's next to the next lesson before lunchtime. Peter, when did you enroll here at the school? I joined the school when I was a little boy, 10, 11 years. The school is a bit good school. Teachers here at this school, they teach us according to your speed, not like the other teachers are teaching according to their system and time. So before you came here, you were in another school? Yeah, I was in another school.
