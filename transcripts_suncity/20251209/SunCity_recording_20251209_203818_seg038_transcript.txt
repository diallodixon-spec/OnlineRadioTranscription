A rebuilding Sun City radio we a deal with. Stop the violence and the corruption. We have to make a better solution to the youths, them. You could a curse, you could a bust, you could a ball. Because the guns, them, them have to leave we yard. Yo, this is your girl Shireen on frontline duty for the rebuilding of Jamaica. What we say? The land we love. Sun City radio 104.9 FM. Radio with a difference. Radio with a meaning. Talk if you're talking. Or walk if you're walking. Sun City not playing. Rebuilding the mighty way. Young people just messin' up today
