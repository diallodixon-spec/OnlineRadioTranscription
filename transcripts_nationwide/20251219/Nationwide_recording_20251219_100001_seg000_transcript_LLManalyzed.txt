20251219 100001 No, we are not expecting greater increases. I'll tell you what is happening. From month to month, throughout the entire year, there's been increases and decreases on bails. And customers have said that the bails look different this month compared to last month. But the increases have not been significant. They're more in keeping with the 7%. So if there's to be any movement, it is not likely to be more than what we are seeing this month. It's likely to be less. But remember that this is not a permanent increase to JPS that goes into JPS's coffers. This is to allow JPS to pay a bill that is incurred. You know, just like any business, when you have to buy raw materials and you have to buy inputs to produce a product or a service that you sell, just like any other business, when there's an increased cost, like a bakery, you have to, the price of flour or sugar goes up and you bake it in making bread it's reflected in the price of the product right so it's not like a JPS
