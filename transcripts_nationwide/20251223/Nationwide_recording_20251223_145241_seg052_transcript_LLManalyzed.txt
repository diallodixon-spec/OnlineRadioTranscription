We war on him left and no come back till late in the hours with a bunch of the nicest flowers. Even though me fake still me blood a boil. One look but one humble like a child can't help it me couldn't hide the feeling. Plus him a thrill me with the most sweet talking. You know me not gonna knock you down baby. Down me just won't hold you down baby.
