When I accosted the man, the child was terrified. She was very frightened. And when I held on to both of them, she said to my wife, he took me away and he took my tire and my watch. That's what the child said, with a very tear crying voice and stuff, very scared. I was, as a parent, I was very angry, to be honest with you. This man couldn't escape me at all, you know, the way I hold hell down to him. You know, I said, no, man, you're not going anywhere to the bathroom. Not at all, not at all. Right, so. Correl him good and proper. Yes man, yes man, yes man. Yes. I said, my wife took the child and placed her in the car, so she was in the car with my six year old daughter and you know, my daughter was there based on what my wife told me and comforting her and they were sure spread for the little girl at the same time. And I think there was a teacher from the school came on the scene with the police, they went by the vehicle and you know, the police went over.
