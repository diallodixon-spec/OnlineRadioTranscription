20251231 141711 I want to tell you this, baby. This heart's been mistreated. Yes, you really did mislead it. Made the tears feel mine. It's been torn apart from the start, and baby, on top of that, you totally lost. So if you've got a mind to break my heart You're too late because there's already too much So be gentle now Be gentle now And boy if you wanna leave me ahead
