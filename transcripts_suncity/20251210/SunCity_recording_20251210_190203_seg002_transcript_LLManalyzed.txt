I'm not going to be able to play tonight though my brother. I'm not gonna be able to play that song tonight and if I play that song, certain people are going to get emotional and I don't really want people to get emotional in the night. But I can play it next week. Next week I'll definitely play it. So he was asking for the Turbulence dub for Mama Bee. He wanted to hear that. That song is not a reggae song so I wouldn't be able to play it today. Plus, I don't feel like I'm making anybody get emotional right now because Mama Bee is missed. We miss her like crazy, so I don't really want to play it and make anybody just start crying and get sad. Today is Mama Bee's day.
