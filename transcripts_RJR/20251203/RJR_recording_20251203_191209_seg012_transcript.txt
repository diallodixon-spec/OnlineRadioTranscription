that the music started to kick off. That's when I was really, really, actually through the gate. So I had to do a lot of back and forth. And at the time, I was able to get an internship with the New York State Assembly. So, I had to go back and forth from the internship side to where the studio was, to where the studio is. And, you know, if I had to take a flight, I had to leave from up there and it's probably about a three hour drive, three and a half hours, so it was definitely hectic. The test date, I had moved it to around, I think, was it January, February, I can't remember. However, I was on the trip back to the testing site. I decided let me use the testing site this trip because I know my webcam isn't working. Now on my way there, the train stops at the time. I was on the Amtrak. The train stops and they tell all the passengers that we have to wait. The train can't progress any further.
