**Interview with Bijan: Culture Works Season Two**

In a recent interview on Roots FM 96.1, Bijan, a music teacher, recording artist, and owner of High Point Band, discussed the upcoming Culture Works Season Two. The event, which launches this Friday at Skyline Levels, aims to promote authentic reggae music and support local creatives.

Bijan expressed his excitement about the event, stating that it will feature a range of artists, including Carbon, Raya, and OJ the Great. He emphasized the importance of educating the younger generation about the writers of iconic reggae songs, citing Bob Andy as an example. Bijan also highlighted the need to support conscious lyrics in music, which he believes is essential for keeping people in tune with what's happening in Jamaica and worldwide.

The conversation also touched on the recent hurricane that hit Jamaica, with Bijan noting that the event's timing is perfect for promoting positivity and resilience. He mentioned that Chronic's new album, "Exile," was released at the right time, providing a much-needed boost to the community.

Bijan will be performing at the Kingston Creative Festival this Sunday, and he encouraged listeners to support the event and the local music scene. The interview ended with a reminder that Culture Works Season Two will continue into February, with a focus on Black History Month and Reggae Month.
