20251224 130503 I am coming out of the streets, Simon. I went to the market on Saturday, and I went today in Spanish Town. Went in the supermarket. And when you see what Jamaicans are in Christmas, what they are putting on their trolley, what they are cashing out. You have the chicken chassis, the one where they cut off the breast and the leg and all them stuff. Three of them, I see the people are cashing them, Charlie. It's Christmas, and you know, it's Christmas, most people like to buy one piece of ham and all them type of things. The people, they don't have the money to buy nothing, Simon. Jamaicans are suffering. And with these state agencies are telling us how well things are, that employment, how can an employment rate at three percent, even lower than the United States of America, and people can't, people don't have money to buy nothing at all, Simon. How can that be?
