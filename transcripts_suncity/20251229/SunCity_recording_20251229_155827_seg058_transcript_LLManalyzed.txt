20251229 155827 Hey, shout out to Richie. Got it locked in over there in Maryland. Richie says it's 50 degrees. Good weather, but it's 50 miles per hour wind, so it's kind of chilly. That don't sound like it kind of chilly, my brother. That sound rough. Well, well, well, well well, well cold. Hey shout out toma, got it locked in. Baby, come to me, be my lady. I'll show you things you've never seen. Oh, baby. Come to me, girl, can't you see?
