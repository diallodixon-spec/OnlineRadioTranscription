20251229 204122 It's a heartache Nothing but a heartache Hits you when it's too late Hits you when you're down It's a fool's game Nothing but a fool's game Standing in the cold rain Feeling like a clown It's a heartache Nothing but a heartache Love until your arms break Then he lets you down It ain't right with love to share When you find he doesn't care for you
