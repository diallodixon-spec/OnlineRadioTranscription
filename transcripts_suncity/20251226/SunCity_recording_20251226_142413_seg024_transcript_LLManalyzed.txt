20251226 142413 I am fine I'm not afraid of feelings I'm not scared of my things I'm not just a boy because they advertise my drinks And if I'm not rich I'm not going to run your paper I don't want to be a lynx Because I'm going off the road If I can't buy a cliff, much less buy a drink Never grow off the road Let's go! Let's go! They never tell you before, it's a pressure bus type. Pick up your car, manage your own flight. Better yourself for the consequence, cause you love hype. Atchoo, me stayin' on me own, and lean on me own. And games on the bike and style, do it. Stayin' on my own, and leaning on my own. And games and the bike and style do it.
