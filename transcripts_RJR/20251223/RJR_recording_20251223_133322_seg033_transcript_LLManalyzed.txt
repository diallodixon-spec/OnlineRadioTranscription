20251223 133322 Last year, I got a Santa suit. What? Full suit? Full suit, yeah. And I tried on the suit. But it's like, the suit, I support my size, but it's large. And I said, no, I'm not a Santa suit, but I'm going to size down. It's a slim Santa suit, them guys? Slim Santa suit, me get the only part. The only part where we can kind of even clock was the belly part. My foot couldn't go through the part. So yeah, mm-hmm. I tell him say eh-eh. Clear this was evidence that I shouldn't be Santa. That's so funny. Yeah, I tell you man. No sir. Yeah, we're gonna just wrap up in a sheet and say ah Joseph for the part of Christmas. He'll stick to leave out Santa. Listen, the way we are so happy, I'm sure there are four deserving residents from Clarendon who are even happier. They're proud owners just in time for Christmas.
