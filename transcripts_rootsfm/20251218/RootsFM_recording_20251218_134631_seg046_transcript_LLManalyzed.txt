20251218 134631 Should have known better on a cheater plan The waste of chance that I've been given So I'm never gonna dance again The way I mess with you Put up, put up, put up! As I take your hands And lead you to the dance floor As the music dies Something in your eyes Caused a minor silver streak And now it's said goodbye I'm never gonna dance again
