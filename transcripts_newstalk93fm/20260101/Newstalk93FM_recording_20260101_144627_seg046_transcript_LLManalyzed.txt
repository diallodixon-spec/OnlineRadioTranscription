20260101 144627 When I left school, I lost track of you Abigail called me with the bad news, goodbye And we'll never know why It was not an invitation But I flew home anyway With so much left to say It was no way Convenient, no But I whispered at the grave Should've kissed you anyway And it was not an imitation Should've kissed you anyway, should've kissed you any way, any when it was not. My advice is always ruin the friendship, better than regret it for all time. Should've kissed you anyway.
