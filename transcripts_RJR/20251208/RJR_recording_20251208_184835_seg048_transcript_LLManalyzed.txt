The Reggae Boys can still get a chance to go to next year's Summer Showpiece with victories over New Caledonia and DR Congo in the first game of a double header at the Stadium East complex. At-Chat, James Doblev put them in firm control with James scoring in the 56th and 71st minutes. Jerome McClary had put Cavalier ahead in minute 34. Meanwhile, in the late kickoff, Tivoli Gardens will battle Waterhouse at 7.30. Further afield now as Bruno Fernandes' brace helped Manchester United get back to winning ways as Rock Bottom Wolves' wretched campaign continued with a 4-1 loss at the Molyneux on Monday. Fernandes put the visitors into a deserved lead after 25 minutes.
