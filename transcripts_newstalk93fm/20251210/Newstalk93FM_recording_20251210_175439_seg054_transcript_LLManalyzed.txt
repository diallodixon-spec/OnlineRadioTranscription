No matter where it cost me, because me love her so much much So me treat her with such tenderness, she and me baby Cause I believe that love is a powerful thing I'm feeling deep within And if you believe in love Free up your mind Play me slow within As early as the morning star I'm giving thanks For this lovely. And if I ever dream me a dream, I won't wake up because you're still holding on. And no other girl can hold me hold me hold me so tight yet, baby. None of them ever please me, sir, treat me so well.
