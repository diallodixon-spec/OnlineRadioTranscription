I'm staying all evening. Staying under you. Baby, I'm staying under you. I'm sticking around as long as I breathe it. You know I'm not leaving. Staying under You. Baby, I stay under you. Magnet. I pull it you close, you pull it me close, we're coming in closer Magnet, my girl you a body, you a body with a body on your back sir Anytime you call me I answer My girl you a body you a body on your back, sir. Anytime you call me, I answer. Cause you bought a wine, I call it a thievin'. I stay alone in hell. Stay come to you. Baby, I stay come to you. I stay in the frown, that's all.
