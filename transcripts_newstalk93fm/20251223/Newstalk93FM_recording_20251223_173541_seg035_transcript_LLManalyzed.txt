20251223 173541 I'm not coming up tonight I'm drunk in the party So I don't think no self-party can find me I was clapped by the melodies Now the liquor take all of me And the bass knock my soul out And make sure Soka won't let me leave I don't know if I'll survive Song after song, wine after wine I go sing strong and fit for life Weak like the masses, kryptonite Now you'll find me, we're bound for shaking I am eating just the first time to free up the carnival won't let me go go send a search party to find me I'll out on the road and line it tell them that this hookah hang me you'll see me Wednesday go send a search party to Friday, I out on the road all night Tell them that this hookah hang me, you'll see me Wednesday Send a search party on Friday, I lost on the road all right Tell them that it's hookah hang me You'll see me Wednesday I'm not coming home tonight
