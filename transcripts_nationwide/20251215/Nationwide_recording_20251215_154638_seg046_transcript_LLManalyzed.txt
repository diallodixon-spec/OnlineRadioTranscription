Deja vu, this feels like Deja vu.asting and an open fire Christmas song or the original version is called Christmas song and that Nat King Cole is my favorite but guess who did a rendition of it? One of my favorite artists right now Noura Olivia Dee! She did a version of Christmas song. She's doing so great. We recently learned that she has Jamaican roots.
