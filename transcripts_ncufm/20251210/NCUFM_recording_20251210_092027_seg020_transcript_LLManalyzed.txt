There are voices that tell us we weren't even voices, but change calls us to cast them away. But change calls us that our treasures we must keep. The age that we hold, the lessons carved into us by struggle. But since change doesn't erase them, it refines them. Change doesn't erase them. Life's promises discern the difference, but it's common to pause them for cleanings, to pray before discarding them. The prayer to change is not our enemy. Change is the hand of a god rearranging our lives. The hand of god rewinding our lives. Fruit pruning and planting our seeds for tomorrow. Planting seed for tomorrow. When we resist change, we resist gross change. When we welcome it to gross, we welcome when God is acclimating. We welcome when God is timing. Open the box, it's time to begin.
