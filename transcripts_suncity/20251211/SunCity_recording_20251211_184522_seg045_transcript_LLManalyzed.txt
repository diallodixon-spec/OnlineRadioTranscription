It's a conversation that we should have because I believe responsible use, ethical use of social media is something that we should be trumpeting not only in the higher education space, but certainly from early childhood stages and within the education sector, I believe constant and sustained digital literacy, not only digital literacy, but also digital engagement, because you would find a lot of teenagers, a lot of kids, pretty much don't go through formal training in terms of using IG, TikTok, or even YouTube.
