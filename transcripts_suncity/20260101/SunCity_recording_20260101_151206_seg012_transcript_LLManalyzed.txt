20260101 151206 so long I wish done every start you came along I knew that someday you'd walk through that door sometimes it's hard but love is worth waiting for everybody needs someone to love. Everybody wants to love someone when the nights are long and cold. Everybody needs someone's love. Nobody wants to be alone. When you need someone to hold, nobody wants to be alone. Now when you see me cry, you'll only see tears of joy in my eyes, in a world of lonely people.
