Thank you so much, Dr. Gayle, for that. We have come to the end of the program, Balancing Justice. I want to thank Ms. Shawna Trowers from the Ministry of National Security and Peace, Dr. Herbert Gayle from the Department of Social and Psychology and Social Work at UWI. We are discussing crime fighting.
