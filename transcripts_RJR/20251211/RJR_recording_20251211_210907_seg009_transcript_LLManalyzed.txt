2025-12-11 22:38:22 My only December wish is that your kiss is coming back soon. Tell me, what is Christmas without you? What's the point of snowball fights? With gingerbread and pumpkin pies? A corn was a sling ride just for two. I'll miss the dancing until dawn. The caroling, the cheerful songs. Tell me, what is Christmas without you? I'll still countin' days I can't wait to see your face You make every winter dream come true My only December wish Is that your kiss
