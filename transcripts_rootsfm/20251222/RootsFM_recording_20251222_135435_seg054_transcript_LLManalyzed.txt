20251222 135435 Hey, hey, hey, hey on this rainy Monday afternoon, what are you motivated to do? You know, a lot of people say when it's raining, they feel like they could eat more. You know what I'm saying? Yeah. What do you motivate it to do? Well, this has been Rootsology, your first edutainment classroom on air anywhere in the hemisphere. And it's been with your C.G. Yerkegeva, Denise Isis Isis Isis Melisumsa Empress, Sumsa Princess, Sumsa Queen. Healing upon my lions and my lionesses in the concrete jungle. Because only the fittest of the fittest will survive in this time mentally, physically, spiritually, emotionally, musically, magically, and of course, financially, ali, ali, ali-o on this here. It's what you call a mission Monday, the 22nd day of December. Guess what?
