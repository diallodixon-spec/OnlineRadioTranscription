20251219 211416 Mayor of Black River, Richard Solomon. Good morning, gentlemen. Good morning to all your people. Good morning, sir. Good morning, my good friend, Mr. Davis. All right. Thank you so much for joining us, gentlemen. Let me start with you first, Mr. Bellinavis. Christmas celebrations in the parish. Yes. Well, you know that last night we had our grand clock writing that we have done for the last 10 years and it was quite a grand affair. And you know what we did, we brought down John Kuno again, which is a traditional Jamaican Christmas festivity and it was fantastic. They turned around there in their droves and they really enjoyed themselves and they were all scared by John Kuno. But it was great and of course they had performances from the various churches and the schools and it was a nice affair. And any other plans as it relates to Christmas celebrations going into the period? I imagine there are some of your constituents that are still recovering from Hurricane Melissa. Yes, absolutely.
