20251229 142411 I want to come to my house, and he's a wicked man, I won't say a word, yeah. Incineration, you're the ruler, and I need love on the star. Irrigation is the ultimate whenever you attack. Give sight to the blind, and make the cripple walk. Humility and tolerance, love upon the heart. None of his seed shall break back on the sidewalk. Children and other parents in the light within the dark. I say again, bless the people, and the people rise. Teach the people, let the people. You can see behind the wall and I can see behind the scarf Never throw the children food in the hand they might have The fire that we burn you make you start You them want food and the cow and your grass Teach them to the wise
