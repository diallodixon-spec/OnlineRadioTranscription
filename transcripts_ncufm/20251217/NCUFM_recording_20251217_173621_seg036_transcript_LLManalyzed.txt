20251217 173621 Why is it important to pray for people who are hurting? I see one answer saying, it helps them feel better. Yes, that is true. That is true. I see an answer saying, if we pray for them, then God will do his best. I see a third answer saying, praying for people who are hurting is good because it means we will get our blessing and someone else will get theirs too. Those are some wonderful answers. I love those answers so much. And this marks the end of the Kids Zone this afternoon.
