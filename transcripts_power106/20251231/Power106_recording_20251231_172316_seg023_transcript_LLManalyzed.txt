I've seen quite a few customers come in and they don't have any jack. Some don't have a spare wheel. And if they have a spare wheel, the tire is not good. It is flat. We need to pay a little bit more attention to our vehicles to ensure that any eventuality that takes place, Shelly, we can overcome it quite easily without fear or getting flustered or anything like that. So, check your car. If you can't check it, have someone who is able to do it or your technician to do it for you. Lighting is also a critical thing, Shelley, as we mentioned before over the years. A light bulb that is about $200 can cost you about $5,000 to $10,000 a ticket.
