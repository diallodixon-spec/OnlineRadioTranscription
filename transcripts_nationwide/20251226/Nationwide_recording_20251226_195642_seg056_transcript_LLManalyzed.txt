20251226 195642 We're going to find that love as we open up the door Don't you know that we're in this love together We got the kind that brings to mind a favorite song You're all in my heart It's just the start, babe There's much more to love Than the way you're thinking now To wear my ring With something special Now you close the door The ring thrown on the floor But if that's alright with you, I won't take a second chance I don't have to take it, and you don't have to fake it anymore
