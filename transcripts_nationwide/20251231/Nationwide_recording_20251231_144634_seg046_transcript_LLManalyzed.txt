He always in the air but he never fly couchy I mean, it's no shame, I'm loving your tie You're like thicker than the guy with the- Oh, yes I did, yes I did Somebody please tell him- I am Nicki Minaj, I'm that some dudes up That coops up and drops the dudes up Well you got my heart, I feel you running away Beating like a strong man is coming your way Can't you hear me?
