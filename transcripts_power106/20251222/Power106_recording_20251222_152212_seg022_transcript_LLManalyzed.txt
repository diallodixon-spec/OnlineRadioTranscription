20251222 152212 We can actually sell properties subject to caveats. And it all depends on the type of caveats. Let me move on to the second part of the question. Is it true that JPS can have a caveat on their property? Yes. And this is very common. And no, it doesn't mean that JPS can claim the property. It doesn't mean that they can become the owner. What it means is that JPS has the right to erect poles near the property to pass power lines over the property. That's usually what JPS caveats mean. So because the JPS will have a caveats on the property, when the property is being transferred, we have to do those transfers subject to the JPS caveats. So John owned the property with the JPS caveat. He's now selling it to Shirley. Shirley has to take the property subjected to the JPS caveat. The JPS caveat is going to be a permanent fixture on the property. So yes, you can sell the property with a JPS caveat. It doesn't mean that they are going to own the property.
