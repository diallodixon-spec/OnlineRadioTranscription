============================================================

You must be mad, you must be mad mad mad mad mad You must see mad, you must see mad mad You heard me bad enough, real bad enough I'm just repairing me heart, I'm not gonna let you rip it up I see you flipping up, I hear you leaping up Better you cut because you're not disturbing peace You know I'm happy, happy Oh I feel so free, I'm feeling so happy, happy. We're done with bad company because you were seen it for love. Oh, yes, I know. You were only in it for the paper. But if you can love me now, you can love me later Only two seasons before Two seasons to let you break my heart Just as you close your door on me, I think I'll be broken
