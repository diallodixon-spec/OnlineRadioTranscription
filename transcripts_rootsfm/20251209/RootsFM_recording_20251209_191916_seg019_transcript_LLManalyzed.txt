Search all you want, you will never find A love that is purer and sweeter than my book Search all you want to just waste your time talking You coulda used that time for love, babe Trust me, I love you, no one above you I I gotta let you know, girl, you are the reason my heart is still beating. So why would I let you go? You got a chance, and you put it on me like no other girl had ever put it before. So before I go through the door, I gotta tell you for sure, you're my baby all you want you will never find A love that is purer and sweeter than mine, girl Search all you want, you're just wasting time
