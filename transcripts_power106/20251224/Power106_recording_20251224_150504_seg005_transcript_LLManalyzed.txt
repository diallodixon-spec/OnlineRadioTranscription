20251224 150504 Interesting. So Carl Rowan. I guess we have a moment in black history here. As we continue to run through or from the archives feature, Carl Rowan, the first colored diplomat to be appointed by the U.S. Department of State, was former U.S. Ambassador to Finland in Eastern Europe and was on vacation in Jamaica in December of 1965. Also, in terms of Christmas stories at the time, we always hear how much money is in circulation for Christmas. Back in 1965, according to the BOJ at the time, notes in circulation in Christmas week were to the value of 15.2 million pounds, nearly one million more than the amount that was in circulation in 1964.
