20251226 093220 us to do your will and we thank you for your blessing in Jesus's precious name amen and amen praise God hallelujah so last week we look at Zacchaeus receiving the grace of God which is the unmerited favor of God we don't deserve it he did not deserve it we don't deserve but yet still true God's unconditional hallelujah, his mercy and his grace was extended to Zacchaeus as it is extended to us all. We saw where Zacchaeus responded to that grace, hallelujah. I want to just move right down into this moment whereby we see Zacchaeus came down after he was requested by the Lord Jesus Christ to come down. It is important that we understand that we must learn to respond positively and seriously to God
