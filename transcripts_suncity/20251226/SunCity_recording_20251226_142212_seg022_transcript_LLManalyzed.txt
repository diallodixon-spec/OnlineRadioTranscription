20251226 142212 I don't understand, so we see that right and we don't need friends People on the south, I don't need them One of them attack and one of them train I want nobody else which don't need them God don't be them, you with them, what about the row with them? I feel it for a fee of $3 till I touch it around for the whole weekend Say they like me, grow me then, but I'ma drop this before me then Whether I'm out shop before me, if I can't catch bad man, don't know him then No, no, no good, young life. Yeah, yeah. Dusty, I shop for these nippets. See them gonna go on one of vibes and a remedy. But if they're on them, what do they do with it? No, no. No, I take my time from them. Some boy, we ain't no brother, much less my relative.
