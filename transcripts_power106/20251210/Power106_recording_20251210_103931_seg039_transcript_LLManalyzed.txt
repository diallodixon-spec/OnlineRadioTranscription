The bank commenced its December meeting yesterday against the backdrop of a global investor expectation of another cut in its benchmark federal funds rate to between 3.5 and 3.75 percent per annum when the meeting concludes at 2 p.m. today. Investors are also waiting with bated breath to hear what its outgoing 16th chairman, Jerome J. Powell, who will be replaced by the Donald's lackey Kevin Asset, has to say about the future of monetary policy during his last Laplace tenure, which ends in May of 2026. Many investors believe that the Donald will succeed in controlling and manipulating the Fed under Asset, and as a result, it will lose much of its vaunted credibility, and I think that is what many persons are afraid of.
