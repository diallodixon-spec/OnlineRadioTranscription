Yeah, yeah Go ahead, it's your time baby It's your time baby, get my baby That's the difference when you're my baby That's how it is when you Nobody make me stop the world So you're my third passion Maybe what you asked for So tell me if you want action Until the lights back on I got the one we gon' last long I don't even ever know my time Girl, like what I waited for lifelong I pull up in my high fashion Every night I shit in any way We can go ahead and dress it out And chill up in my villa, take it out the whole night
