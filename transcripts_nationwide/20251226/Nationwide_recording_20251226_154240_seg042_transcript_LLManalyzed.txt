20251226 154240 But still Jaja chose to remember my face So I never lived like he wanted I'm still mindful of what he taught me So now I beg and plead, I'm on my bending knees God's father you rescued me I've got the stars to show I barely made it a long life's road Cause when my life got dark he was my only spark He was up in all the towns Every time you take one step, something pulls you back But you get knocked out bitch and you fall Wicked people and bad minds, lurking in the dark But I have no fear
