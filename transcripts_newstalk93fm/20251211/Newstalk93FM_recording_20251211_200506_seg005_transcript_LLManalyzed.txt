2025-12-12 14:14:36 When I'm feeling under the weather You just make me feel sweet Ice the cocoa tea, use the sugar And together we are complete, darling Heat me up Only you alone can put fire back in my soul Heat me up And they're telling me I shouldn't leave that fire alone Well, the more they tell me, the more I hold the new clothes I could never let you go Miss Hoshiney Girl, I'm coming home, I wanna see you again All day, through the night, I dreamin' Miss Hosheney When you turn the top, make it smooth, my darling When outside is pouring rain Put a button in the fire Poppin' in your, poppin' in your Poppin' in the tuba Raise the temperature higher Comin' in your, comin' in your Comin' in the closer Make the ting get your fire Spill it all on the ground
