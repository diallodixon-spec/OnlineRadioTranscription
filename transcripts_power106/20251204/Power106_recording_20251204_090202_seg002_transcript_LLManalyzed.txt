Oh, I saw Mommy kissing, kissing. Kissing, kissing, Santa Claus. Underneath the mist so cold last night. She didn't see me creep down the stairs to have a pee. She thought that I was tucked up in my bed, gone fast asleep. Then I saw Mommy tickle, tickle. Tickle, tickle, sad applause. Underneath, his big toe stone. Why? Oh, what a rabbit would have been if they had only seen Mommy kissing Santa Claus last night.
