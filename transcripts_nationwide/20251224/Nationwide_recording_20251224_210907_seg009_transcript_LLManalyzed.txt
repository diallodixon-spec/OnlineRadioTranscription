20251224 210907 Why would I not want to be part of pushing reggae forward? No. Does that make sense? So I said to myself, I want to put together music that reminds me of the core of what Paradise Plum is about, which is femininity, boldness, as he said, spirituality, but at the same time staying true to the sound of reggae and making it my own. You know, so there's a lot of like undertones of stories that I think a lot of women and men will relate to, it's more a lot it shows like my coming of age you know as an artist and as a girl you get me and then so yeah I think there's about I think it's 11 tracks 10 or 11 because we made I've probably made like 20 songs you know what I'm saying and then we narrowed it down so I'm looking forward to people feeling that and I know I mean I've played this the project for a couple of people and some women have also like had access to the early listening and just the different the feedback I've gotten has just been wow I feel your soul here. Any collaborations on the project? Yes on the project to be honest I'm not a big like oh my god I need a collaboration
