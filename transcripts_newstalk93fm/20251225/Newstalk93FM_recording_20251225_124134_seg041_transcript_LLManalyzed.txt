20251225 124134 Come on to me, come on to me. Come on to me. This is my apology. Follow me. Come and see what you mean to all of me. You're a treasure in my eyes. The greatest pleasure in my life. So you better come through this time, please hear my cry and if I ever let you down my friend it was a misunderstanding so if I took it for granted then I promise from today I'll go jump like I never jump wait like I never wait
