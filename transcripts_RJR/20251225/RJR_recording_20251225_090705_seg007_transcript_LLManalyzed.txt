20251225 090705 You make any puncha creamer yet this year. A fee for some home in Morby. A hot cup of chocolate tea. Some Gaelic folk or local bunjee beef. I miss... Rice wine with ice. Mum jug jug nice. I miss Christmas in my land. I miss... Lake Park and Ham. Pepperpot and lamb. I miss Christmast in my land. That's right! I'm coming home for the Christmas season. Coming home for more than one reason. I'm coming to hear Christmas rooster crow in the morning. I'm coming home to see sunshine shining and to hear them church bells chiming in the sun. I'm missing Christmas in my land, that's right! I'm coming home, I'm coming home. I'm coming home I miss Christmas in my land. I miss Lloyd and Sinclair, Rudolph and Leroy. I miss Christmast in my land.
