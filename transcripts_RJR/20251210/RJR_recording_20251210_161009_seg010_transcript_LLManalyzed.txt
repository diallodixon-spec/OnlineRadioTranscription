============================================================

When I get this feeling And I wanna have a little bit of fun Try some party pleasures So glad I mentioned now I gotta run It's just you and me, love We'll stay together through the break of day Kissing and caressing, kissing and caressing me. Heated to passion, love is on the way. Oh, let me hear you say oh, oh. Baby, say oh. Oh. Let me hear you say, oh.
