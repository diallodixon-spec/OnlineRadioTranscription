20251217 102111 All day long, lost precious Been taking its toll on me I am so distressed from worrying I feel that I can be free Let me tell you what we can do to take the stress away. Tune to Sun City Radio all night and every day. Make the music catch you in a good mood. Make the music get you feeling fine. Put on dancing shoes and come with me tonight. Run all night till dawn.
