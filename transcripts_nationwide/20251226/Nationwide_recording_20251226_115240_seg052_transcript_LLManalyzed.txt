I wasn't hopelessly easy So I went down, to the spiky sea The sun was moving to me Hit the door, I had all the attention From the dance floor, to the men-o-host Out the room, men-o-ost Men-o-host, out the room Men-o-ost, out the room And they all sang the same verse Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa Whoa, whoa, Whoa, Whoa, Whoa Serious faces, it's time to get done I want to take it out, oh, oh, oh Baby, it's for them, it ain't in my arm I'm set to go over, at the look of it Turn me back, turn me back
