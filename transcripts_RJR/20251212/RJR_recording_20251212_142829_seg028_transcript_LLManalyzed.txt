2025-12-12 15:53:19 How good and great you are to me, oh father I've got to take the time to chant a prayer You've blessed my life eternally, oh grateful In the midst of enemies you keep my blade full Sometimes I fell apart, sometimes I falter And feel as though you've left me in a corner But here you are, the light upon my tomb play In the middle of the night you say you are I'm gonna make such a joyful noise So the Lord overcomes on me up here and rejoices I'm here to sing songs of praises and use up my voice In every single tune when we write so many plays
