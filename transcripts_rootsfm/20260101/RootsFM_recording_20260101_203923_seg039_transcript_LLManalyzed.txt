20260101 203923 Put your back from the impasse, pull out your freaking dress, put your freaking dress on. Put your freaking dress on, put your freaking press on. Put your freakin' dress on. Everyone may got one. Shut it down with a pow-pow-pow, pull out the big one. Put your freakin' dress on, it's an invitation When that player is on, get on up and shake it Don't get out your back, you don't have a place to hide Spin it all around then take it to the crowd Cause when it gets cold, when you put it on Get on up tight, cause you just won't get back to bed Right on your feet, right on your feet
