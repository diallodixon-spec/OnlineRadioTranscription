20251216 200404 Welcome back to my life again Oh yes, see Remember those romantic walks we used to take You held my hand in such a way my knees would shake You can't imagine just how much I've needed you I've never loved the one as I've loved you, oh friend This is where our happy ending begins And I'm sure this time that we're gonna win My heart welcomes you back home
