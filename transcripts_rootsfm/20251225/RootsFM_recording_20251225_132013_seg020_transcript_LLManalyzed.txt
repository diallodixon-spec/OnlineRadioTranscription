Oh my lord, when in the crypt they found him, Oh my lord, a golden halo crowned him Oh my lord, they gathered all around him to see him at the door Oh my lord, with the child's adoration Oh my lord, their clean, great jubilation Oh my lord, and full of admiration They realize what they have Oh my lord Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas! I am Christmas! For your Christmas this year! May the happiness you seek be forever with me!
