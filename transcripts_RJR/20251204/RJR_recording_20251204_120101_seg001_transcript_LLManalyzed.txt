Good afternoon, I'm Daydrain Gordon with the Midday News. Millions of dollars worth of Hurricane Melissa relief items destined for Jamaica were reportedly stolen in the Peel region of Toronto, Canada on Tuesday night. The shipping container had clothes, food, tools, and generators. The group of volunteers, including Jamaicans, which collected the supplies, have been left devastated. More on their support from CTV News. They have been working tirelessly for weeks and that shipping container you mentioned was just about ready to head over to Jamaica and now it's all gone. We actually was packing from here. Michael Bennett and other volunteers have been gathering donations to send to Jamaica after the country was devastated by Hurricane Melissa. But when they came to their storage facility to load a 20-foot truck this morning, everything was gone.
