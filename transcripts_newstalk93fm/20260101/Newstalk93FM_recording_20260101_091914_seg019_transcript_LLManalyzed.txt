20260101 091914 What we gonna do now? Jam to a rhythm in the heat. I can't eval, but in the heat, hey. What we go do now? Start a wine on it. I say compromise on it. Baby, spend time on it. Hey, I say compromise for me. Hey, can we talk some business? You know I want your company. And it's nothing too risky. Limited liability. Don't worry. If you try all the things I like, you could still and ride it up Just a little ride and winding out. Come and meet me in the truck and we rev it up. Say, hold it. Keep throwing it back. I know why you stopped us. Baby, no way. We got most of all the pictures you want.
