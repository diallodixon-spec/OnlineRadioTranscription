20251215 195128 $1.6 billion road program will roll out on a phased basis starting in December, with additional packages coming on stream early in the new year. The GO program will address main and heavily traveled roadways that are vital for daily commute, commerce, access to schools, health facilities, farms and town centers. Minister with Responsibility for Works Robert Morgan says the programme is designed to provide targeted fast-track interventions on services damaged while longer-term reconstruction solutions are being finalised. The programme will be led by the National Works Agency NWA and forms part of the wider Post Melissa Recovery effort which also includes medium and long-term reconstruction projects to be rolled out under other capital programs. Minister Morgan has vowed that the roadworks will be closely monitored to ensure value for money and timely delivery. Approximately $35 billion in road damage has been required.
