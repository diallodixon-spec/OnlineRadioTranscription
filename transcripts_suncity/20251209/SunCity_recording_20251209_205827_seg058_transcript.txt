Don't call me bro, me fight you are too nice, don't bring them in the news yo When they say they're real too, they only a pretend, me see them fight them real I ain't in pain, but I still make people smile Stuck in the rain, that's why nobody realises I cry Walk alone, and I stay in my lane when it's vehicle time Read between the lines, gotta show people sign Love last like Chejana easy fine i'm here wonder if smile ever hurt it love not look down yeah we are set free for a night wonder if every coin worth it why not look through it but we are set free
