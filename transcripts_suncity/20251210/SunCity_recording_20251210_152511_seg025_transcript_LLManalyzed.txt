Shout out to Umrai over there in Alberta, Canada, got it locked in. Thea McLean of the budget car rental family over by the Norman Manley International Airport got it locked in right now. Hey, Joanne, I know that you would love how I started because I played your favorite artist, Buja Banton. Big up to myself Johan in Canada, got it locked in. Got five more minutes to go before the break live in peace, their fate. Don't save him, save the future for me. Natural nature is the way to your needs. You were born as the one to conceive, now let my child eat away your grief.
