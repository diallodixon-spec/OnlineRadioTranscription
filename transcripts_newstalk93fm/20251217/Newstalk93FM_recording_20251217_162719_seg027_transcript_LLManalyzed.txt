20251217 162719 I'm in a big mood, girl, how they feel you? I know, say, your love comes passing my knee, but I still want you. I'm in a beat mood, girl, I don't want you Now only you, if it could load my back then Nobody but you Every night I go the rock here but you Baby girl we go there no solo Nobody if you tell me to leave my baby yo Bend every night if it don't to baby yo Me and you When you wake up girl you splashing on me yo Yellow like sweat all on me. Like big design, you be dripping on me. Maybe that's why I know if you live, yeah. Oh, I'm in a big mood. Call out to feel you. Something wake up, cool in my body. Tell me, what?
