the mood for for Christmas and I know it's not going to be an ordinary Christmas I'm hoping that this Christmas what you will spend your time doing normally when you when you prepare your meal for Christmas you have a coming together of the family and you always very often because we can't speak for everyone but very often we have lots of food left over and so I'm hoping that you will include in your planning some kind of outreach where you're getting food to others during that period that are not in a position to provide for themselves and for their families. The phone lines are open. Those are the numbers to call. You can also send us a WhatsApp or text message. You can follow us
