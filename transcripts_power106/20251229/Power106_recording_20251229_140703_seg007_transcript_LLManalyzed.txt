Reggae music, a player, reggae artist, a chat. I hear some me bad, I'm in a transplant. What a nice place to live. Sweet jam done, the only problem is, dollars not run. Say what a nice place we live, sweet jam done. The only problem is dollars not run. A man will live on a banana boat and he ma gone over.
