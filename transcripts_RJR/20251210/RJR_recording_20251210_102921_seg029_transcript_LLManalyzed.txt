Somebody is there, I'm trying to go, but it's just not possible because the car that I drive can't climb up on that kind of thing. but I get it and I thank you for for that perspective yeah I'm appealing I'm appealing to the emergency vehicles please we do respect there are people out there that respect emergency vehicles but please do take into consideration that you know there are just some times when the situation does not appear to be what it is.
