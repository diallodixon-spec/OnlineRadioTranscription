20251217 164834 When you speak to me, I hear a song Every word you say feels like a poem I will take you with me everywhere Listen to to you every day. Oh, oh, my sweet inspiration. When I feel like I can't do what I'm supposed to. And I can't even pick myself up out of bed. You come around with so much energy. Fill me with such melodies. Oh, my sweet motivation. When you speak to me, I hear a song. Every word you say feels like a ball.
