Human trafficking, racism, police brutality, bullying and rape, trauma, let's dance. Let your kingdom come, let your will be done in the earth Let your glory rise Let your sun shine Let it burst through the dark clouds Even through the storm and the rain We will shout Cause we know after the night Say it! We gon' be alright Hey! All things work together for good We gon' be all right Hey, I ain't worried about it Don't you worry about it I believe I'm receiving me word that he promised me We gon' be alright Oh, Jesus, we gon' be alright
