whether you think this is a good idea or another invasion of people's privacy. Australia, you know, they had talked about it. They've actually enacted the ban on social media for everyone under the age of 16. The government says the ban is aimed at protecting young people from harmful content online. You know, parents.

I get what they're trying to say.
