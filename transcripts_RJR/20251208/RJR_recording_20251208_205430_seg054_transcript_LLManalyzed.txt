============================================================

the wise men follow the star the way i follow my heart and it led me to a miracle Don't you buy me That's a Merry Merry Christmas, it's the most beautiful time of the year Lights fill the streets, spendin' so much cheer I should be playin' in the winter snow I would be under the mistletoe I don't wanna miss out on the holiday But it can't stop staring at your face I should be playing in the winter snow
