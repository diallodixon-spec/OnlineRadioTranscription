Cause I see that without you my world is just an empty place. Taking one step away from you feels like a million miles away. Cause it's a cold world when you're out there all alone. So many times I wanted to just pick up the phone and tell you, ooh, baby, baby, I miss your loving soul. But I ain't holding back no more. Because your man is coming home. And I want you to love me. Like I never loved you.
