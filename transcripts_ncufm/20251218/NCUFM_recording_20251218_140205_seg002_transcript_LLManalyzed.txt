Charlie Smith fought back bravely through Orlando Grant and Anthony Bryan, who twice pulled the game level, but Mona held firm under heavy late pressure. In the second semi-final, St. Catherine High gained revenge on Kingston College with a 3-2 victory, avenging last season's Manning Cup final defeat. Dwight Gentles scored in the 7th and 69th minutes, while Kadid Young added a goal just before half time. Casey responded through Kajay Fletcher and a late screamer from Jamal Fraser, but their rally fell short despite a missed chance in the dying moments. Mona will now chase a second Walker Cup title, while St Catherine High will be seeking their third, having lifted the trophy in 2019 and 2021.
