Take away, take away, take away yourself from trouble. Still I see light on certain countries. There's nothing no sweet like the gift of life. Walk away from trouble, stay away from strife. Life is to live through the best in life. You only live once, you're not live twice, yo. Follow the road on the righteous path. Still focus and can't just put your idea thought aside. Don't make the wicked them corrupt your heart. Do the right thing, become the one. Yes, sir, yes, sir. Take away yourself from me.
