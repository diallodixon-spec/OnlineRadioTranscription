20251216 090505 all normal at this time so sit back relax and enjoy cruising with me and the other godly seafarers on our journey I see the seafarers saying hello I don't know if you've noticed but for the entire month of December cruising has been on a theme of change and new things, new beginnings. Just a reminder that changes can happen at any time. And whatever it is, we should be willing to embrace the change. Denise Alexander is on. She says blessings to you and all the cruisers on board the SS Cruisin Bon Voyage. Indeed Bon Voyage. I receive it.
