============================================================

You carry me through streets and alleys, over hills and valleys, trot trot trotting along. And I'm still smiling, smiling, smiling, through the pain. Still smiling. Smiling. Smiling. Through the rain. I'm smiling, smiling, till I'm whole again. Sm'm still still holding on. Evil could have never make me fall in. Standing tall through and all, I'm still standing. I'm still, I'm still holding on. Evil could have never make it far. Stand the dog through it all. I'm still living the way it is. And nobody knows the pain.
