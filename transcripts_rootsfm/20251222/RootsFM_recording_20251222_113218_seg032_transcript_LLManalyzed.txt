And she'd have shared in that book 12 lessons, and we were talking about them. We may not have identified them specifically just yet, but there are 12 lessons that we can learn or we can use to help us to be guided as we study so if you're out there and you're thinking about higher education you're thinking about learning a skill you're thinking about just doing something new learning something there are some strategies that you can follow based on this book and you should go out out and get this book. In short, I'm going to ask her to share with us how you can purchase this book to have this as a part of your library. But just to share a little bit more about who our guest is today.
