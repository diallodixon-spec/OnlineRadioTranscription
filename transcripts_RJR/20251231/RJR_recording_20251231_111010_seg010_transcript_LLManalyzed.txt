20251231 111010 Now, I've also seen this posted on social media about parking at Palisaders. And this is from the Jamaica Conservatory Force that says members of the public are advised that it is illegal to park along Palisaders Road for the purpose of viewing the fireworks on Wednesday, December 31st. Absolutely no vehicle will be permitted to park on the roadway. Additionally, no parking will be allowed on the right-hand side of the road heading towards Norman Manning International Airport between 5 p.m. on Wednesday and 12.30 a.m. on Thursday. A motorist found in breach will be prosecuted and their vehicles will be towed. So I'm not seeing this now on social media and of course just taking opportunity to read this to you.
