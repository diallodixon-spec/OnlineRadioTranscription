20251218 174635 Now the weekends are spent at the beach all the riverside She's always up for the ride and she likes to be up in the hills Far away from the noise when she just wanna chill She wants to hear birds and bees when they sing, and I'm glad that she does cause it's my kind and stay. Can't wait another day. And now I don't feel so far away.
