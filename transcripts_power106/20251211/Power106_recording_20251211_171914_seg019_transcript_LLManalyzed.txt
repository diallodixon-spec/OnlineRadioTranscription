2025-12-11 18:35:59 at the University of St. Gallen in Switzerland on the matter. Let's hear what they had to say. The German industry lost tremendous market share. I think there's no other way than better electric vehicles. Germany is suffering a lot of fundamental issues over regulations, high labor costs, very high social standards. Consumers are skeptical. Politicians are skeptical because they fear the loss of jobs. It is an existential crisis. range extenders and even synthetic fuels do have a role to play in decarbonization. Andreas Herrmann joins me now from St. Gallen University. Andreas, welcome. I want to ask you upfront, could this idea to slow this march toward battery electric only vehicles actually help save the German car industry?
