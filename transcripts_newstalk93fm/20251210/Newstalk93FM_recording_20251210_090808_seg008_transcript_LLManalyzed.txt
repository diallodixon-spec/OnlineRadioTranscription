============================================================

We'll all walk hand in hand I have a dream That some way For our children this will be a better land Now maybe you can't see my me And you can't see me dreaming But I'm sure someday you'll understand It can all be better If we get it together And build a dream, dream, dream I have a dream, I have a dream Sing ity. Oh, my dream, come true. For me and for you. The dream, the impossible dream. Oh, Lukey, now.
