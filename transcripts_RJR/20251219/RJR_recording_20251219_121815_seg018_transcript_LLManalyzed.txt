20251219 121815 I just think they pretty much took a pitch from the New Zealand boys' book. It was a pretty good pitch. Outside of the oddball, probably jumping a little bit or staying down a bit. I think the guys are really positive in going about their business this evening because after a long day on the third test against England in Adelaide. Australia were 271-4 in their second innings at Stomps on Day 3 at the Adelaide Oval, an overall lead of 356 runs. Head was 142, not out, and with him at the close was Alex Carey on 52. Ousmane Kawaljam also made 40. Earlier England were dismissed for 286 in their first innings
