20251223 164322 Now I'll travel the world, see many things a lifetime could never foresee. Say I'm feeling truly grateful that this life is where I am thought to never be. I will never take the credit for what you've done because of your love and grace. Now you've given me the courage to carry on. Now I'm sure to run this race. Moving forward. Gotta look behind me. Oh, you brought me. Moving forward. Oh, gotta look behind me. Oh, la la la la. As I look back over my whole life, Lord, I wonder how you did it, why you did it. Lord, I can't stop.
