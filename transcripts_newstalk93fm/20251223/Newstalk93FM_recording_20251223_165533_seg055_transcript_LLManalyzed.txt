20251223 165533 Chicken, vegetable, all these things don't make sense because we're not going to find anything. What are you up to there mumbling Karen? Mummy, I just don't see how we're going to get all these things. I don't even think some of these things are available. Girl, put on your shoes because we're going shopping so make sure you carry the list. Mummy, look, see they have chicken so we can cross that off the list. I don't know why you doubted me that we're not going to find anything. Because the government announced just the other day that chicken is going to be available. When I hear that, I know if I even just chicken, we can do it several different ways. Well as long as it fry me good, you can keep everything else. You know your father can't eat fried chicken, so we have to bake it for him. Oh, Karen, look, they have eggs. up two or three for me. We need enough to bake the Christmas cake and then, you know. You actually plan to bake? Of course. Christmas dinner can't complete without little cake. Well, what else is on the list? Because I can't source a chicken and cake I'm going to eat. Come, make a walk.
