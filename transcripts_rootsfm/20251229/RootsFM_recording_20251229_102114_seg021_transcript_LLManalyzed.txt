20251229 102114 So another day I live, I appreciate Don't ever wanna act too high and mighty Cause tomorrow I can fall down on my face So in everything, Lord, I give you praise And that puts a smile on my face Lord, I thank you for sunshine, thank you for rain Thank you for joy, thank you for pain It's a beautiful day, yeah, it's a beautiful day. So yeah, go wa-wa through the valleys of the shadows of death. I will fear no evil won't be this.
