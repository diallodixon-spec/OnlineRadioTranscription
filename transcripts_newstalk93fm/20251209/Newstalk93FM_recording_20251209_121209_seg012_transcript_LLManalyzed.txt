============================================================

Great is gonna buy So magical It's a blessing sent from above And we could jump till morning Look, the moon's gone sleeping Tell them we're not leaving Till the last drop of Bacchanal is Madness in the capital, so I feel like I run and talk again Jump and shake the ground again Now we need time for a touch up on somebody. Hand up in the air. Madness everywhere. It isn't with DNA. So jump up, play a match.
