So come on out tonight And we'll leave the others On a ride through paradise And if you feel alright Then we can be lovers Cause I see that starlight Look in your eyes Don't you know we can be lovers cause i see that starlight in your eyes don't you know we can fly and if we stay together we'll feel the rhythm of the evening picking us up high never mind
