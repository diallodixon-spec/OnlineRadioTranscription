While you're in pain, it requires some deeper kind of trust. When you sow while you're crying, it means that you are choosing faith over your feelings. It means you're choosing obedience over getting overwhelmed, and you're choosing hope over despair. God sees that kind of faith. God honors that kind of faith, and as he promised a bountiful harvest, God will multiply it for you. Some of the greatest spiritual harvests come from seeds sown during seasons of grief and seasons of loss and seasons of disappointment and the transitions and the uncertainty. When you choose to worship through pain, pray through the confusion and obey through your discomfort. Or keep believing even with a trembling heart because you are planting in faith and God promises that none of those seeds will be wasted but your time family we know they have the reaping and the bountiful harvest it may not come immediately but the joy may not come overnight
