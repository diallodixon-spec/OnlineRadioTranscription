Jerry Rice, one of the greatest wide receivers and an NFL legend. Today, I'll do what others won't. So tomorrow, I can achieve what others can't. Jerry Rice, the greatest wide receiver and NFL legend. Reminder, stay disciplined today. The extra effort you put in now becomes the advantage you enjoy tomorrow. Certainly very wise words indeed. That's our program for today. Certainly hope you enjoyed it as much as we did enjoy bringing it to you from this side of the microphone. My name is Pip Williams. Alright, right. He's the producer of the show, David Thomas, a very able technical man on duty once again. And this team is inviting you to join us tomorrow because really we will endeavor to present yet another version of Togo Player Mondays to Fridays from 6 to 8 p.m. on the station for 106 FM. All right, music on it today. We have you joining Sparks. You will hear what I hear, followed by the Temptation version.
