20260101 163523 I put a smile on my face If I said you can never face And if you don't know me well, well, well You won't see how buried I am inside my grave Inside my grave Cause you see people, people,, people Don't really know you They don't really know you I've been drinking more All for the past five days Did you check on me? Now did you look for me? I walked in the room, eyes are red and I don't smoke banger Did you check on, did you check on me, now did you notice me? Oh, holy fire
