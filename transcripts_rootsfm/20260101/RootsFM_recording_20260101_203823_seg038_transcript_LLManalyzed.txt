Get him up high, this is your song Roll out your back, I'm the impact Roll out your break, come back Put freaking breathe on. Every woman got fun. Turn it down when it's all gone. Pull out the big gun. And put your freaking breath on, so when you call me, turn off my hot address, let's get it right. Short and backless. See you messin' the way in the moonlight. Such an attraction. You tellin' me how my outfit's so nice Little heat, huh, my man won't take it off tonight It's when the ex comes, it's when you put it on Feelin' my vibe, this is the song
