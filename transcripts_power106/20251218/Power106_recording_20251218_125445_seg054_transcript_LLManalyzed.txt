20251218 125445 and this is where I always thought RADA played a significant role. The danger is that everybody in trying to get back cash flow and get back on their feet would then turn to those crops which would then lead to a glut in the market because you have cucumber growing out your ears because everybody is growing it. RADA, when I remember RADA starting, it was to advise Farmer Joe over on the left side of the island not to grow what farmer Mark is growing on the right side. So you get a diversity of crops and farming and so on. How does Radock then advise these farmers? This thing don't make sense everybody grow tomato otherwise the price going plummet and you're not going to make the money. How do you fulfil that role at a time like this? Alright, very good question. Rather have extension officers spread out across the length and breadth of the island. How many extension officers?
