20251226 215234 That's my word, if you made fun of it, don't fret, panic, I'm gonna make you fly just like birds. I make you wiggle with the thing, I make you jiggle with the thing. Move up your body and I swing, I am the king for your world. So the bubble what you bring, it just makes me rise in it, it's tantalizing, come make me seal it, girl. Come on, love, it don't cost a limit, girl. So don't flop, it left me out in the dirt. You know I'm the man figure with it, girl. Now, boy, why not spit it, girl? Come give me life, and I'll change yours. Girl, who needs signs? I'll say flow rate. On the high way we loaded. Girl, if you want it, make me load it. Oh, hey, you heard me.
