2025-12-12 00:05:59 You're a diamond in love for me. Oh, it keeps me strong. It keeps me holding on from beginning to end. 365 days of the year. I want your same old love, babe. And all I want to do is share my life with you. I want you to say you love. It's lonely, lonely, all that's forsaken. A lot of love we're making, cause it's true.
