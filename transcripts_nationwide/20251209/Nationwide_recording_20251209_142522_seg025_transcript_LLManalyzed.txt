============================================================

New beginning, hello I speak my words but with a pen All of the thoughts and sentiments that live inside my head I gave my order, you fell in the deep end You came into my life while I was sinking I've been on that type of time with demons All the time I was outside, I was creepin' It was love at first, that girl when you walked in Couldn't look deep in your eyes cause I get locked in You was hurtin' deep inside and you was broken But I was on the other side and didn't notice I won't waste no time, I won't waste my time
