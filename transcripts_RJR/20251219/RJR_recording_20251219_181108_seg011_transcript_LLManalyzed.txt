20251219 181108 You're listening to Beyond the Headlines with Dionne Jackson Miller. Thank you so much for staying with us. We continue with you on Beyond the Headlines. I'm Dionne Jackson Miller, so we've been talking about using schools as shelters after natural disasters. This against the background, especially of what has been happening at Petersfield High School in West Milan. School hasn't reopened yet and all schools, the ministry wants to see them reopen in January. I know all of us want to see the kids back in school. The residents have been objecting to the plans that have been shared with them to have them relocated to tents on a playing field nearby. Now we have read a couple comments from our whatsapp line 2540693
