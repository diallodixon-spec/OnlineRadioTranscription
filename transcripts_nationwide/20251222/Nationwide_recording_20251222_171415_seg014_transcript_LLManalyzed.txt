A psychiatric evaluation was also ordered when he appeared before the Clarendon Parish Court last Thursday. Mackenzie has been charged with abduction, assault occasioning actual bodily harm, larceny from the person, among other serious crimes. Reports are that on December 9, Mackenzie went to the child's school, took her by the hand, and led her away. The matter was reported to the police and an Nanda alert issued. Upon reaching the Bustamante Highway, Mackenzie was intercepted by councillor for the Hayes Division, Cian Barnswell and his wife. The pair recognised the girl, the young girl rather, from a picture that was circulating in a community group chat.
