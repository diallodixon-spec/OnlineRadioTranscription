20260101 162221 Jesus, you love me too much, oh. Too much, oh, too much, oh, excess love. I've been buckling a number of sickness since 2025 and I'm not working and I've not one night to ever go to my bed without doing the tea, lunch and dinner. That is so awesome. Please pray for me while I I prefer you. Jesus, you love me oh, that you gave your life for me. What matter of love is this?
