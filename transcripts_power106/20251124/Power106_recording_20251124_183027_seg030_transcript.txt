Following the passage of Hurricane Melissa, Jamaicans are urged to take precautions to prevent Leptospirosis, a disease spread through contact with water, soil or food contaminated that may have resulted from flooding. Avoid consuming food that may have been contaminated with flood water or animal urine. Wear protective clothing and footwear when working or walking in areas that may be contaminated. And visit the nearest health center immediately if you experience fever, chills, muscle pain, or other flu-like symptoms.
