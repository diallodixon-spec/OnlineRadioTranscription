20251231 131110 TfM Like it's no point hoping at all Baby, baby, I feel crazy All night, all night and every day Give me something, but you say nothing What has happened in the night? I don't wanna live forever Cause I know I've been living in vain And I don't wanna fit wherever I just wanna keep calling your name Until you come back home I just wanna live forever
