20251217 135236 I must be alive for future generations If we could find a way to preserve our faith Some those who follow us see the price that was paid Then maybe when they question what it's gonna take to survive So I won't bend and I won't break And I don't want to die my way I won't stop a man in a world of desperation What has been I cannot change But for tomorrow
