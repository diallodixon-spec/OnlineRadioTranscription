Baby, you're all that I want You're lying here in my arms Pointing it hard to believe We're in heaven Love is all that I need And I found it there in your heart It isn't too hard to see We're in heaven I've been waiting for But love to come alone Now our dreams are coming true Through the good times and the bad I'll be standing there by you
