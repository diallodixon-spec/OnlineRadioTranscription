20251231 140607 Number 106. Year's end is neither an end, neither an end, nor a beginning, but a going on. With all the wisdom that experience can instill in us. Cheers to a new year and another chance for us to get it right. Tomorrow is the first blank page of a 365 page book. Write a good one. Everybody has difficult years, but a lot of times, the difficult years end up being the greatest years of your whole entire life, if you survive them. The year end brings no greater pleasure than the opportunity to express to you all the very best. May your holidays and New Year be filled with joy.
