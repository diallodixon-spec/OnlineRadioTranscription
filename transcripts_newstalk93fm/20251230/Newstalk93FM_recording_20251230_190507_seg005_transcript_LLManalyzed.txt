20251230 190507 When the world's driving me crazy Earth is shaking at my feet Feel a weight upon my shoulder You're my rescue, you're my remedy Everything about you frees me. I relax and take it easy. Cause you give me hope, hope. You're like the morning sun and I'm not alone. You give me hope. Hope. You're like the sunrise. No, I'm not afraid. Cause you give me hope when I walk on sinking sand.
