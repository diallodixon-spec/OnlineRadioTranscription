============================================================

I will be there Doesn't matter where, no where I will be there Say you can call anytime you need Now don't the lover, we have it real. I know my dark seasons change. My daughter talks with all the rage. I didn't know my dark marks time pass. But keep you closest to my heart. And when your life get lonely, please don't say you can't phone me. And if you ever need me, tell me you never need me. I will be there. Always be there.
