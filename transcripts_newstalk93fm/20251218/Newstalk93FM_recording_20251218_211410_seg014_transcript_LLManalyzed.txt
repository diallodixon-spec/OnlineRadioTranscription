20251218 211410 I have a lightning spirit Early in the morning I hat it Me cooler ready Me heist done ready Me punching that's automatic I have a lightning jumbie A kind of energy inside me And it ready for the rum Ready ready for the rum, ready ready for the rum ready for the action A spiritual encounter In me soul taking over Telling me to start up me drinking And do away with good behaviour So let we go, let we go down the road Let we go, it's action time Let we go, It's back on our time Let we go Hands up This sweating spirit havin' me feelin' good.
