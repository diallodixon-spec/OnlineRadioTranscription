20260102 213227 I'm talking. your lawn now, I'll show you on my car now. I don't need a rich bitch to somebody that can make me feel safe. Yeah, look, I don't want a couple, but nobody ever made me feel safe like you. Because when I'm with you, I just know I'm fine, know I'm fine. You take all the pressure off my mind Patient in time will not be going out my mind Safe from the problems I don't worry cause I'm hard to find Safe like I just ran a slit across the plate Safe like we playing tag in your home base
