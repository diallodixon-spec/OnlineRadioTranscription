20251223 131107 I wanna fly This is the sky I wanna fly You know I like to make you jump, jump, jump You know I like make you bump, bump, bump Like my body on a tongue, tongue, tongue And you make me wanna choke, choke, choke And if you get this on then go man, jump back Go man, jump knees, baby, shake it to the max Baby, did you please tell? I'll be based to the max Please just rewind, let me shake it it to the max Baby, did you please turn up your bass to the max? Please just rewind, let me show you to the max Young at the fear, number one in command A game just to kill me and two militants They won't figure it out, but I don't need a man Still, they love how me wine and me true religion You dealing with the body, of course Or you dealing with the boss?
