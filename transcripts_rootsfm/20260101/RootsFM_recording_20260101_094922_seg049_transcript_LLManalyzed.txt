20260101 094922 I just don't know who you are Turn the music up in here I still hear her loud and clear Like she's right there in my ear Telling me that she wants to own me To control me come closer come closer and i just can't pull myself away from the respect i can't break i just can't stop i just can't i just can't stop, I just can't stop I can't stop I just can't I just can't breathe myself no way But I don't want to escape I can't stop
