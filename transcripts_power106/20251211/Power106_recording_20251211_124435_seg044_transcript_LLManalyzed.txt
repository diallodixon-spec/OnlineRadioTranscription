Got a message here that says 106 FM is calling for the extension of the JPS license. Not to show that that's entirely true. The logic is that the IDB financing cannot be approved without it. However, last year, as you know, with explicit recognition of the impending expiration of the license, IDB Invest arranged for $150 million in financing for JPSCO. This fact is not aligned with your logic, however I have not heard it mentioned on your program. Clearly the analysis of how the IDB takes decisions requires a bit more investigation. Indeed. Alright, let's take a break. The time on Power 106 FM is 12.45. Real Business. Appointment radio for everything economics. Locally, regionally and internationally. Real Business.
