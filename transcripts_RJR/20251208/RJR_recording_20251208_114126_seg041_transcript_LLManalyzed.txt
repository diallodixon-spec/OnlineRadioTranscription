So, where do I stand in this now, Mr. Mullins? Where do I stand? You have a case, you can show that. Are you in occupation of your land for how long? Hello? I don't know what is happening. Hello? I think I've lost him, if he's still listening, I don't know why I'm getting no feedback. Maybe the land is still open, I'm not hearing him, though. So, you know, the challenge is that sometimes uptames with the system, especially after Melissa. But if you are hearing me, sir, you've done the right thing to go to your lawyer, because the transfer of land must be by deed. Yes, you have paid and you have your documentation, so you have everything. So it seems to me you are standing on good ground and you have been in possession. Did you say, well, was it 15 years? Can't recall that. But anyhow, there are things that are set out in law that you can rely on. So talk to your lawyer
