That's Inflation Watch, looking at factors influencing price changes in the Jamaican economy, right here on Radio Jamaica 94 FM, every last Thursday at 12 20 p.m. Brought to you by Bank of Jamaica. I love to see my people living in love I hate to see them fighting and swimming in blood Who does it but? Oh, them fill the earth with peas and church and whorehouse. Love the rum bar, yet them eat the pure house. Them take the Michael chip and overwrought go pour out. Less food, more chow and more mouth. Rasta tell them all the wine. Stop war and go till the sun. Stop fighting for land and all.
