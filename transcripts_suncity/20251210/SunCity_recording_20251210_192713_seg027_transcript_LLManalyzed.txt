============================================================

Your mercies flow like a river, why? And healing comes from your hands. Yes, my Jesus. Suffering children are safe in your arms. There is none like you, none like you. There is none like You, Lord. No one else can touch my heart. I can search eternity, Lord. There is no like you. Every knee shall bow when we come confess that Jesus is the best and every other God. Never ready yet. The alpha, omega, beginning and ending. Anyone the world will know he's my forever friend.
