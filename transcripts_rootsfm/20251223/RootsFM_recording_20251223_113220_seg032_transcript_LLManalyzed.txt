20251223 113220 So we need to incorporate things that match up to who we are and who we stand for. We have our Kwanzaa celebrations that start on the 26th as well, too. People are entitled to do what they want to do, but, you know, we need the children to get a fuller understanding as to what is our culture, our thing. So I have Shaya Roots on the phone line. You know, she's another very consistent listener for the past couple of years now, after she came back from the States and she's been listening. So we welcome her to hear her perspective on what she's going to eat and what what she's gonna do for Kwanzaa and so forth. Greetings Shia! Greetings, greetings my love. How are you doing? I am well if you are well my sister that's what you always say. Right and I am well so you are indeed well.
