20251222 145225 I've got him on my mind. When you hear me shouting, I've got Jesus on my mind. I will follow Jesus. Anywhere, everywhere, I will follow him. I will follow Jesus. Anywhere he leads me I will follow on. Down in the valley with my saviour I will go. Where the streams are flowing on the deep waters flow. Anywhere he leaves me I will follow, follow on. Satan cannot tempt me while my Lord is there follow follow I will follow Jesus anywhere everywhere I will follow him
