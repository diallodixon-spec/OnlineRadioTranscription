And tell me what's so special about your Christmas cake, alright? 876-254-0693, 876-255-0693, give us your first name, give us your general location. I think I bake one year. I bake one year, but I don't know how much years ago and I was like, alright. I think it's way easier to go up to the library to Angie and say, Angie baked me another two cakes when we can't get them. That worked for me so much better. I say, Angie get ready to do a thing. So message me and tell me about your baking. Those of you who are bakers and those of you who are not. Later I'll tell you about my grandmother though. My grandmother was a baker. Listen to me now.
