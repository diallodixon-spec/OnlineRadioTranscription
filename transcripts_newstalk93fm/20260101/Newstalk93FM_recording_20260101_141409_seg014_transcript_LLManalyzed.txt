20260101 141409 Let you down again I'm sorry Tell you I'm sorry I feel your frequency from miles away. You come alive with one wine, baby. With you, I want to dance the night away One jump and a lifetime baby So don't feel away You don't like the fast life I look on the bright side I go take the blame
