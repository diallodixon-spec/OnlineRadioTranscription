============================================================

You better tell, I'll treat you well I will, It's good I can tell, come give me hell, come here. Your favorite tale under your spell, I am. She gets your nail, I'll wear it all. I guess I done ran out of options. Can't keep fantasizing. I'm calling you so we can lock in But you call me toxic You make it easy for me to believe in your loving You better believe it cause baby I'm leaving with something That's better than the dick you had before
