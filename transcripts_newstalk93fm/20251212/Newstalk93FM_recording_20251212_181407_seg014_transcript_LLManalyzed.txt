We're sorry And we need you back and we're high I need you back, I'm back home Come home to me, come home to me Come home to me I, I need time, no place to go Come home to me, come on to me Come on to me I won't cry First time I touch this stage This make me feel alive I want to touch this stage I won't cry You know what I'm saying
