Just put your hands together when the music starts. Shake it up tonight, ooh. Show you how to party right. Yeah! Shake it up tonight. Move your body left and right. Shake it up, shake it up tonight. Ooh. Show you how party right. Shake it down tonight. Oh, dance the night away. Shake my body up and down tonight. Shake the time around.
