2025-12-12 10:37:12 Greetings and salutations. This morning we are live at the Spectrum Management Authority 13-19 Harbour Street in downtown Kingston for Unity United City. It's a warm sunny morning here and conditions are looking good for anyone making their way downtown. Skies are clear, there are barely any clouds in the sky and you can hear in my background there's a little hustle and bustle that's because the traffic is moving steadily those drivers should be aware that the one-way traffic and the flow changes that were put in place recently for the downtown area and they are still active this season. For those coming from areas like Halfway Tree, motorists sometimes experience heavier congestion during these peak hours, particularly along Hagley Park Road and Maxfield Avenue. Here on site, the entire, well, most the entire Roots family is here. Isis is here, String is here.
