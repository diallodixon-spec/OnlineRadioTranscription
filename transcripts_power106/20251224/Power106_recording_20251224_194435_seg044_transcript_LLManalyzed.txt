20251224 194435 to Restricted Allowance 4 on Friday. I'm expecting this feed of spells dedicated by Princess Fianni coming towards the main post. But Bobby 2 Bad, lost by a neck on the last occasion, continues to show improved form. And then there is number 8, Noble Sovereign, also likely to run very well. There's an interesting entry here as well. Number 3, Crypto Girl, back to form, happened in second to be into reality over this trade course. We'll get the six points out of this. One on the very first day, it ran, never made the frame again until the 29th of November of this year, and it's now very, very speedy. All right, so there you have it, ladies and gentlemen, your selections for tomorrow's, or rather, on Fridays. Race card, box in day, racing should be quite interesting. I'm reminding you that there'll be, it's 11 on Friday, there'll be 10 on Saturday, so 21 races for us to save.
