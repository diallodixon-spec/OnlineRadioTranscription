Okay, so this is not my first reggae song, but this is my first Reggae song as far as being released to my audience. I've always done music. It's always been a fusion of like maybe a little reggae string in there, but I've never done it full out like I'm doing right right now like the people i'm working with are people who are doing reggae before me so i'm excited nice and 2025 is wrapping up in a couple hours um what can we it's true what else can we expect
