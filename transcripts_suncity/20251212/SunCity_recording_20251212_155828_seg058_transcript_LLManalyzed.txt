20251212 155828 I'm the king of the world, I'm the queen of the town. I am the king of the city, I am the queen of the city. I am the King of the city, the king of the town. Are you ready to party? I love it in the street light zone I love it when you rub-rub-rub the beat like John I love it on the floor to the street light zone You'll never see a diddy-doddy with the street light zone Me love it when you shine like the street light zone When you're mixed, I know you'll get the street light zone But please, my dear, if you're not wild, I'll let you know that I can't sell the G mic on Ah-ah-ah, right now, what you think me right now? Take off the roll and drop it for me right now You're a king, but we're trouble-free
