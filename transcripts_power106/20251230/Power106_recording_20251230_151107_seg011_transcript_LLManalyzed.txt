20251230 151107 last year I voted for Ms. Stefina Edwards, that's Ms. St. Thomas Festival Queen and Ms. Shahida Grant, Ms. St. Catherine Festival Queen. So those two ladies I have who were fully committed to be a part of the organization. So I decided that, listen, if I can't get the Festival Queen, there must be a way that I'm able to get other contestants or other persons to be interested. And so Gabrielle Panton, who is executive and director for St Anne, we started putting out ads on social media and then people started calling us. And so that's how we arrived to where we are today to be crowning the first ever Minamist Jamaica Heritage Queen in December. In December, the competition culminates and I would imagine that you have training sessions going on with the young ladies.
