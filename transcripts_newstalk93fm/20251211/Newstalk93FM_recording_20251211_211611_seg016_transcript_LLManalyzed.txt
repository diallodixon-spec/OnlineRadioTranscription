2025-12-12 15:34:25 I have a line in spirit Early in the morning I hat it Me cooler ready, me heist done ready Me punching that's automatic I have a lining jumbie A kind of energy inside me And it ready for the rum Ready, ready for the rum, Ready, ready, for the rum Ready for the action A spiritual encounter In me soul taking over Telling me to start up me drinking And do away with good behaviour So let we go Let we go down the road Let we go It's action time, let we go It's bacchanal time, here we go! Hands up! This vetting spirit havin' me feelin' good!
