20260102 162015 New style! What's this? Oh, not that good. Yo, here's a new style, a new dance, a lick. In your hand, in your dick, here, then you rock, then you dip. Move to the drum and make it by the kick. Step forward and come up a quick, that's all the new style. Where the one place I do rap, boogal, dance, and music, sweet. Yo, boogal around the place, tight and neat. So just rap, boogle, dance, on my own tune and play.
