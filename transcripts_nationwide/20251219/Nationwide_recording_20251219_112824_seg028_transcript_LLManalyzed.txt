20251219 112824 Oh yeah, you have no idea. The stories upon stories upon stories. Can one company be so inefficient and still in business? So what is the latest on it now? It's still not resolved? You've still not been able to open the account? No. And I'm telling you, these are the documents I've sent. My driver's license, my passport, utility bill, my pay stub at TRN. And they are all notarized. This is frustrating. And you still have not been able to open. So you've given, you've done all of that and you've still not been able to. Right. And I have an indemnity with the company. Oh dear. That's not, that doesn't sound right though. Nora, do we know anyone at NCB that we can, that's in management, that we can put Lady Cynthia in contact with Lady Nora?
