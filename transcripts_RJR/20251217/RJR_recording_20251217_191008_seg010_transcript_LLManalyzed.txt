20251217 191008 and so on. So at the time we had Mr. Bernard at Montgomery High, teaching physics. So I reached out to him to find out if I could do the physics with a 6-1 class. And he said no problem. He would set up the experiment for me and so on so I can apply to the school, which is what I did. When it came to the exam time, because that was the same time that the university had their exam, I went to the teachers, to my chemistry teacher, my zoology teacher, my math teacher, and you know, what if I have a clash with the physics? If the physics exam for me levels is the same date, same time as one of your exams and the zoology and the chemistry lecturer says they can't do anything about it, I will be on my own. I have to decide what I want. For the Math class, I was on top of the Math class. I really was at UWE, outstanding, and the head of the department, when I spoke to him, he said, oh, we worked something out for you.
