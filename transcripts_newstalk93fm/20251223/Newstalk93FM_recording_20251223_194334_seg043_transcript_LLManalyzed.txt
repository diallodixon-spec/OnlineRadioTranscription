20251223 194334 Hey, can we talk some business? You know, I want your company. And it's nothing too risky. Limited liability. Don't worry. If you try all the things I like You could still be shy in the morning So don't feel away You don't like the fast life But look on the bright side girl I go take the blame I just want you come and rise it up. Just a little winding out. Come and meet me behind the truck, and we rev it up. Say, hold it. Keep throwing it back. I know why you stopped us. Baby, no way. We could pose for the picture.
