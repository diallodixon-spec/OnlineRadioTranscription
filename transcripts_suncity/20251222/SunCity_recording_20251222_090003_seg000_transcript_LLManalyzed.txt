20251222 090003 I was surviving on like three plus hours worth of sleep. Y'all made me feel good this morning. I'm not gonna lie. That was fun, guys. Raven messaged me yesterday morning, Dee. Okay, yes. At six o'clock in the morning. Alright. As a voice note. Right. Six in the morning. It's like, what could Raven possibly say at six in the morning? I am, when I open the voice I'm supposed to hear, yo, hurry and get ready. This is related to a topic we spoke about should i run but i can't even walk without you holding my we're talking about on a sunday morning
