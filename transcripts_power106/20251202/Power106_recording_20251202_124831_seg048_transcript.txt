there in the hurricane. Okay. And I just couldn't leave because I've never seen so much destruction in all my life. When I get up the morning, it was like an atomic bomb. And people, I don't know, people expect me to find some of the answers down there. And with my technical and engineering skills, I still cannot find some of the answers. When you go to a place like Amity where the road is cut off, sometimes you wonder if the course was not deep enough. Why do you have capsize. When you go and see the type of tree, I don't know when we are going to have red food down there. I don't know, when we're going to have coconut. I have seven coconuts, bearing coconuts.
