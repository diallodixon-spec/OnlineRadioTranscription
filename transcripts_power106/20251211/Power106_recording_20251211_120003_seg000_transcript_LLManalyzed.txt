But then, you know, people change up the language in order to sound brighter. It doesn't work. I appreciate your mind at the start of the show. I like the station most of the programs, but I have to turn my volume down a lot because of the commercials, especially the ones done by the females trying too hard to sound cute while sounding ridiculous for the most part. They sound similar, spooky, smoky, twanging, and screwing up simple words like power. I cannot listen to one who does the commercial for power at all. All right. It is time for the break, time for news. We'll be back at 12.30. You're listening to Power 106 FM. The time is now 12 o'clock. News. Comprehensive. Powerful. Powerful and credible. Power 106 FM now presents a simulcast of Radio Jamaica's News at Noon. Badfield Hospitals are scheduled to wind up operations in January, with at least one having already concluded its services.
