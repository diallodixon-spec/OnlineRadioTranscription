20251229 123433 buses. What number buses are these, huh? We run up there. You are seventy-seven, you are sixty-one. You are sixty-six. Sixty-eight and seventy-eight. Five buses run up there. And these buses run from where to where? From town, from town to Papin, to uh Barbican, Garden Town. So, it means that it means that the people on those routes are without service for five, five, four hours? Yes, this is what I use to tell you. When I was 61, I came to topside the bus stop. Friday, we were running up there by people. They were closing the door and driving away. Can't take no more. It's full. How do you mean when you run up there, but when the car runs up there? I tell them to walk fast. I can't walk that fast.
