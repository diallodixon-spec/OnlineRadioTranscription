We can't go forward into digitalization where we have to have a era of cables. They all can't be buried right. We do have underground infrastructure. We secure in many ways. We do have security arrangements. But we have to send a message as a country that this is zero tolerance, zero tolerance for attack on infrastructure. I'm looking at 3-2-C. I think, well, one, the penalty would be life imprisonment. But I think your suggestion for purpose-built legislation is probably the better way to go, because here you're going to have to prove that the Act was committed for some kind of purpose, religious, political, ideological purpose, objective or cause, with the intention of intimidating the public or compelling somebody to do something or not do something. I mean, I hear your argument, but again, I think the better argument is for purpose built.
