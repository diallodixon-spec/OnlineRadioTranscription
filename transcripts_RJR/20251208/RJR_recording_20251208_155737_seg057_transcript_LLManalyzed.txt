in my life right now some of the biggest things that I thought were opportunities right now I looking at them I said boy if I could go back in time I don't take that business deal because right now that that costed me an arm and a leg but maybe I wasn't prepared for it maybe I wasn't prepare for it if I were prepared if it were to come again it would be different so timing is also important timing is important sometimes the things that you praying for, you haven't gotten it as yet because that thing is being prepared for you and sometimes you are being prepared for the thing. So you have to just wait, make sure you are ready mentally before you get there. But understand that if that thing comes and you're not prepared you won't enjoy it I am yeah I said the baby you're praying for it while you are prayed do the work while you are prayed to the word because God's timing is when you are ready he will say see it yeah but do not bother make him say see it yeah
