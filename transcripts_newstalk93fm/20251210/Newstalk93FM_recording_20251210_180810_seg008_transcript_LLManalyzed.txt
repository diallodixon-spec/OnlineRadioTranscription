I was holding on I was holding on for a better day I was holding on, I was holding strong I was holding on, see I was going strong See I was holding on for a better day The road is rocky but I'm strong, people wanna hold it down That is all a part of it Realization, on my destination I don't have no time to stray Come and take me behind the truck and we rev it up Whole day, keep throwing it back at the way you stop Baby no way, we could post up all the pictures you want When you're ready, I go over here, darling
