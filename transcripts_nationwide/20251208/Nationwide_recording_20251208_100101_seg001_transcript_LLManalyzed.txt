Cliff Hughes online. Talk radio for all Jamaicans. My hands were steady. My eyes were clear and bright. My walk had purpose. My steps were quick and light. And I held firm to what I felt was right. Like a rock. Like a rock, like a rock I was strong as I could be Like a rock, nothing ever got to me Like a rock, I was something to see, like a rock And I stood arrow straight Unencumbered by the weight of all these hustlers and their schemes
