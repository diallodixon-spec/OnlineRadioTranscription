I wanna drink I'll tell you what I got in mind Oh, I don't know your name But I feel like that's gonna change You ain't gotta be my lover You can call me baby Never open up, I know I'm precious Ain't that serious? Can we We keep With each other company Maybe we can be with each other's company Oh company Everybody gets high sometimes, you know What else can we do when we're feeling low? So take a deep breath and let it go
