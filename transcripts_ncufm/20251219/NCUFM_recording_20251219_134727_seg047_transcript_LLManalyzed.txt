20251219 134727 Sin broke in upon the order that God had established and discord followed. So long as sin exists, suffering and death are inevitable. It is only because the Redeemer has borne the curse of sin in our behalf that man can hope to escape in his own person its dire results. So yes, the unconditional pardon of sin never has been and never will be. There is one who suffered for your sin and mine. It is because of his suffering why we have forgiveness. Jesus did it for us and he has given us life. Will you embrace that life today? We'll see you tomorrow. That was your Sabbath School Nugget with Pastor Robert Rice.
