20251225 142932 I don't know what to do with you right now And much to my surprise I've realized that no matter what I do I'm never gonna let you go So baby, gotta learn to please tell me to go Cause I just can't take it without you, oh yeah Just wait, I'm partying my own heart, my own heart Baby, one look at you It's like running when it's a precious thing And we'll never run away from it It's like living inside and never look back
