============================================================

by grace i stand i won't fall down jesus lifted me off the ground through every trial he's been so near i'm walking free no more fear by grace i stand by grace i rise my hope is shining through the skies it's not by works it's not by fame but by the power of jesus name I was broken, lost in shame Caught in chains I couldn't name But mercy came and found my cry Now I sing with lifted eyes No condemnation in my soul
