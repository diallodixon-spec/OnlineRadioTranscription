20251224 142925 There are still some stories being reported that we have to give a word or two on. I took some notes. I'm begging you to ease me up this afternoon. I did take some notes on some stories I'd like to make a quick mention on. And the first one has to do with the developments surrounding an alleged killer that was captured recently by the St. Elizabeth police. We'll dive into that and of course do a quick, quick rundown of a couple of issues issues in the news then we dive into From the Archives and then it's all you in addition to the Christmas songs this afternoon. It's gonna be a great Christmas Eve edition of Both Sides of the Story. We'll be right back.
