20251225 195345 We don't think it's long enough now To believe in the life of the love I can't believe it's too near to start to stop If they don't say it's too late You didn't know that I'd live without you You didn't for you I've gotten over you I'm not in love with you I've been through the fires and the rain But I live to love you
