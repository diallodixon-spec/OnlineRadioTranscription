They ripped me off like false lashes and then threw me away And all the headshots on the walls Of the dancehall are of the witches Who wish I'd hurry up and die But I'm immortal now, baby dolls I couldn't if I tried So I say Thank you for the lovely bouquet I'm married to the hustle and now I know the life of a showgirl, babe And I'll never know another Pain hidden by the lipstick and lace Secrets are forever and now I know The life of a showgirl, babe Wouldn't have it any other way
