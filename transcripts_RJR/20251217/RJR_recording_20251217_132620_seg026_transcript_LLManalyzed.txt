20251217 132620 I like this I like this Dale, I like this No, because I never like how it moves It moves without even nothing being said She just come in here, shh shh shh Like little mouse, like at the cape, I say oh it's a bird, it's a plane, no it's Anna gone with the cape Anna leave my cape Anna Anna come Listeners, if you ever know where I'm going in here She not come and say hi guys, okay But how did everybody else get involved because Emily said the cake is for the team The way, the way, the way Anna moved for a while ago, it seemed like the whole world. So Anna, when they are from man, you're not only never get none. It wasn't that whole cake when me come in. So who eat the half? Who eat the half, who eat the first half? Me can't find a song. Me can't even see it right now. No, who eats the first half? Listeners, listeners, my apologies.
