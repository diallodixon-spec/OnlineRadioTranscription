20251231 203725 You know the night is getting colder Just when I thought that it was over Realized that I can't be denied your love It's taking me over Many times I've tried to spend too many lives on unforgiving you But you've got your foolish pride You know down deep inside I'm breaking all the rules But what else can I do? Cause for tonight Little love that can't go light For tonight Little love that can't be lied Can't we be in love for just one night?
