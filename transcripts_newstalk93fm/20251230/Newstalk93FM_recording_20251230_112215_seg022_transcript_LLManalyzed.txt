20251230 112215 DJ Fresh, it's another one, oh, oh, oh. La-la-la-la, yeah, yeah. It's a ocean of loving where you are for me. Right in the middle. Say no, say the thing. We mark it. And even though the suns will come, no we won't rock, just love me, deep as the blue sea. Yeah, yeah, that you're deeper than the blue sea. I've seen many, but I still pick you just like a fruit tree. Look in my eyes, what do you see? I see happiness, me and you are kickin' like Bruce Lee. Baby girl, me want you to pray this. One day without your lovin' and the rest I get to see.
