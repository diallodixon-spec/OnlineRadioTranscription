20251218 135224 Tell me how could I ever forget to be I'm tellin' you, brother, you better put that woman first. And you love her, she ain't wearin' her ring. And she starts playin' little games. Come in and make a move. You better put that woman back. So many times, actin' like it wasn't really nothin'. So many ways, just to myself I was running. So many games, all that has meant. So many words, I need you to stay. Always came first, even though sometimes felt like second. Came out of love, you know I had you.
