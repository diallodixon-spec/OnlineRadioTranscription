My people don't fight, my people don't fight. High, little, lofty thumbs to Jesus Christ. My people don't fuss, my people don' fight. Genesis, Revelation, everything right. My people don' fuss, my people dont' fight. Oh, we should all unite. My people dont' fuss, My people don't faaaaaaight. Don't worry, my people, don't you ever forget. Give John the glory with every single step that you take now. So don't you worry, my people. Don't you ever forget, no, no, no. Give just the glory with every single breath that you take now. Just love, higher than the mountains, is deeper than the sea.
