Canada, Europe, we are one family We rise again, rise again When the storm take your roof and fence, we rise again The rising is a must in a bay The continent, we rise again Rise again, foreign hate so raised for me Land and friend, we rise again We rise again, cause the old man spirit never die Mrs. Infants fly like kites, we still oppose we are right A lot of the best of Triton. Hey, boogie don't record. People were white, stretch them out See the rent can't jump, we suck With spirit price, less can't control From y'all to abroad, we roll Same one out, same one go We rise again, try y'all when the storm take a roof off Try y'all when they storm take a roof again
