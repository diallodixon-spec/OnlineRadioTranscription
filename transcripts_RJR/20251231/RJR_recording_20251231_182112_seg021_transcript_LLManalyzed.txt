20251231 182112 The east side is okay. Why are you calling it the east side? Why are you putting a line of delineation between the east side and the west side? Well, the east side of Tamarack is the original Tamarack. That is where Ken Bering, who founded Tamarack some years ago, had started Tamarack in one little community on the east. And so because of that, that part of the city is older, it's more historic, and so it did not have the level of service that the west side had. So later on, the west side of Tamarack was developed, so that's where the community center was, that's where the library was, better roads, better infrastructure, water was there, that sort of stuff. And my side of town was not so, not so good, right? And so I said to them, I want a community center to be over here. I want better infrastructure. I want, you know, bus systems, bus stops to be here.
