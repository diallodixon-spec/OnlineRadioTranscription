I'm looking for a new love, baby, a new love. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm lookin' for a new love. Baby, a new love, yeah, yeah, yeah! Was she hot? Did she turn you? Yeah, baby. Anytime the world is crazy, all I have to do to calm it is just think of you. It's when I think of you, baby. Nothing else seems to matter. It when I think of you, baby, all I think of is love. I just get more attached to you.
