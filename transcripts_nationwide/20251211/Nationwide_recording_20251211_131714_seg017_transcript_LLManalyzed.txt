I got your love beside me, child, that's all I need My heart and soul is wide open to you Nobody but you, sweet baby, no one but you Gotta know that I want you, baby Gotta know that I need you, darling I just wanna say You're my everything Like in all the songs I sing so easy All the loving you gave me That fills me sure
