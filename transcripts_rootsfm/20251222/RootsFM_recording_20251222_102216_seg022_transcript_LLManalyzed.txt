20251222 102216 I've been asking a deer to play a Luther Vandross Christmas song, but this isn't the one. I thought this was the one, but it's okay, because anything that Luther Vandross sings, yeah, trust me, me love it. See you don't know, our mission Monday, you know, the mission is for our people out there to be celebrating the Christmas holidays. Coming up on Thursday, Boxing Day, Friday, we're going for the first day of quantum. Don't be discouraged Don't be dismayed There's hope for all in this world Cause this is Christmas Day
