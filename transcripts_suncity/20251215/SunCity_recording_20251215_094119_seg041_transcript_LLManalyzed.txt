20251215 094119 I was like, sometimes people are not even worth addressing. Yeah. That's right. But if it gets to a point where you are uncomfortable, don't address them. Go to what she's saying. She's uncomfortable. So if you're uncomfortable now, you make sure that you, um, you send an email. Yeah. Always do black and white people. Um, have proof that you you mentioned this and you you know, this is how you feel about the situation and management is now in the know so that you're protecting yourself. So the next time somebody feel like they want to talk about the side of their mouth and you want to address them, you won't be the first to be in problem when you address address them because she's spreading rumors about her and she's also undermining her in meetings so yeah she's saying now it's at a point where you know she's feeling uncomfortable about it because I was gonna say after you said how stay silent I will say boy
