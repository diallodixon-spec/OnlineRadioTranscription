He later returned to the United Kingdom for further medical checks. Joshua's promoter's matchroom boxing extended condolences to the families of Gami and Ayodele, describing the loss as devastating. Gami served as Joshua's full-time rehabilitation coach for more than a decade, helping prepare the former world champion for some of the biggest fights of his career, including his 2017 title-winning bout against Vladimir Klitschko and this month's victory over Jake Paul. Ayodele, also known as Lats, was a personal trainer and longtime friend of the boxer. Just hours before the crash, Joshua posted a video of the pair playing table tennis. Nigeria's Federal Road Safety Corps said five adult men were involved in the crash and confirmed preliminary findings suggest the vehicle may have been traveling above the speed limit before losing control during an overtaking maneuver.
