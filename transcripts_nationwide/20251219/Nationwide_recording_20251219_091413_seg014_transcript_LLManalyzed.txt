20251219 091413 But this is antenna with NCB, man. This is not my problem. I could care less what is happening in the background over there. Because if you have any issue with NCB, you lose your money. You know how long you have to wait to get that back. It takes you 90 days or anything. So I have no mercy and I could care less. What is happening at the bank. We need more money. It's over a week we waiting and you can't get anything definitive from the bank. I heard they were trying to get somebody um on the show nobody respond i need to call them out man i am annoyed yeah all right so yes i did i did hear um george antono talking about this issue and of course there are many many people on social media talking about uh this issue with ncb's rtgs system now now my my problem with the communication line with NCB is that you are, I would go as far as to say, the largest bank in Jamaica. I feel, I think, I would go out on a limb to say NCB has the largest customer base.
