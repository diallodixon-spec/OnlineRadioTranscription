20251226 180104 You might as touch on the Chevy door November flush and you flannel cure This dog was once a madhouse I made a joke, well it's made for me How? Evergreen, a group of friends Don't think we'll say that word again And soon they'll have the nerve to Take the holes that we once walked through One for the money, two for the show I never was ready, so I'll watch you go Sometimes you just don't know the answer To someone's on their knees and ask you She would've made such a lovely bride What a shame she's fucked in the head, they said But you'll find the real thing instead She'll patch up your tapestry that I've shred Hold your hand while dancing Never leave you standing Quest for love
