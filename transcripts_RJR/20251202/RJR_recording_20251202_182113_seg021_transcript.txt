yesterday a very good report from Odpem that they now have in place a proper system to manage inventory so very soon we should be able to have a public access website where we can see everything that comes in and everything that is given. We will put an end to this deliberate, malicious attempt to destroy the reputation of the government. Madam Government, the Office of Disaster Preparedness and Emergency Management, and the Ministry of Labour and Social Security to release all information about the public aid given to Members of Parliament. And he's doing so because he's objecting to criticisms about the distribution. There should not be a rat race.
