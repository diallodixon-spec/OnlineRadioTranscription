One careless decision can change a family forever. Let's have a safe and prayer? We have a program just for you. Just for us? Yes, just for you. It's even a child right here on NCU FM. 91.1, 91.3, and 91.5. So join us every Sabbath morning at 8 a.m. This Hour in the Drive is brought to you by the Forestry Department.
