20260101 105854 Hello. Oh, hello, God. I'm so glad you called. I have some really tough finals coming up, and I could sure use some extra wisdom. Also, I'm still trying to find an inexpensive car. Do you think you could arrange something? Are your prayers just shopping lists for God to fill out? Is that God on the line? Yeah. Tell him we need a miracle for the rent money this month. Oh, OK. Uh, God, our funds are low and any help you could provide. Did you mention the car? Yeah, I told him. Anything else? Yeah, my date this Saturday night. I'd like it to turn out nice. And Bob is going out. Uh, don't let Bob make a fool out of himself again. Did you tell him? Oh, yeah. Mention to him that I'm failing birdwatching 101. I need a hand. I'm not going to tell him. How can you fail birdwatching? Jesus told us to bring our needs and concerns to him, but he also taught us to pray, Father, thy will be done. So that was God on the line, huh? What do you want? I don't know. I didn't ask. Another message from Lifeline Productions.
