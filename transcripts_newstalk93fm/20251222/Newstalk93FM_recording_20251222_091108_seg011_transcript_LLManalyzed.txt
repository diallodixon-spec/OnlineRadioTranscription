20251222 091108 I love my culture, I love where we from. We get these powers from the same nation. Sweet like steel, drop the sweetest vibrations. Don't let the rhythm get you, just run, run, run. Even you could handle it, German. But like when the man will hide, we gon' rip it up a spine. Oh, lord, oh, yeah. Goodbyes and party, we love it. Sweet woman, we have it. Raise this for the planet, boy. Somebody read your love, playin' a song, and it's goin' off, oh.
