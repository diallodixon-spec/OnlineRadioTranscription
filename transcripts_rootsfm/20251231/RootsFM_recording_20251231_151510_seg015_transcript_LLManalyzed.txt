Nobody seems to be home, so let me just proceed with Desmondek and the Aces once again inside what we call the Barber Play. We're exactly in Jamaica. Would you find Shantytown? Pick up your telephone. I got a bag if you answer correctly. 8-7-6-7-9-1-7-2-8-3. You Let me touch your telephone line. Good afternoon. Talk to me. What's up? Oh, it's mr. Rose.
