20251219 174832 Baby, I've got so much love to give you. If there's more than enough to last the whole night through. Oh, oh, oh, you. My world runs full on empty, oh yes, oh yes, and my life was unfulfilled. When I needed someone to put me up, baby, you were so, so, so willing. Now to you it may seem just like a little thing But to me it's like singing world on a string I've got so much love to give you
