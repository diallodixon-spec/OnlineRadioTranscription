20251223 174828 The Polar Express, listen, that is one of the best animated films to ever be made and for me it's not just a holiday favourite, it's one of the best ones. Yeah, actually I remember, that's actually a repressed memory for me because I do remember watching The Polar Express when I was very young and it was very emotional. It wasn't emotional, it was about believing. It's big on that. And today, I was struggling to remember the plot because as you said, it's been a while since I saw it. I went and revised the plot and it was really fun. It's basically their trip to the North Pole and it's filled with a ton of adventure. I really loved it. Yeah, and I think it stars Tom Hanks. I think I read in the production that Tom Hanks did a lot of those voices right for the for the cast so it's it's impressive it's impressive I have one more you know Mr. Leandre I'm not leaving you out you know you normally work behind the scenes but tonight this afternoon you're going on the air I want to hear one of your holiday favorites I don't know why I'm on the air this evening Matthew with you but I'm happy
