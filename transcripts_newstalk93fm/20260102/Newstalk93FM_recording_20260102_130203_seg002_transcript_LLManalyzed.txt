20260102 130203 And it's nothing too risky Limited liability Don't worry If you try all the things I like You could still be shy in the morning So don't feel away You don't like the fast life But look on the bright side, girl I go take the blame I just want you come and rise it up Just a little whine there now Come and meet me behind the truck and we rev it up Say hold it, keep throwing it back I know why you stopped us up Baby no way, we could post up all the pictures you want When you're ready, I could overshare No I ain't I go over there. But we compete in the middle and start a bacchanal. Play in the middle, hey. What we gonna do now? Jam to a rhythm, yeah. We eat a carnival, but we be heat, hey. But we gonna do now, start a wine on it. I say compromise on it, baby.
