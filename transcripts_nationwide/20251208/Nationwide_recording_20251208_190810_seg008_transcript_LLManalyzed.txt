If ICE does not have a judicial warrant signed by a judge, you have the right. So, Secretary Johnson, much was made of the meeting that Mayor-elect Mamdani had with President Trump in the White House last month. It's certainly a show of good feelings, but there's never been a real belief that the federal government wouldn't turn its attention to New York City at some point after January 1st.

It's simply going to be a different matter.
