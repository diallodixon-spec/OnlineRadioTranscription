Why you don't come? I don't feel like coming. Why don't you come? I dont feel like coming. I sent my dog at you. I don't care. I sent my cat at you. I dont care. Well, listen. Here. Got a letter from Miami. In that letter was a dollar I threw that dollar and bought me some candy But to give the candy to you, my baby Keep on lovin' me, never stop When my lovin' got picked it up Send a jilly tree till it drops When the jilly said pick it up! When the jilly drops! Come on!
