============================================================

no chimney smoke no bells to chime just the clock above my head ticking in time. But your bright eyes lights up the room all right. You're my holiday. You're my star tonight. Sorry, Santa, I don't want to waste your time. Give someone else a present, I've got mine. Got everything I need right here with me. Merry Christmas, everyone, wherever you may be. I don't need a stocking or a fireplace. Cause I have here to put a smile on.
