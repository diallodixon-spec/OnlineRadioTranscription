20251229 120305 over the length of the two-year investigation into fraud allegations at investment firms, stocks, and Securities Limited, SSL. The security agencies leading the probe say the charges laid over the weekend are the result of extensive financial investigations and coordinated multi-agency efforts. Three former executives of SSL were arrested and charged with several fraud-related offenses on the weekend. They were granted station bail and are due in court on January 26. The accused are former director Hugh Crossgray, former Montego Bay branch manager Sarah Meany, and ex-CEO Zachary Harding. Investigators say the SSL investigation commenced in 2023 after the laying of fraud-related charges against former SSL employee Jean Ann Panton in February of that year. Head of the Constabulary Financial Unit, Inspector Brenton Williams, says what followed next was the meticulous gathering of key evidence.
