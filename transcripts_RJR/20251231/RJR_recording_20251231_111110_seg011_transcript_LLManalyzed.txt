Members of the public are advised that it is illegal to park along Palisades Road for the purpose of viewing the fireworks on Wednesday, December 31st and absolutely no vehicle will be permitted to park on the roadway. Additionally, no parking will be allowed on the right-hand side of the road heading towards Norman Manor International Airport between 5 p.m. on Wednesday and 1230 a.m. on Thursday. Motorists found in breach will be prosecuted and their vehicles will be told. Alright, so spread the word if you haven't seen that already. I'm taking the opportunity to share it with you just seeing this on social media so you don't want to end up going to the New Year and you're walking although you drove to where you were. Alright, so a word to the wise is sufficient.
