20251223 122824 I want to make it to heaven. I just want to be with you. I just wanna be with you. Cause I wanna make it to heaven I wanna leave the mountain with you Cause I'm high in the pain. I can swim the deepest ocean Because I'm in your grace I can tell you it's amazing Feeling cool like I'm under shade Even with the trials I'm facing I still want to make it to heaven Just to be with you, just to be with you I wanna make it to heaven
