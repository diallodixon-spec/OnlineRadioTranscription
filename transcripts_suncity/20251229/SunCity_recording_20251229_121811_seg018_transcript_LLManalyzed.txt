20251229 121811 This is Taneese Morrison aka Soul Child Taneese and you are listening to Sun City Radio. Radio with a difference rebuilding Jamaica. So we break it The light of the music, I feel trapped so nice The light of the bullets, I pour down dry Give me the music like me skank and wine Turn up the music like me rockin' all the time The light of the a fever. Pop and drive. I be a couple of years, man, to go back to my head. Give me your music, let me skank and run. Turn up the music, let me rock it like the dance. Stand under, under the one that I hate to be bound here.
