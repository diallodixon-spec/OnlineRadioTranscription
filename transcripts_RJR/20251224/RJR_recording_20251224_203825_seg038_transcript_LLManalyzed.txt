20251224 203825 I just came here to party. But now we're rocking on the dance floor acting naughty. Your hands are on my waist. Just let the music play. We're hand in hand just to trust and now we face the fate. I wanna take you away. Just escape into the music. DJ, let it play. I just can't refuse it. Like the way you do, just keep on rocking to it. Please don't stop the, please don't stop the music I wanna take you away Let's just cave into this music T.J. let it play I just can't refuse it Like the way you do Just keep on rock'n' to it Please dont stop the, please dont stop the Please dont stop the music
