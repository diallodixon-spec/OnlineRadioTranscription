20260101 200102 of Hurricane Melissa. Our nation needs you more than ever. The National Blood Transfusion Service is urgently appealing to you, me, anyone and everyone who can to give blood and give life. Our hospitals are struggling and every pint you donate helps mothers, children, accident victims and countless others fighting to survive. Your one pint is their second chance. Let's do this. Have a good meal, hydrate, and bring your ID with you to your nearest donation point at either the Blood Bank on Slidepin Road, University Hospital, National Chest Hospital, St. Anne's Bay Hospital, Maypin Hospital, Spanish Town Hospital, or the Mandeville and Porta Coney Hospitals. Remember, too, that the National Chest and Spanish Town Hospitals are open to collection on Saturdays. Roll up your sleeves and be a hero today. Your one pint is their second chance. Give blood. Save a life. Rebuild Jamaica.
