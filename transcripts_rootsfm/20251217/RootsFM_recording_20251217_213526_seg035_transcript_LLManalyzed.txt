20251217 213526 I lost my man in a fight last night. I called him and cheated with another chick. Get them busy on the couch and the TV light. Guess they'll never know I'd be back so quick. He was on his back. She was underneath. And I swear I could hear her say, baby, please. Now he's trying to tell me it's not what it seems. All the neighbors could hear when I started screaming. I say, baby, I ain't mad that you're cheating. I know every man cheats, but I've fallen for girls in the world. Why such an ugly girl? And don't tell me you're sorry That won't make it no easier Pack your things up and leave One with your ugly girl
