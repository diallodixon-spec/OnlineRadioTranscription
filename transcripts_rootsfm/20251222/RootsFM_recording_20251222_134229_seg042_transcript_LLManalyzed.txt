20251222 134229 You're always on my mind Every hour, every minute, every second of my time I'm addicted to your smell and to your skin and to your smile Because the memories you left me of, your touch is so fine Searching for your tenderness, I keep on trying But I forget to love you down the line When you're driving through Kingston, who do you listen to? Roots Affirm, 906.1 Baby girl, you know your love is stained in my memory So right now, got to sing this song so you remember me
