The government's reconstruction strategy is broken into three phases, with each building on the previous one. Now, the focus is on restoring electricity, water, communication network, access roads and temporary shelters. Once communities stabilise, the priority shifts to reopening schools, restoring health centres, supporting farmers and small businesses and restarting local economies. A central pillar of the government's national recovery strategy is direct support for micro, small and medium-sized enterprises, the backbone of Jamaica's economy and the most vulnerable to prolonged disruption.
