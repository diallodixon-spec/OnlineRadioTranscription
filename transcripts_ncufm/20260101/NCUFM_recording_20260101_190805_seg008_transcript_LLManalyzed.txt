20260101 190805 You woke me up this morning, trying to be on my way. You wouldn't hold up my table, if you were just in my day. My time's up, time has never changed. And I'm wonderful, and I'm wonderful and I'm wonderful, wonderful is your name. You woke me up this morning, started me on my way, put food on my table, brought joy to my day. I tell you never change. And wonderful, and wonderful, and wonderful. Wonderful is your name.
