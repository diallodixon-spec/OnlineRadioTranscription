Hey, I come to mash up the place nobody taking my space don't know the risk that we take just to put food on the plate Lightning and turn the earthquake think you can walk in my shoes, man. You can't even tie the laces man hungry, hungry soon turn to anger, then anger turn to danger, ain't need no one nobody come and tell me bout my temper, no retreat no surrender, you sit on your veranda and think it's cool for ghetto youth to suffer well. Guess who's coming to dinner?
