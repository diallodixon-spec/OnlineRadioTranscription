20251222 110204 Ophelia lived in fantasy The love was a cold bed Full of scorpions The venom stole her sanity And if you'd never call for me I might have lingered in purgatory You wrap around me like a chain Acha A crowd, a fire Pulling me into the fire All that time I sat alone in my tower You were just haunting your powers Now I can see it all They won Now you've tucked me out of my grave and saved my heart from the fate of Ophelia I'll keep you at 100 on the land, let's save the sky Pledge allegiance to your hands, your team, your vibes I don't care where the hell you've been
