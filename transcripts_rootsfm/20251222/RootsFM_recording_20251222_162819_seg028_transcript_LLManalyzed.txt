Now watch the lateness cause we are Jamaican. 12 o'clock when I don't see him, I start to read. 1 o'clock and I turn it up when he gets up. I start wondering if them robbing put a cap in his head. I feel guilty how I vexed when the man probably did something. Pick up my phone and start calling up my friends. Jump in on my car and go circle some men. Scumbag in the house and's your story? You could have seen, me a go disturb the peace. peace. What's your story. Somebody please, run over the police. What's the story? Come on now, come on now. Do you have a sense to me? Come on now. Come on now.
