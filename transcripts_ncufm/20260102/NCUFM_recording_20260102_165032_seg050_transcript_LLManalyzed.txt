I'm going higher, higher, stepping on the clouds. Going past the moon, the stars, and the planets, I'm'm gonna walk on the milky white way when all day forever is a single. I'm gonna leave for heaven to stay. Stepping on the clouds, we will see Jesus rise to meet him in the air. Stepping on the cloud, he will greet us, all the joy together we'll share. I'm going to leave this world behind me, going where the devil cannot find me. I'm going higher.
