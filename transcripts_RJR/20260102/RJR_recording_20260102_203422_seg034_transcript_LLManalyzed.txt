The sprint queens fight until the very last metre to bring home silver, adding yet another chapter to Jamaica's legendary relay dynasty. He came off the bench and turned the game on its head. De Jong whisper Richard's dances through the defense and buries it. The goal by Ronaldo Cifas at World Cup qualifier versus Trinidad and Tobago. Blink and you'll miss him. Ronaldo Cifas turns on the jets, leaves the defense in the dust and fires Jamaica one step closer to the World Cup. Horse racing. I dream again winning the Jamaica Derby. On Independence Day, a dream comes true at Caymanas Park. I dream again roars down the home stretch to capture the Derby in a finish that will be talked about for years.
