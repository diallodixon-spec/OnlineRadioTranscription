20251216 120506 Lord, I pray even now that we will see and come to know the true meaning of what Christmas is, the Christ who came. We thank you that we have hope in knowing, Lord, that you are the All-God. And as we look to you, O God, our solicitor, our help, our everlasting Father, our Prince of Peace, you remind us, O God, that the government shall be upon your shoulder. Whatever it is, therefore, Lord, that we may be confronted with, it is already on your shoulder. The song says if you carry the weight of the world upon your shoulder, I know my brother, my sister, that you will take care of us.
