20251229 192215 Dreaming, I must be dreaming Or am I really lying here with you? Baby, you take me in your arms And though I'm wide awake, I know my dream is coming true And oh, if I just fall in love again Just one touch and then it happens every time. And there I go again. I just fall in love again when I do.
