It was not so long ago We talked about the same thing Darling why Please tell me why Do lovers behave in such a way? Didn't you know that love means Never to say that you're sorry No, no, no, no How could you hurt the one you love Just like you don't care? No, no, it's such a waste Just the other night You told me that you loved me You whispered in my ear Sweet words I long to hear When you touched my spine It was heavenly fine It's hard to tell
