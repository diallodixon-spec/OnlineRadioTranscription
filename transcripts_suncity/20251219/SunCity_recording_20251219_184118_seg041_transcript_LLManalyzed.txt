20251219 184118 I'm over, don't say no I don't spare my ego Let me know the fight Better hold me tight But, but That's the way of sorrows The night is young And time is borrowed Can I see you tonight? Nobody knows tomorrow Let me know the fighting Better hold. We'll be here forever. So love me now or never, babe. I know the truth is bitter. So give me something sweeter, babe. Bend it over. I know your world is over. My baby's spread all over me. Oh, I'm ready.
