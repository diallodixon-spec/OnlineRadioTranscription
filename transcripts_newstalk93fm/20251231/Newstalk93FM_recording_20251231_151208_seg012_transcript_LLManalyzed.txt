20251231 151208 With my head to the ceiling See I'm drowning alone and I'm lost in my feelings Somebody send me a sign cuz you know that I need it Can't even come back to me cuz you know you're my healing. Show me love, win the punch, show me love. Together, say we all need love. Jump up and show me love. Win the punch show me love. So come back, we're strong enough together. No place that I'd rather be. Strong enough together. Right now is our energy. Showing up together. Soccer is our pattern. We're strong enough together, strong enough together.
