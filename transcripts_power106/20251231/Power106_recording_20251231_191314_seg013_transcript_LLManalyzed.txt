20251231 191314 Someone's thinking of me And loving me tonight Somewhere out there Someone's saying a prayer That we'll find one another And even though I know how very far apart we are It helps to think we might be wishing on the same bright star. And when the night wind starts to sing a lonesome lullaby, it helps to think we're sleeping underneath the same big sky.
