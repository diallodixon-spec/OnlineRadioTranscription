Look at people in here tonight I miss you baby And it's you running through me mind Stay with me baby I might even whine if you give me time like you want this darling I have something for you right there I'm catching a feeling Right up on your bumper baby I know where you from miss lady I'll fuck you deep and go down there I know you're not easy Long time I've been waiting for you I got something for you And it's time to leave in the morning And you feel for somebody
