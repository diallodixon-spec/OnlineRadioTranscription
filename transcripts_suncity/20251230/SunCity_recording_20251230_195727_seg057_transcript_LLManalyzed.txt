20251230 195727 I love all the kids that I play. I wish we could all be like children one day. Dancing and splashing and holding hands. No matter so loud, give me the light. Across the world, our light still shines. Together we are one people. One people. One country. One country. Spreading love everywhere we go. Hey, one country, spreading love everywhere we go.
