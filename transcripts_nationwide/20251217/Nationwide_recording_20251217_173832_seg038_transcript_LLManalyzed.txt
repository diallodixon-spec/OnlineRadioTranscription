20251217 173832 still have matters to discuss outside of climate change and we are coming to the end of the year and as always we have concerns regarding road fatalities and as the country celebrates a 43% reduction in murders there are concerns about the number of road fatalities as at Wednesday December 17 361 Jamaicans have been killed in 315 accidents in 2025. This represents a 3% increase when compared to the corresponding period last year. For the entire year of 2024, 365 persons were killed on the nation's roads. In reacting to the figures, Transport Minister Daryl Vaas says with murders down, Jamaica must now turn its attention to lowering the rate of the road fatalities rather. Very, very, very concerned. As a matter of fact, I consider it to be a crisis now. I think that now that we've got the murder rate down significantly, that the road fatalities are now the number one killers.
