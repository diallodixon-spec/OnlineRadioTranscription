Let's shout this name singing about Oh my God! We're glad for you in every way Yes Oh my God! You're a good example to all I say Oh my God! Oh! Marcos Masaya Gave Oh my God! Now think he might erase And remember where we're coming from We still got a long, long way to go Let's fight this hard, long struggle But not with sticks and stones With strength, courage and dignity I know one day we shall overcome singing back now Oh my God! We're glad for you in so many ways and Oh my God! You're a good example to all
