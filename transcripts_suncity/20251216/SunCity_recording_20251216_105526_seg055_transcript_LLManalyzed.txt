20251216 105526 Hey Rock, you know the songs of Danny English featuring Ross Bogle? Hey, this one World Wanna Dance? When you hear it, you know you can get a groovy dance in 5x, eh no? Hey, is you ready with a different Sun city world premiere set. Hey, shout out to all the people who be dancing here yesterday, the best of the 90s. December the 26th is a cool year, I swear. You know, the gates open, you know, gates open at 9pm and the mass camp comes alive for sure.
