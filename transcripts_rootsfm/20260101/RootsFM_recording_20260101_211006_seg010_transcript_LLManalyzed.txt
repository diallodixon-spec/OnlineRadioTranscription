20260101 211006 I've been through this too long Will I be down if I see another chick on your arm? Don't you wake me up more Will I be down, if I see another check on your arm? Tell me how should I feel when you make me belong? In the thought of you just touching her is what I hate most I don't want you but I believe and I can't let it go To know you give it to her like you gave it to me, come on! I let you go, I can't let you go, no matter if I let you go She don't want to meet me at all, I let you go In the back of all the roads, I'll let you go She gonna run at everything I talk, I let you I let you go No matter if I let to go I'm a fool, how can you look at me? And that's the only way that I get the lead
