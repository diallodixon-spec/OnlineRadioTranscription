20251224 104527 I have a lightning spirit Early in the morning I hat it Me cooler ready, me ice done ready Me punching that's automatic I have a lightning jumbie A kind of energy inside me And it ready for the rum, ready ready for the rum Ready ready for the rum ready for the action A spiritual encounter In me soul taking over Telling me to start up the drinking Can do away with good behaviour So let we go, let we go down the road Let we go, it's action time Let we go It's bacchanal time Let we go Hands up! This vetting spirit of me feeling good This sweating spirit havin' me feelin' good!
