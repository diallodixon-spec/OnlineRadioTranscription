20251222 213121 Just a little winding up Come and meet me behind the truck and we rev it up Whole day, keep throwing it back at the way you stop Baby, no way, we could post up all the pictures you want When you're ready, I go over here Darling, you go over there But we compete in the middle and start a bacchanal Play in the middle, hey, what we gonna do now to a rhythm in the heat I can't evolve but in the heat, hey What we gon' do now Start a wine on it I say compromise on it Baby, spend time on it, hey I say compromise on me, hey Can we talk some business? You know I want your company And it's nothing too risky limited liability don't worry if you try all the things i like you could still be shy in the morning so don't feel away you don't like the fast life
