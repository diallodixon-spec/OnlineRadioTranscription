20251219 140102 We kick off with news in football as Jamaica's reggae boys could face Nigeria in a final shot at qualifying for the 2026 FIFA World Cup, depending on the outcome of a complaint lodged with FIFA by the Nigerian Football Federation. Nigeria have challenged the eligibility of players used by the Democratic Republic of Congo in last month's African Playoff Final, which DR Congo won on penalties to secure a place in the Inter-Confederation playoff in March. The Reggae Boys are already confirmed for that three-team playoff group and will open their campaign against New Caledonia, with the winner set to face the African representative for a place at the World Cup in North America next summer. However, that African slot could change if FIFA upholds Nigeria's protest, as reports say the Super Eagles allege fraud, claiming that several players who recently switched allegiance to DR Congo were ineligible due to Congolese citizenship laws. Among the players named are Aaron Wan-Bissaka and Axel Twanzebi, both of whom featured in the decisive match.
