Making my way downtown, walking fast Face this path and I'm homebound Staring blankly ahead, just making my way Making my way through the crowd And I need you And I miss you And now I wonder If I could fall into the sky Do you think time would pass me by? Cause you know I'd walk a thousand miles If I could just see you tonight There's always times like these When I think of you And I wonder if you ever see me
