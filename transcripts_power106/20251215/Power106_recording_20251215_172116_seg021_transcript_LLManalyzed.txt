Um, and you know, I was traveling recently and there was a little young guy that had this station with all of the tight, these airplane model airplanes and mother cars and trucks and tractors and all kinds of things. And he came over with his father and I'm like, boy, boys, they're just so different, you know? So I thought I was so excited and the things that will stimulate you, right? So what are, coming from our list now, what are we looking at? We're seeing trips to Germany, a road trip to Germany. Yeah, this is one of my bucket list dreams. One of the things I want to go to Europe, that's on top of that. Well, not just mainland Europe. Well, actually, I've been to mainland Europe. But yeah, I wanted to go to Germany and go to the Nürburgring specifically. So at one point, at any point, at the point in time that I'm able to do so, I will be taking a road trip from Germany.
