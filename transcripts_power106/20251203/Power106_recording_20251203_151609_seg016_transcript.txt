Alright, this is both sides of the story here on PAW 106 FM. A reminder that at 3.30 this afternoon we pause for a very worthy cause to recognize the celebrations today associated with the International Day of Persons with Disabilities. Today is the international day of persons with disabilities. We'll endeavor to have a word with the executive director of the Jamaica Council for persons with disabilities, Dr. Christine Hendricks, right after the 3.30 break. And on a programming note, another one, we are having some issues in relation to Digicel calls. Right, Davin?
