Before you put it on the item that you're gonna iron. Where they used to have the pressing? Now usually outside I'm on table. You don't know that? You have ironing board, man. The three halves. Where? Like when that? We didn't have it. You mean? If you make them own iron board. When they used to use those iron, they never had an iron board man. They have tables. They used to have one table. I used to use sheet to pad it up. Thank you very much. With a big pin. You remember those pins that you used to use on nappies? But in this case they they never had the pin on the table still. They may have had it on the iron board that you're telling me about. The table that they used to use the sheet, the patchwork sheet, you know? Patchwork? You don't know what they call patchwork? I don't think I remember. I don't remember that one.
