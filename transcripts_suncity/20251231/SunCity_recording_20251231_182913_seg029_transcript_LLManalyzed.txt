20251231 182913 You said you weren't around much anymore I stopped dropping by without an appointment Cause I heard laughter coming through your door Sometimes later nights you'll still call me Before you close your eyes to sleep, yeah I made a vow that I would drop by sometimes But that's a promise I can make Love you too much to ever start liking you. Let's leave the story at an end. I love you to much to ever start like you. So don't expect me to be your friend.
