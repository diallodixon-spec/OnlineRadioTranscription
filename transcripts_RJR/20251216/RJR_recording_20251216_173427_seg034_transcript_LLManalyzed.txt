20251216 173427 killing took place in 2014, and you now run into the issue of whether or not Mr. Stevenson could have received a fair trial within a reasonable time. And you may remember from the cartel case some of the issues that arose there. Adlai Duncan, former Deputy DPP here in Jamaica, now Senior Crown Counsel in Bermuda, and C.J. Mitchell, Senior Counsel, who represented Conroy Stevenson in this matter. Gentlemen, appreciate you joining us. Thank you so much. I thank you. No problem. Great to have you both on. Adlai, let me start with you. Perhaps we take a step back, maybe, and explain to my listeners this whole issue about what a judge should and should not do according to the Court of Appeal. Sure. Well, first, I'm actually a deputy in Bermuda. Thank you. Yes, love that. Thank you so much. I was listening to the last time we spoke. But, yeah, man, I love that. But getting to more serious matters now in terms of explaining the role of the judge, especially as outlined by the court of appeal.
