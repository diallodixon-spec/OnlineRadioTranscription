You never knew the sweetness of your love, oh yeah Say what, lady, oh yeah Saying to me, did you mean to tell me It put you down for another And what, lady oh yeah Showing me, did you meant to tell me It's all you're out? Another loss is another man's game. I'm in the position to ease your pain. I'll build this dream up for me and you. So tell me, baby, when you're coming home, I promise you will never be alone. Set a table, baby, just for two. Say what, lady? You're saying to me, give your music to me.
