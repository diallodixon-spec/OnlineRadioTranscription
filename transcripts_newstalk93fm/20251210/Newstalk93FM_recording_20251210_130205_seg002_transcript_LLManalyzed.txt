Jump on the day comes Jump on the day I tell my wife I love your vibe But you should come along She sendin' vines to all we like Now we bout 40 strong Who on the left, who on the right We goin' out your town My relatives, they want the line But I tell them Take it to you when I come back This time I will come back Later, I will come on In the last lap away from that street Who the vibe work on You don't know how I wait. So when you see them two this come around, this time is my time to jump out. My time to run about. My time to get something and get unbound on this long road. Movin' with me so loud, still I'm movin' like a stone. Windin' on all them girls from East, West, north and south As we do, as we do As we do Jump when the day comes Jump when the day, jump when the day comes
