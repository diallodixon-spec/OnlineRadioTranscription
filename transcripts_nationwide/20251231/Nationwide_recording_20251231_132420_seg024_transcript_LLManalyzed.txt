20251231 132420 day we're a flame in the wind not the fire that we begun every argument every word we can't take back cause with all that has happened i think that we both know the way that this story ends then only for a minute i want to change my mind cause this just don't feel right to me i wanna raise your spirits I want to see you smile Know that means I'll you to be happier When the evening falls And I'm left there with my thoughts And the image of you being with someone else Well it's eating me up inside
