where we take pride and comfort in having family around and having a meal together. So in particular, we want to address the issue of specials. We all love a deal. And we just want to say to you, be careful in how you purchase these deals. Supermarkets are not doing anything wrong. I just want to say be careful. Look out for, you must look out for the expiry date. If you're purchasing a bundled item that's near expiration, you need to be careful. Is it that you're going to say it expires in three days? If you're going to use it tomorrow, that's great. But if it is that you see you're going to have to hold on to it beyond the expiration date, please don't buy it.
