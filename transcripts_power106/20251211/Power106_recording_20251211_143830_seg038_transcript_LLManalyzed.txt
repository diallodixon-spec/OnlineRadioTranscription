============================================================

Don't keep me waiting cause I can't be patient anymore Anticipate and tell me who has stopped the clock I hung my stocking and my baby's knocking on the door Knock, knock, knock I'm begging you Please say please make my dreams Underneath the tree come true Make all of my dreams come true For making my Christmas blue Cause there's only one wish on my list It's a kiss underneath the mistletoe Won't you make my holidays and I'll have all the way to miss you To a chocolate, rosy cheeks I'm wearing my and my feet are floating off
