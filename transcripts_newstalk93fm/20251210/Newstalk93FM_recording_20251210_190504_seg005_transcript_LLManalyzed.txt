============================================================

Remember every time On these days that feel like you and me I break and I break free Do you ever think of me no I'm building my hopes up Like presents unopened till this day I still see the messages you read I'm foolishly patient Can't get past the taste of your lips Don't wanna let you out my head Just like the day that I met you The day I thought forever I said that you loved me
