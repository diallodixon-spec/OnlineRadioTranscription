2025-12-12 12:48:21 I'm not coming home tonight, not coming home tonight Don't sign me party, girl don't send no self party to find me I'm not going home tonight, not going home tonight I'm drunk in the party, so why don't you go self-party to find me? I know what's happening, melodies, nothing can take more of me And it makes my soul out of my chest so calm on, let's believe I don't know if I'll survive Some under, some wide, and some wide I go say shawl out with the light Because it's Christmas You.
