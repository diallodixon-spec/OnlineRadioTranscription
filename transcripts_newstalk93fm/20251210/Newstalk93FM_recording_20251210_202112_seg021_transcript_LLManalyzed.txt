============================================================

Real busybody never stay in one place And she knows I got more tricks under my sleeve That's why she never wants me to leave She tell me bad man see I need your love See I need your love Me need you close to me Me tell her see me or stay on the road Bad energy stay far away Make it stay far away Just gimme love for the night Gimme love for the night, yeah I waste no time Give me that love, give me peace of mind. I want that peace of mind.
