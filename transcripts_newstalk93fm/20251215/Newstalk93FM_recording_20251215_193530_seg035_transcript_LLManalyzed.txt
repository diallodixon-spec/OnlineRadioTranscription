20251215 193530 My friend, it was a misunderstanding So I thought you'd forget it Then I promised from today I'll go jump Like I never jump ways Like I never went flying Like I never went before Just to show you I'm sorry, I'm sorry And I need you back in my life Look at people by the truck Emotions running high We're up in the sky Just running down the high Can't you tell that we're sorry? We're sorry And we need you back and we're high I need the gold I need the world I need Even though I never wanna cheat, there's a thousand man on the street
