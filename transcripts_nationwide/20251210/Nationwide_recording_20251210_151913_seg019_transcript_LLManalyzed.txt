============================================================

Now I can't find the key without you And now your song is a repeat And I'm dancing on to your heartbeat And when you're gone, I feel incomplete So if you want the truth I just wanna be part of your symphony We hold me tight and I let go Symphony, like a love song on the radio We hold me tight, and I let go I'm sorry if it's up too much But every day you're here I'm healing And I was running out of love I never thought I'd find this feeling Cause I've been hearing symphonies Before all I heard was silence
