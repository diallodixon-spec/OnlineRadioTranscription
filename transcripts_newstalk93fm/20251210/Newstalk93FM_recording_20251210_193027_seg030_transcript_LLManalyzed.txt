I come from the twin island of the Calabas Oh Lord, it's we who create party And we love plente bacchanal Lord Lord So don't tell me nothing When still bad knocking And start the jam, jam, jam Me always kind rocking I feel it, the wine or something Inside the barn Every man go long to a woman I ain't fencing party So you know I'm a trinny I ain't fency party Everybody! Allez, allez, allez, allez! It's time to get up and start moving!
