20251226 160609 I'm ready, now you know daddy says it's a shame You robbing the cradle, but it's no game You say you're in love, and I know it's true They think I'm too young, but I love you too Girl, you know the love I have for you Is a love that's really pure and true You know that you're my guiding light When I've got you, everything is right I know my feelings been stronger more than before I know we on my feet, we just can't take no more I know my heart just a bubble and we can't take the trouble Ain't no minute here while you're in love with one here You've got the best of me
