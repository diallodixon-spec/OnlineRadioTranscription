20260102 115342 Father, we pause today to reflect in gratitude and your sustaining grace. And as we begin this new year, we come God seeking more of your divine presence in us, seeking more of your guidance and your will over our lives, seeking a closer walk with you, dear Father. Lord, if there's anything that we would desire for this year is that we become one with you. One in heart, in mind, body, and soul. One, O God, in obedience. One in unity with your Holy Spirit. The one whom you have left here to prepare us for your soon coming. And Lord, you instruct us as your disciples that we should not grieve the Holy Spirit by whom we are sealed unto the coming of our Lord. We thank you today that through the medium of your Holy Spirit we your children can come boldly before your throne of grace
