I love how you're moving We call that a slow wine Just gimme, just gimme, just give me Right now it is my time Don't tell me to join line All I it is waistline, waistline alone. Waistline, waistline! Waistline. Waistline alone. Move your hips to the waistline. Oh, girl, make it run, run, run. So right now, no waste time. I waste like no love. I'm the one to say no, right? We're fine. We're fine.
