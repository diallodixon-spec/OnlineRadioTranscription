Love down here so. How agriculture looks now. What about the farmers in Flagam man yeah down south field um all the way down we suffered a catastrophic blow to our culture sector yeah almost every single area so whether it be our peoples which have suffered significantly especially scotch money people um or yams we lost about 70 percent of that crop crop, or bananas where we lost 100% of commercial production.
