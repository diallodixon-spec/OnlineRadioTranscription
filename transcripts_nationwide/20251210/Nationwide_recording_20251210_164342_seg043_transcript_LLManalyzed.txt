In a while Enough things to talk about I'ma tell about my new man Safe from water house No be a big girl, not a rumor Human in my life See me ring finger, yeah, it's not a white But she's nearly upgrade from side chick N'femme to go dim off your wifey like I'm 10 to a read on What kind of can, guys? M5 jacked a bread letter inside You're too light Swear him about 6'5 Big bull tattoo fallin' bright on me But that's sunlight, my Yella, where your man come from? To New Kingston, which Kingston? We messin' with the same boy I swear I didn't know that we will see you
