20251223 132316 There's times when this dress rehearsal seems incomplete You see the colors in me like no one ever said Behind your dark glasses you're, you're something else And you're not going underneath it. We love you right on top. All boats all over. I thought once it said, baby, see me are ready for coming in. He said, no, wait, wait. You're coming in too early. I thought you were ready for me, man. Hello. Good afternoon to the two live listeners tuned in all across Jamaica and all across the world. It is a Tuesday. Talent Tuesdays. We call it got DJ Deli in the house. It's good to be here on a Tuesday.
