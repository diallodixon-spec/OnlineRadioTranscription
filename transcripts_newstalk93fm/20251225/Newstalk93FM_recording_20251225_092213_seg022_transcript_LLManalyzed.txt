20251225 092213 Christmas is you. You, baby. Oh, the lights are shining so brightly everywhere, baby. And I saw the children laugh and feel the air. And everyone is singing. I hear the sleigh bells ringing. Santa Santa won't you bring me the one I really need Won't you please come, baby, to meet me Oh, I don't want a life for Christmas This is all I'm asking for I just want to see my baby Standing right outside my my door. I just want you for my own, more than you could ever know. Make my wish come true. Baby, all I want for Christmas is you.
