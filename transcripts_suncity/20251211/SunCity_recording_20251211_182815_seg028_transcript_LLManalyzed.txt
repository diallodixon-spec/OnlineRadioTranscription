They are their own authentic self and it is because of their own authenticity that has led Business conglomerates for wanting to to do partnerships with them and they get these brand deals so i'll say to a lot of young people that you have to walk your own path it may look very glamorous etc as a casual onlooker but you have to be so convicted and so strong in who you are as a person and realize that opportunities though it may not look like x and y but the opportunities will also come in and coming in droves once you are as a person and realize that opportunities, though it may not look like X and Y, but the opportunities will also come in. And coming in droves, once you are authentically you and you have a firm, solid conviction as to who you are, the earnings will come. It may not look like brand deals, but certainly the opportunities will present themselves.
