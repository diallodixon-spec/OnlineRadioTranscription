Our willingness to work together, to stay the course, and to build back better for generations to come. Our motto is, out of many, one people, let us live these words, not only in speech, but in action. And as one people, let us live these words not only in speech but in action and as one people let us recover. As one people let us move forward. Move forward as we have done since independence. Jamaica has overcome countless challenges and we have never given up and we must not give up now. Let us stay together, work together, and build a stronger nation together for ourselves, our families, and those who will come after us. May God bless you.
