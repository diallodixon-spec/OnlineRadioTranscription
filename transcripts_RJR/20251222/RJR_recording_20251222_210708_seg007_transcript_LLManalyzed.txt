20251222 210708 My love, I can see beyond forever. Everything we own will never die. Love is such a beautiful thing. Oh, you make my world a summer day. I am just a dream to fade away. Nobody else too much ever, no one. It's much harder to come back. I'm waiting in line. Nobody needs too much loving love. It's as high as a mountain and harder to climb. You and me, girl.
