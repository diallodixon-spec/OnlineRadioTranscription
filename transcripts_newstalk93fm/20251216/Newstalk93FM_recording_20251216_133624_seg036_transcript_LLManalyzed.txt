20251216 133624 Forgive me, it sounds cocky He hypnotized me and opened my eyes Redwood tree, it ain't hard to see His love was the key that opened my skies Girls, I don't need to catch the bouquet To know a hard rock is on the way And baby, I'll admit I've been a little superstitious The curse on me was broken by your magic wand Knock on wood. It's you and me forever dancing in the dark. Over me, it's undisputed. I ain't got to knock on wood.
