20251216 135649 In my mind I see your pretty face One more night, give me just one more night Girl one more nights, cause I can't sleep without you Alright, cause everyday I say I want you in my life Cause I don't want you to wake if you know the devil inside I beg me, I beg you to apply this one on me Friday I'm well so cold without you and I'm feeling scared hiding I remember when you said you need me all day Make love from the room to inna the hallway, girl I don't fi learn the hard way Me no afraid fi say please girl stay One more night, give me just one more night Girl one more night, cause I can move without you
