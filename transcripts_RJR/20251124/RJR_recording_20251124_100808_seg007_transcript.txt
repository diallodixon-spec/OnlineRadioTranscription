You see, when I go out on the streets, I go anywhere. Taxi money is $3,000. I have to pay a taxi money to go to a place like that. $100, you know. And I came here and left, I have $3,000, and I have to go out both to look for a justice certificate to sign this life certificate thing. Well, you think the minister can't dash this life certificate thing? So, why do you think they can't dash it that way? But when it is just come, you know, when it is just again, they never have it, you know? Yeah. Go on it down and you just get a new book and things. Eh? No, they never have none. You have a little paper in the book and when the book is done, you sign on the paper and post it back.
