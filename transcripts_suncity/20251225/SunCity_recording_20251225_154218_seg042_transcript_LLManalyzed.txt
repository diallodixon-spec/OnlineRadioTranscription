20251225 154218 I remember when I gave up loving you My heart couldn't take no more of you I was sad and lonely I remember when I walked out I remember when I screamed I hated you But somehow deep inside still loving you Was sad and lonely No one knew All the pain I went through No! Right, right, right, right! Oh, where I would go, where I would be. But you made me leave. And plus, my heart, it just kept telling me so. Oh, I remember when my heart broke. I remember when I gave up loving you.
