20251217 190002 never directly hit by the storm. Secondly, however, cascading interactions require responses that target the intrinsic complexity of climate's impacts. We must think about climate in integrated cross-sectoral ways. Unless all sectors are strengthened together, the next storm will deliver losses of 30 to 40% of GDP. Not because, again, not because we fail to fix the most obvious weaknesses this time around, but because another overlooked downstream sector has become the new ignition point for devastation. In other words, in a cascading system, partial resilience equates to no resilience at all. So why are the SDGs on the screen? Because when climate impacts cascade, every single SDG comes under threat. If you try to circle which SDGs are affected by climate by tracing even the simplest linkages, you would end up circling them all, except maybe SDG 13 climate action. These are serious consequences because
