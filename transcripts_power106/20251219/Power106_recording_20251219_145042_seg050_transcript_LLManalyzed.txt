Charcuterie board starts at $5,000 and again they get discount from $500 to $1,000 of each board. Depending on the board of course. We also have some funny tokens like this one that says I'm trying to get in the holiday spirit but the bottle won't open and this one says dear Santa I was really good at being really naughty does that count I don't think it counts though all right so remind us where you're located again so just in case someone can't make it here today they can visit so we're at 9 Patrick Drive or you can go to our Instagram page it's time underscore season on season on the store garden on the score collection all right thank you so very much we'll be back all right so lots and lots of activities lots to sell lots to buy lots of conversation to be had let me make my way around here
