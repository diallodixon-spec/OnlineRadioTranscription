20260101 213223 deliverance passed by like a cloud. And now my life is poured out onto me. Days of misery have taken hold of me. At night I am in great pain. My pains do not take a rest. He seizes my clothing with great power. He grasps me by my tunic's collar. He has cast me into the dirt and I have become like dust and ashes. I cry to you for help, but you do not answer me. I stand, and you merely look at me. You have turned cruel to me. You persecute me with your hands' might. You lift me up to the wind. You make me ride it, and you toss me about in the storm. Indeed, I know that you will bring me to death and to the house of assembly for all the living. Surely someone must not send a hand against the needy, when in his misfortune there is a cry of help for them. Have I not wept for the unfortunate and grieved myself over the poor?
