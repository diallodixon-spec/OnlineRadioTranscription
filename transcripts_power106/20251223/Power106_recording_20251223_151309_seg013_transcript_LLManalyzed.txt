20251223 151309 I'm here. I would never turn my back on this country. But if you don't like it, don't spread propaganda on it. You don't have to agree what Trump is doing because I don't agree with everything Trump is doing. I'm socialist. I'm not a socialist. You could be what you want to be in America. Of course, during the past Trump administration, past Trump administration, this administration, you have gotten a little muddy, but it's still a democracy, which I love. It's still a capitalist which I love. You can be what you want to be. There's a lot of people running to this country because when they come here they can achieve something. And I want to say this. I thank God for America.
