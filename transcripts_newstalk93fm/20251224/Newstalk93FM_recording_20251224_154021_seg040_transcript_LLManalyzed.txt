20251224 154021 You just make me feel sweet, I stick cocoa tea, use the sugar And together we are complete, darling I've been patient, and I've been waiting Call me stubborn, but I can't get over it You left and never say goodbye Those tears I cried, no, I can get over it So don't you ever let me down again Cause I'm depending on you So you better come through this time Please hear my cry and if I ever let you down my friend
