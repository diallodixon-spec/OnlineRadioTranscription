You're living dangerously Girl, you're living too dangerously for me Girl you're living too dangerous Boy, better if you give it up Girl, you never stop until you pass the maximum line Well, do you do too much? I need a relationship and not a war. Imagine this young man in a man car. Tell me what the hell you gonna think of her? She a man that drink out of one glass in a bar. Make manner of things from me cookie jar. Girl, open up your eyes. The man look far. Have a look up to the moon and the pretty star.
