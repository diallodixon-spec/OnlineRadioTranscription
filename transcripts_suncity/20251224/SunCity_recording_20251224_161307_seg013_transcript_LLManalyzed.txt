20251224 161307 For you, there is no mountain I would not climb. No treasure I would not find. I'll turn the hands of time. For you, for you. I'll be the color for when you go. The one to have and own. I'll be there all the time for you. I'll be your friend, your company, your friend. I'll be there when you try to dry your eyes, keep you warm, chill.
