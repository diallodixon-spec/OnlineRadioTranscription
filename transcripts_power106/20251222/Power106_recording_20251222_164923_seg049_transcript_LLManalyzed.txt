20251222 164923 To every girl and boy But most of all Remember love Hear the sleigh bells ring Hear the chorus sing It's a time of joy and memories Friends and family decorate the Christmas tree While the children dream of toys in their sleeves Life is not the way it used to be We need to stop and remind ourselves of how it all would be Remember Santa Claus, remember all the toys
