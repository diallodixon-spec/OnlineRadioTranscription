20251224 130204 I just want you to come and ride it up Just a little winding out Come and meet me at the end of the truck and we rev it up The whole day Keep throwing it back at the way you stopped us Baby, no way We could boast of all the pictures you want When you're ready I could overshare knowledge You could overdo it But we could meet in the middle and start a bacchanal. Play in the middle here, what we gonna do now? Jam to a rhythm and eat a carnival. What we gonna do now, start a wine on it. I say compromise on it, baby spend time on it.
