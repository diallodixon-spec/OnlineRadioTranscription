I don't disrespect her. I want you to go get some public speaking courses and get comfortable speaking. I keep hearing people say that and I don't think her problem, I think that's one of her problems. But I think your ability to speak in public, I mean she's a two-time MP, she's Minister of Education, advisor to the Ministry of Finance initially, now Finance Minister. I don't think public speaking should be her issue. And if I'm to make a comparison between her and her predecessor, they are chalk and cheese. The other man was always prepared, always prepared to answer questions without having to refer to technocrats by his side. I even saw one time she was making a presentation to the Parliament and she had to get up from her seat and go to the back of the chamber to consult with technocrats before coming back to complete a presentation. That is a lack of preparation.
