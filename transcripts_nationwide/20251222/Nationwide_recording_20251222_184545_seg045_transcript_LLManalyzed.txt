20251222 184545 I think for 2025, we were having a very successful year, especially through the JME. We hosted a very successful Export Jamaica in April. We had over 230 companies showcasing over 3,000 Jamaican-made products and services, and we had over 879 buyers from over 25 countries. Manufacturing is the single largest contributor to exports, and even though our exports did fall in 2025, we saw the encouragement through Expo Jamaica and all of our international bios that were coming in that we thought that it was going to prove fruition in 2025.
