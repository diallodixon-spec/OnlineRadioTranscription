Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Nobody come in here to save you. You got to free yourself when you hear the freedom bell. And nobody in here could raise you. You could enjoy yourself when you feel the passion swell strong rum it is in the jamming but just like a kryptonite it beats in here all night i tell you how fun and tight it is we have it sweet woman we have it greatest on the planet boy love Playin' a song and it goes in a fuck And if I lose myself inside this place Well, I show my shit up If this hoes got unblast When the bitch up past the madness, what's up? Just give me one more shot inside my glass
