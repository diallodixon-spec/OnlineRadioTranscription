And I can't be without you baby I've been waiting up until you get home Cause I can't sleep without you baby With anybody who's out of love to know just what I feel Too hard to fake it, nothing can replace it I'm a radio if you just can't feel without you baby Oh, whoa, oh, hey, hey, hey. Oh, oh, oh, oh.
