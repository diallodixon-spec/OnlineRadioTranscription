So in a natural survey, it found that one in five persons living with HIV said they were afraid to go to a healthcare worker because they're afraid that they might be unfairly treated or that their status may be disclosed. And 16% of them delayed care because of a bad experience. So a human rights approach removes these barriers so that people can stay in treatment and live healthy. And what we do is to ensure that our healthcare providers are aware of what are the human rights and aware of the consequences if those rights of persons who access our services are violated. Perfect. Thank you for that. And then last question for you, Mrs. Russell, what message would you like to share with Jamaicans on Human Rights Day? So most importantly, as we observe World Human Rights Day, human rights are not just a concept. They are not up in the sky. They are the foundation of how we treat with each other on a daily basis.
