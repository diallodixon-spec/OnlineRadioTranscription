20251224 154223 The greatest pleasure in my life. Because when you're living by the moon, honesty, how we please, home is where the heart should be. Pretty feathers in disguise, not together we will rise. So don't you ever let me down again. Because I'm depending on you, so you better come through this time Please hear my cry and if I ever Let you down my friend It was a misunderstanding So if I took it for granted Then I promise I'm through there I go jump like I never jump Waved like I never wave. Run like I never won before. Just to show you I'm sorry. I'm sorry. And I need you back in my life. You got people by the truck. Emotions running high. We underpin the sky. Tears running down we eye. Can't you tell I'm inside?
