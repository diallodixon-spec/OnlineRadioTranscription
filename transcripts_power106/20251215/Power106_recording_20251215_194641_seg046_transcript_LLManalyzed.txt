20251215 194641 auditors and are being kept up to date. And by early next year, our audited financials for 2025 will be available. So the financial stability and foundation and strong administrative governance processes are some of the key things, including juniors concentrating on our younger players, women's concentrating on our young girls and our female players and and strengthen our coaching platforms so that the players get regular coaching from from us here, to give us a rest on what the Chess Federation will be doing. Thanks for being here, sir. Thank you.
