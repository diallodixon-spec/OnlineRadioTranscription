Yesterday, and a couple of my friends at my watering hole called me and said, then what's the big deal? To me, it's a big deal. Yesterday, it was announced that the Prime Minister was leaving the country to go into official business in New York. I hear all the media houses carry it with no qualification. What is the official business? You are going to meet Trump, you are going to meet, I don't know, Mamdani, for instance. What's the official business? No word from all the office of the Prime Minister say, traveling to the gun, Babsie in charge. That in itself should bring alarm bells, but never mind. So, I'm asking no answer. Well eventually I one of the members of the task force is Marlon Morgan who as you know is a regular caller to this program. So I say what is the official business? They say well I'll have to get back to you or not.
