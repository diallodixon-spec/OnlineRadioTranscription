2025-12-12 13:59:03 So where are you now calling me? I'm in Blue Mountain. I'm doing some sorrel now because I'm a sorrel farmer. It's almost Christmas now so I'm doing sorrel right now. What do you have? The red or the white one? I have the white one and the red one. But I don't plant much of the white one because people don't really go for that one. No sir, I don't want the white sorrel. Sorrel for red. Yeah, so I'm doing the red one mostly. So you're in Blue Mountain. What about coffee? No, no, this is not Blue Mountain in Kingston. This is Blue Mountain in Manchester. It's a few miles out of Manchester. Oh, okay. Okay. Well, thank you for the call. All the best to you. Have a great weekend. You too. Take care. Mrs. Fuller. Good afternoon, Mrs. Shields. Hi. How are you? Good afternoon Mrs. Shields, I greet you well. And you too. I am so proud of you and the wealth of experience that you have. I would say you are a learned lady. Well, I don't know about that, you know, but who am I talking to? My name is Parker E. from Marlborough, Manchester.
