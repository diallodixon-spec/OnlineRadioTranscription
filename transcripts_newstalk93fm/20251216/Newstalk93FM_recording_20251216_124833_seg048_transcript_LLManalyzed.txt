It's is everlasting How it gets so normal How it's so comfortable for sleep Man a disc that don't want to wake up the devil I know me Me no response to what do wrongs Me no in my heat Rather sing songs and do the right Who no listen to me I know better It not easy time testing but i'm strong with love on my mind loving my thoughts carrying on why nobody no believe in a love again because every love that lost nobody
