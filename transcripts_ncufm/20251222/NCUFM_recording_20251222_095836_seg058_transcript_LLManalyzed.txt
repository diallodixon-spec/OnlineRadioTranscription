20251222 095836 Alright everyone, calm down now. What kind of bomb do we have in there? It looks like a Delta IV design, sir, using a Class V explosive. Have you evacuated the area? Ten city blocks, sir. We'd better deactivate this bomb immediately. How much time do we have? We can't tell. The timer has no display. What? Really? Yes. That bomb can go off any second. Well, yeah, that's true. But on the same token, it could take days for that bomb to go off. Well, yeah. I wish you would have told me that on the phone. I could have finished my dinner. I'm sorry, sir, but I thought we should deal with this right away. No, no. Let's go home, get a good night's sleep, and come back tomorrow. Sir, we don't know when that bomb will explode.
