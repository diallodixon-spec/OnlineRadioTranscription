20251226 173926 Willingness forever to fight And be strong Once it's for better I'll write her a letter And move and ride along And I'll roll with the punches Accept changes Work with the formula Do what I have to do And call me by my name I am ready to roll Once the rules remain the same How the story's been told Call me anytime Never got out Liarness is on the rise Don't you ever have doubt When you are willing to serve We have room to observe To see if you can walk the walk you took Let me give you my word My voice must be heard
