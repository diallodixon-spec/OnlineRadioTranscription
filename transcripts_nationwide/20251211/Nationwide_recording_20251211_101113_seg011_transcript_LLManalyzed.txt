============================================================

Thank you very much for that report there, Siobhan. Now, some of the findings here give for wild reading, particularly that point there highlighted by Siobhan, a bank error in January 2025. In the nation's parliament, of course, in the backroom office, this is not unfolding on the floor of the parliament. This is talking about the system that undergirds the operations of the nation's parliament. And those systems need to be robust. The parliament and the function of the parliament are way too significant for it to be underpinned or undergirded by weak and inefficient systems. and to read that a bank error in January 2025 resulted in nearly $30 million being transferred to the credit card account instead of the $181,000 requested.
