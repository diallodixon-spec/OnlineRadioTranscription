20251212 141614 They never tell us they're in trouble when they trouble ya. Somebody couldn't tell us. We say TPS and we a turn over the map. Everybody vex over when me never said them, said me need to show more respect to the dead. Me no understand where some man a man a meds, but me just couldn't put no buggies na my head. All of a sudden, everybody turn me up. A couple of girls said they pregnant with me out. Some men that said they used to send me gone school, and they used to buy me chips and bagged juice. It's been too long, they've lived for my name still. I'm listening to the song, they want my name still. Yeah, yeah. I just want to make it clear, so we are in the same still. Move up one on the start, fuck with the same still move up on the start on the chain still. We are not the city city city. One of the gen of them. No, we don't fit me quietly. We run the place I envy them to give me. One time I never took care but I'm up to keep. No matter how good we feel, we think because of nothing. They never tell you nothing. Trouble when they're troubling you. Somebody couldn't tell you stay away from us. We say keep your soul away, turn over again.
