2025-12-12 12:31:34 As I speak, tents are being delivered to schools. We have been providing them with topolins that we got from our sponsors and so we are ensuring then that the remaining schools that are not open, that they will be opened. We have seven primary schools that have not been opened and so we have been supporting them. Additionally, we want to ensure that for those schools that reopened and were not fully resumed, that they will be able to do so come January. Susan Nelson-Smith, Director of Regional Educational Services in the Education Ministries, Region 5. Meanwhile, Nelson-Smith says work is being done to minimize learning loss across Region 5. With the schools being reopened, the fact that more than 80% of the schools are reopened, you know, that is something that I must applaud our principals for. For those students now where we are concerned about their learning loss, we have what is called the Child Find Initiative. This is led by our guidance and counseling unit.
