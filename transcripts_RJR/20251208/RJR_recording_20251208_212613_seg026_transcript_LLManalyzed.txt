What's this magic that I feel inside? So excited when I'm close to you. When I'm touching you, I can feel it come alive, hypnotized by what's inside of you. Ooh, we're just strangers, and we know each other. I'm so glad we found each other. Love is where you find it. Put your heart inside it. Say, there's no rhyme or reason.
