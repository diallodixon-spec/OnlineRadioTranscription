20251230 162111 Marcia got it locked in, I love in these songs, I pick up a sip of Marcia. we could go anywhere I see you smiling, the love we are just ending. You make me wanna run, run, run. Heart beat racing like a drum from drum. Feel it in my soul. Leave me wanting more. Hey, you make me wanna run run run. Heart beat rising like a drum.
