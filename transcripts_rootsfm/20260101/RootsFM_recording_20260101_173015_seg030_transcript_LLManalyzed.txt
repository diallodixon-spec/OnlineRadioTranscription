20260101 173015 The rapper. But when you come out of the water I'm a believer, my heart is fleshy Life is short with a temper like Joe Pesci They always come and sing your praises, your name is catchy But they don't see you how I see you Parley and Desi, cross-twee-twee, messy Get the jet speed, when they get messy, go lefty like Lionel Messi Let's take a trip and get the Vespers or Rinicheski I know the spots have got the best weed. We going next week. I wanna, I wanna honor you. Rise grown, I'm my father's child. Honor when the sun takes the first step, the father's proud. If you make it to the water, it'll part the clouds. I know he made you a snack like Oscar Proud. Suffer it to be so now gotta clean it up for me.
