There is indeed a place for man in Christ Jesus where we must make the change. That's where we have a lot of problem. People going to church and in the world, having one foot in the church and one foot in the world. God is calling us to make a serious decision and whatsoever the consequences are, you must stand by that decision. Make an honest effort to live that life. It is a life that will live for Jesus that will be a shining. Jesus said it in his word John 14 and verse 15 if he loved me keep my commandment this they may know that you are my disciple if you keep my commandment it is the love of God hallelujah in our heart according to John for he has shed his love in our heart hallelujah
