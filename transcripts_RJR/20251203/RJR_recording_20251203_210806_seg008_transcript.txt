As you give thanks to the father. Come on, down, down. Cause it's just another day. And we have to come through till we make it. Just another day, another day. When me talk, me no apologetic. Now put me mouth to ground. When me talk me no apologetic, when me talk, now put me mouth to go. We don't apologize, we don't apologize. I beg you, try to hold your office down, they wanna win. Nobody wanna be themselves, they know they wanna be.
