Customs' job is to protect the borders, collect revenue, and to facilitate trade. Them not collect or store shipment, them inspect it, and somebody off-represent it for inspection. Tracy, and the customs alone involved in the clearance process, you know? Even though it's them we tend to talk about. Look at it this way. Shipment delayed? Talk to your airline agent. Missing items? Talk to your freight forwarder. The charges surprise you now. Call customs. But remember to collect your sign and stamp declaration or C number from your agent. So when you call customs, they can better help you. We're never too old for learning. Some of us know it all. What when customs won't hire item them now? You mean detain it? But that's only for restricted or prohibited items Tracy. And in such case, make sure you get a notice of detention for the rest of your life.
