St. and the Grenadines is moving ahead with plans to launch a citizenship by investment CBI program, signaling a major shift in its economic strategy. Deputy Prime Minister Major St. Clair Leacock said on local radio that the initiative will play a key role in driving economic transformation, creating jobs and helping to meet the basic needs of citizens. He described the program as a tool the country must and will use to stimulate growth. The move marks a clear break from the previous administration. Former Prime Minister Ralph Gonzalez strongly opposed the CBI programs throughout his 24 years in office. But the New Democratic Party, which won 57% of the vote in November, sees CBI as a strategic opportunity. If implemented, St Vincent and the Grenadines would join Dominicub, Antigua and Barbuda, St Kitts and Nevis, St Lucia and Grenada in offering citizenship.
