20260101 201310 I dream about just holding you like that What is a girl supposed to do? I want you, I want you I want you You're the one that I live for And I can't take it anymore I love you, I love you I need you, I need you Can I just make you see You're the only one for me Oh The lines I drew before you walked into my life I was the type to never walk for nothing I try hard to make some sense again
