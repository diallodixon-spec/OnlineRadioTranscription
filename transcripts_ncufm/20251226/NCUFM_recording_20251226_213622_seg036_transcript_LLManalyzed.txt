20251226 213622 Jesus from the Father's own right hand Jesus Son of God and Son of Man Jesus Who died and rose again Jesus He's the lion and the lamb. Who is He with a power none can tame? Who is He that every foe would fear His name. Who is he who was hardly led away to suffer that dark day? His name is Jesus.
