Together. This time is forever. We'll be fighting, but forever will it be. So to be in love, we will never be uncommon again. And whatever I said, whatever I did, I didn't mean it. I just want you back for good. See you on to back for good. But I'm sorry if I'm going to talk in the street again. Say you want me back for good.
