20251224 095538 God from age to age Though the earth may pass away Your word remains the same Your history can prove There's nothing you can't do You're faithful and true Though the storms may come And the winds may blow I'll remain steadfast And let my heart learn. When you speak a word, it will come to pass. Great is your faithfulness to me. Oh, great is your faithful name. From the rising sun to the setting sun, I will praise your name.
