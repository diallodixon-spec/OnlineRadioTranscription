20251216 130404 I'm telling you I love whenever you bring a vine With your hands them up in the sky Watch me drunk and having a time Carnival time again And we have all money to spend And we go right down to the end Watch me with me cannibal friend Them, them me cannibal friend, friend, friend. Oh, yeah. Hannibal friend. Yeah. Hannibal friend until we meet up again. Ah! Until we meet, meet, meet. Rumble beat, beat, beat. Things so sweet, sweet, sweet. Feel complete, cause we love each other. With your hands them up in the sky. Rolling back and having a time.
