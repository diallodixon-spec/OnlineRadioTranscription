============================================================

Disappointment comes with a lesson It's for me to get wiser, got to work harder In the end, it will get better Lord, I thank you for sunshine, thank you for rain Thank you for joy, thank you for pain It's a beautiful day, it's a beautiful day. It's day by day. You can't have faith and don't want to work. Get up off that seat and put that brain to work.
