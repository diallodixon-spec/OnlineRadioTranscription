20251222 171010 I can't get over it. So don't you ever let me down again. Because I'm depending on you, so you better come through this time. Please hear my cry, and if I ever let you down, my friend, it was a misunderstanding. So if I took it for granted Then I promise from today I'll go drunk like I never drunk Waved like I never waved Wired like I never won before Just to show you I'm sorry, I'm sorry And I need you back in my life Look at people by the truck Emotions running high We are not in the sky Taste running down we high Can't you tell that we sorry? We sorry And we need you back in we life I need you back on the road
