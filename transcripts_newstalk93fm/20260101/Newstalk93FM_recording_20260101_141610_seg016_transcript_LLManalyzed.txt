20260101 141610 Hey, hey, hey, hey You don't like the fast life But look on the bright side, girl I go take the blame I just want you to come and rise it up Just a little ride in the house Come and meet me in the truck and we rev it up Say hold it, keep throwin' it back I know why you stop, close up Baby no way. We could post up all the pictures you want when you're ready. I go over here, darling. You go over there. But we could meet in the middle and start a back and all. Play in the middle, baby. What we gonna do now? Jam to a rhythm. We hit a carnival. Play in the heat baby. What we go do now? Start a whine on it. I say compromise on it. Baby, spend time on it. I said compromise on it.
