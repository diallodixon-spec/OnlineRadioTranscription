20260101 150002 This is my message to you, boo-boo. There's no worry about a thing. But every little thing gonna be all right. I'm just this morning Smile with the rising sun Three livin' birds Bit by my doorstep Singin' sweet songs Of melodies pure and true Singin' This is my message to you Love and hate
