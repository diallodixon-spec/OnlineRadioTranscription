20251224 145644 bill adjustment of approximately $655 on the previous bill of about $9,000. The OUR in approving this adjustment notes that given the scale of the disaster, it may take up to six months for electricity generation costs to stabilize and for energy consumption to normalize. Given the likelihood that further adjustments could cause bill shock to customers, the OUR has urged JPS to discuss the IPP and fuel charges with the OUR before they are applied over the next six months. The OUR has emphasized that the objective is to ensure a gradual, manageable recovery while avoiding additional bill shock for customers. Speaking at a press conference on December 16, Minister of Energy, Telecommunications and Transport, the Honorable Daryl Vaz commended the OUR for its transparency in the handling of this matter.
