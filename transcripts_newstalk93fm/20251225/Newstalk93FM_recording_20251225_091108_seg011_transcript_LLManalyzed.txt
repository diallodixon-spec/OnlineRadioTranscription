Why don't you need traffic jam? Girls, right and left. Monday morning, alighter, Tuesday evening, alighter. Bump out the fender, traffic jam, bump out the fender. Traffic jam. Monday morning, a lighter, Tuesday evening, a lighter. Bump out a fender, traffic jam. We ain't going nowhere, we ain't going nowhere Like we ain't leaving this place We ain't going no where, we not leaving this place Anybody fix, tell them fly over We jamminming all on the shoulder. Y'all listening, moving closer. Send your bumper right over. Then drop it lower. Then walk it slower. Watch me in your review mirror. Go, go, go! Y'all, you are the greatest. You'll always be my friend.
