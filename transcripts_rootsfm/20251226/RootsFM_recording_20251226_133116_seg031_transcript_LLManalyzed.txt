20251226 133116 difficult staying focused. I'm located in Black River St. Elizabeth. My workshop is in my family home so I live and work in the same place and during the storm we lost part of our roof and then the door to my workshop actually came straight off so I have experienced some damage to my equipment and some of my materials and it's just been hard to see the destruction all around me, but I'm trying to just keep moving forward. We still have to try and make money, we still have to make our path outside of the disaster and keep going. So yes, coming to this event was really important for me to remind myself that I can keep going to kind of prove, I guess, my strength and my ability to move past the disaster in a way, although it's still hard. We're all just going to have to find a way forward. Resilient jeweller in St.
