The schools remain closed. Responding to questions during a meeting of the Standing Finance Committee of Parliament on Tuesday, Williams says 59 of the schools are serving as shelters for persons displaced by the hurricane. Williams says of the 1,010 public schools across the country, 721 were damaged by the hurricane and 850 schools have reopened. The government has allocated $616 million to carry out clean-up exercises in schools after the storm. She says some $1.7 billion have been set aside in the third supplementary estimates for public schools for the period ending March 31, 2026.
