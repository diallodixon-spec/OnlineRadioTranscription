============================================================

super hard to do the same work as the other one. The other one, now, you will have to work it super hard. You're going to burn more fuel to get it done. And I'm just going to give you some examples, because some persons may want to know, what does he mean by working it super hard? For instance, you're going up the North Coast Highway. You notice that steep hill right there. You, with your non-turbocharged engine, will probably have to go down into probably third speed to go over that hill at a reasonable speed, correct? The turbocharged one you may not even have to gear down. You can probably go over that hill without even coming going into a lower gear. You probably could be in fifth speed and still going over that hill, at a good speed, your other one, your non-turbocharged car, way down at the bottom of the hill while you're still climbing and pulling a load at that. Yes, and then you know, so I may have to floor my pedal now to get up here.
