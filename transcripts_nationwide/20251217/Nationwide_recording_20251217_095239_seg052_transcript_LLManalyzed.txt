20251217 095239 and it should be back by 6 p.m. the NWC is saying I just saw another one but I am trying to click the the the advisory but it's not opening on the NWC's website however it's advising of an operational issue impacting operations in Victoria Town at the Victoria Town facility in Manchester. As I said, you can definitely go onto the NWSE's website and check that out. And I think it's the same for JPS as well. I think JPS does put out advisories, especially now with the Hurricane Melissa recovery efforts, they are doing their best to inform the public of their recovery efforts and the areas that they are planning to restore.
