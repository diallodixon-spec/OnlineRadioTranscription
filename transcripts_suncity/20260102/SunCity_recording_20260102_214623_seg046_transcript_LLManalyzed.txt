I ain't in a jeep like staggered up. Me clean on my back a rattle. Keep dem nose low, God. Me do it naturally. Nugger girl, I run me down fast like a Charlie. But when some me shut, I'm a sashie. Don't know the pay, they know the code. Me know it. It's when you know me, yeah, ma. Yeah, it's it. It's it, yeah, it't have to talk. See, they have to be savvy, they're not D.A.B.I.T.A. I'm a big character, but me, I'm topical, I have to cash. I'm stuck in a mobius.
