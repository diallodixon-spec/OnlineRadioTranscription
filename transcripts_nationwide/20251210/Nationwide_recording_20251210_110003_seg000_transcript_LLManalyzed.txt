============================================================

And I went to the guy that said look, I'm making a different application, right? The fact that it's been so long and I didn't get a reply so the guy goes to me. Oh, you can't make an application unless you stop the review. You have to stop the review application first. And I'm like, no, after six, seven years, I can't stop it. Anyway, he told me that so I didn't submit the application at the time. I didn't. They don't want me to come back and call certain people and certain people. No, don't stop, don't stop it. Yes. Right? And I called, and when I called, the same answer they give me, it's still at the ministry. And I'm like, for six years, it's at the ministry, and I'm like, really? What is it doing at the ministry so long? I asked the guy, I said look it may end up in the file turret in some way there along. So I said to him, I said to him I'm trying to make a new application and he goes no you can't make it out but you have to cancel it, you have to do it first. And I'm like, oh, is it still alive? I said, I'm like, is the appeal still alive? Yes. He said, yes, but it take time.
