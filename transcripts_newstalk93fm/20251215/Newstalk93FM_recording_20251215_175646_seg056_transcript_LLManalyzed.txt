20251215 175646 No matter where I go, I'm not leaving. I said I'm not leaving Jamaica. Not at all. I could have never left Jamaica. In comes King Kabaka, lyrical champion. Watch me chop up the rhythm like a sword from Japan. So bright and full swing like a real Chinese man. Practitioner of yoga but not Indian. Lyrics them a weapon of mass destruction. Me have nuclear bomb like an American. Can't overstand like an Egyptian. Okay. And then sip a cup of tea like I come from England. A long time I'm a DJ in a dance. A long time, I'm a chant in a dance. I come from the nice of the area. I come from nice of Jamaica. I want you to just dance off the top. Dance off the top. Lick off the top. George, you want some love.
