20251224 142513 I've been around long enough I know when it's a danger place, place, place And I am man enough I can tell you in front your face, face, face I said I am strong enough I know to pull my own weight And I love Jaina I know how to hold my faith All right then you can't fake your real true life like a show You fool some people but some people will know say you a fraud Fake, now make the mistake and go give them any power to determine your fate and Give them a inch and they'll take a yard Give them a yard and they'll give you a bit of clad But, are you fi careful how you step? Now work fi regret And make sure you shuffle in the deck cause I will never go dancing
