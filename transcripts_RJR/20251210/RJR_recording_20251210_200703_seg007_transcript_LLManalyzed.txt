Sharing my love through the night Time up! I'm restless I can't sleep going Can't live without your love I'm restless I Can't sleep going I can't Live without your love I tried to fight it Tried to hide it Of another passing flame Well, here today and gone tomorrow But with you, the fire raged Over my mind, body and soul, baby You took complete control On the verge of going crazy,azy, you're all I want Don't you leave me in the cold I'm restless I can't sleep for week Can't sleep without your love I'm restless
