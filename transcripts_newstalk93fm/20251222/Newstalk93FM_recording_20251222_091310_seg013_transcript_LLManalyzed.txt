20251222 091310 Said I'm falling, falling, I'm falling As I lay my bed with my head to the ceiling Say I'm drowning alone and I'm lost in my feelings Somebody send me a sign cause you know that I need it Can't even come and show me love. Wind up on show me love. Together, say we all need love! Jump up, and show me love! Wind up on, show me love! Suck and make me shun that truth!
