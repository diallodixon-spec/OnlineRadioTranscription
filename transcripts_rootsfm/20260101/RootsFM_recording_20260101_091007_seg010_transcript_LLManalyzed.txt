20260101 091007 Some boy we are no brother, much less my relatives They don't want to see me, they don't go check Now I will live the life like we in a movie She tell her she narrate me, say that I fool me Oh you see this pretty girl, we're bad and bougie Alright, so me can't do it, you would me approve it Me never fight a war, in a life I lose it Man a G in a game, bad mine, excuse me Girl we're pretty, girl we're bad and budget I don't use a jib over me neck Chup, chup, chup Almost even me call out all the, how are you? I am fine.
