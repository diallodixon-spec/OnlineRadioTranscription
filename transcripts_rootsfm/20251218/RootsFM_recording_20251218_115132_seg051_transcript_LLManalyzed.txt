20251218 115132 randomly. So I need to know who is this. So I said to the person, the laws of the land give me no permission to give you my information. And I refuse to give you information. So that's a start of scamming. We understand. Persons are using different methods. Somebody gonna text my phone. We love gossip and love to hear. Somebody text my phone yesterday. Who is this? I turned to the person and said I didn't text you. When I told the person I didn't text them, the person turned to me and said that they were looking through their phone and they saw my number. And I should give them my information who I am. No, I am not going to give them my information just randomly like that because I want to find out who that person is now. And that's a form of scam.
