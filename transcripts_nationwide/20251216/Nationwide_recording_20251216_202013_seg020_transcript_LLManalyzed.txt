20251216 202013 do believe that many persons do not understand the knee and I'm talking about especially non-medical persons George and so it is difficult for them to even understand why they feel pain and how they feel. So for this program we're going to talk about the knee as a structure and just before you go into that I just want to add this to you before you go that there was a a footballer at Manchester United a guy named Owen Hargreaves he he won the Champions League with Manchester United. But his career ended early, very early thirties, because he had a situation, Doc, where the cartilage in his knee, he received several knee injuries over time, the cartilage in the knee was gone, and he said that the reason he was feeling debilitating pain, he said he felt like a cripple could hardly get out of bed, was because when went to the surgeon in Colorado the surgeon said sir your knee is so badly damaged what we're having is bone rubbing on bone because the cartilage is gone that sounds like the most painful thing in the world yeah yeah so talk to us about the structure of this
