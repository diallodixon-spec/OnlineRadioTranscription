So can you sue someone who promised to sell you a house, but they changed their mind? If there's nothing in writing, and no money is exchanged, and you can't sue them, when it comes to land transactions, for them to be binding, and it's an ancient, ancient, ancient law, you need to have something in writing. Oral agreements when it comes to the land are not binding. So if someone simply sold to you, you're not able to sell this land to you. And then they change a man and they went and they sold it to someone else. Sorry, there's nothing you can do. You won't be able to sort this through, you won't be successful because you wouldn't have anything in writing. And the second part of your question is, can I put a cave yet to prevent them from selling to someone else? You wouldn't be successful with a caveat. For one, you don't have anything. You don't have any documentary evidence. So if all they said, if all that you have is, you know, a conversation to say, hey, I'm selling this property to you. That's not enough.
