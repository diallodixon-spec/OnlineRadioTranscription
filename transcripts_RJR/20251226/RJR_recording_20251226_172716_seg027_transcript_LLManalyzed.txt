20251226 172716 It was not difficult. It's scary. It's scary as hell. What was scary about it? I like to say a tin can. A lot of people don't use that analogy. But I like to say you're in a tin can going 150 kilometres and all. Not only about padding or anything like that. Just you holding yourself in and, you know, having faith that the driver do what he needs to do to get us down. And then when in surface stop, you know, you pull the brakes and make sure the sled stop before, you know, I get to a place where anybody may get hurt. So it is a scary sport, but it's fun. I can imagine. High adrenaline. No, in the movie Cool Runnings, we saw there was an element or aspect there when everybody was trying to psych up themselves.
