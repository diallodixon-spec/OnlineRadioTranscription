2025-12-11 17:12:30 The energy minister yesterday said that the only proposal that is before the government from the JPS is for 150 million dollars. The JPS has said they need 350. Where's that money going to come from? Only time will tell. It's a fluid situation and it is where it is because the minister himself said yesterday that he hasn't received a full breakdown of what is required either from the JPS or the Office of Utilities Regulation, OUR. Bearing that in mind, when will he get that full breakdown? How will it affect timelines going forward, especially as it relates to assessments that need to be done by the multilaterals and the ability of the GPS to raise that 200 million additional?
