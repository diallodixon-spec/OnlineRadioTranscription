Look at it this way. Shipment delayed. Talk to your airline agent. Missing items? Talk to your freight forwarder. The charges surprise you now. Call customs. But remember to collect your sign and stamp declaration or C number from your agent. So when you call customs, they can better help you. We're never too old for learning. Some of us know it all. What when customs won't allow you to item them now? You mean detain it? But that's only for restricted or prohibited items, Tracy. And in such case, make sure you get a notice of detention for the restricted and seizure notice for the prohibited. The information there all over them social media pages and them websites, Tracy. We have to stay informed as a people, you know, and know your customs. Them, they have to help and protect all of you. Know your customs. Visit the Jamaica Customs Agency's website.
