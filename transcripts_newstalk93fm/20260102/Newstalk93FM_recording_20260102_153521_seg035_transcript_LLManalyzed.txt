20260102 153521 It's been a hell of a ride But every single moment You were there by my side Whenever I'm broken You make me feel low Whenever I'm lonely You're there for my soul Wherever you are, girl, that's where I call my own Whenever you doubt it, I'll be letting you know Girl, I want to be dancing with you forever You see through the storm and take me as I am Baby, it's magic anytime that we're together I make I just love you and hold you for my hand Hold you for my hand
