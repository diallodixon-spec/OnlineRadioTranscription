2025-12-11 18:29:03 honor distinguished Jamaicans, Martha Bernard, Dr. Audrey Hinscliffe and Carl Bradshaw for their service to national development. And finally in netball, the Jamaican mid-court star Kalisa Williams says the national senior women's netball team has settled in Nigeria since arriving in England for their two match of Vitality Rules Horizon series against the hosts on December 13 and 14 at the Copper Box Arena. The Sunshine Girls traveled to England on December 8 after the Jamaican leg of the series was postponed due to widespread disruptions caused by Hurricane Melissa. Despite a few minor health hiccups within the squad, Williams says, the players are in good spirits and ready to hit the court. We've been doing a good job in terms of trying to get climatized. A couple of illnesses here, no one dare. I think we're getting over it. I think we are gelling well as a unit. It's for us to know better what it is that we have. We are prepared to play.
