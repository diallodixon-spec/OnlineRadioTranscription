Yesterday, I heard Simon interview Damian and I don't want to talk too low because I don't know if I hear properly. Didn't the Minister of Finance said don't worry about the 150 million because money industry is JPS? As if to say they tell her that X money was, she said that. Well, if you listen to the discussion between Simon and Damian, no truth. So we want to know who is in charge. Yeah man.
