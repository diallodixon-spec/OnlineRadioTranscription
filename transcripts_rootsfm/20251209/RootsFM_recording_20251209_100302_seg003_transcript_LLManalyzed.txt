============================================================

Since the beginning of modern civilization, generations have witnessed and inherited the only conflicts of world wars. But behold, the marriage supper of the lamb and bridegroom unto his bride. Then shall the earth's children know the true expression of one land. Then mother earth shall honeymoon in peace. Forever eliminating aspirations, lust and anguish of wars and rumors of wars. See how the innocent grew it up in fables, and broke the under-spreadin' into dissonant papers. Not even Superman would have saved him in the gatehouse. Better judge, better place.
