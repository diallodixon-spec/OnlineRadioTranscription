20260101 120503 The new deadline rather the Ministry of Finance has announced a two-week extension for the relief from import duties and general consumption tax GCT on selected items donated in response to Hurricane Melissa. The new deadline is January 15, 2026. The extension follows the original announcement of October 30, which outlined relief measures for customs, duty and GCT on specified list of items until December 31. In explaining the extension, the Minister acknowledged that the Christmas season and intervening holidays constrained the capacity of shippers, freight forwarders, brokers and ports. It added that the decline in customs tax revenue since the hurricane is estimated at approximately $12 billion. The government warned that the relief period would not be extended further and urged those sending items to use normal import chances.
