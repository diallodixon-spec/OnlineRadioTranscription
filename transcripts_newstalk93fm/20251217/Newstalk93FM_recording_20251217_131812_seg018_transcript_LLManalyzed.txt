Let me be your woman. Woman, woman, woman. I can be your lady, I'm a woman, I'm a mother, but they got a problem. Put some babies in your life and take away the drama. Put the paper in the picture like a diorama. Gotta face a lot of people that are opposite. Cause the world told me we ain't got that common sense. Gotta prove it to myself that I'm on top of s**t.
