20251215 173717 to whosoever it is that ordered the expansion of Brayton Parkway, right? They're finally doing some road work, you know, expanding the road right in front of Sovereign Village, which honestly that road should have been expanded before anything built on, because it's a road, trust me, this road, the road that Portmore Pines Plaza is on, the road that Sun City is on, this road needed to be expanded years ago, like a million years ago. This road has always had traffic, so it's good to see that they're finally expanding. A part of the road, it's not even all of the road, just a portion of the road, but it's still better than what we currently have. So thank you to the powers that be. Big up yourself. And we look forward to you expanding the rest of the road really, really, really soon. But what you're doing right now will alleviate a lot of pressure.
