20251226 144539 I'm up above the things you do so well You're right in front of us, so it's time for the shine I don't like the way he's looking at you I can start everything you want him to Am I crazy, have I lost you? Even though I know you love me, can't I help it? I turn my chill music up And I'm working my chest I'm getting ready to face you You can call me insane It's not your fault that they hurt me Call'm in no disrespect It's my right to be punished I still can't get back You're too sexy beautiful Everybody wants a taste That's why I can't get back
