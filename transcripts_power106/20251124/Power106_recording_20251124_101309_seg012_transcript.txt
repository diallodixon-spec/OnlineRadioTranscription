What what what what a hurricane can do what it has done and We should have been you know more prepared and if we were better prepared Damage would have been less right and Not also the damage would have been less but even? And not also the damage would have been left, but even now, as we're talking about the pace that they're going, the pace could have, you know, been accelerated. We are getting a lot of assistance, right? We are getting a little bit of assistance from overseas. That is why it is going, but if we in Jamaica were better prepared, and I'm talking about government and all these other agencies, then we could have been moving faster in the restoration. Thank you, Chris. Thank you very much, Chris.
