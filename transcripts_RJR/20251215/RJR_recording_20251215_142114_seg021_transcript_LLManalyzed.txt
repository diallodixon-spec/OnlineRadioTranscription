20251215 142114 Working so hard From weak I've been anticipating Just to take my day off Because life, it can be amazing If you just pass here, man, set Leave a little, breathe a little and go on and join in Cause the remote can make a make it No bother watch it trickle cause things so wild All I wanna do is leave a little Breathe a little and go and join in 94.5 As long as the moon will light you up, you're alright You know everything alright You know you're going alright
