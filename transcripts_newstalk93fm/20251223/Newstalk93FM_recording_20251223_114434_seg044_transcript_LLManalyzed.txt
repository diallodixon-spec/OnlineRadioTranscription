20251223 114434 I tell it to you I love whenever you bring a vine With your hands them up in the sky Watch we drunk and having a time Cannibal time again And we have all money to spend And we go right down to the end Watch me with me cannibal friend Them, them sweet. Feel complete, cause we love you back and now. Beat, beat, rumble beat you bring a vibe. We chance them up in the sky. Rolling back and having a time.
