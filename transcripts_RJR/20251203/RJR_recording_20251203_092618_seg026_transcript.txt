Mr. Azan Constancy and the one that Wavelines is now produce more tough than St. Elizabeth. The problem that we have, we keep on electing these people who does not pay any attention to the basic farming areas. In places like Mockney, Wreckford, Sparlins and all those places, these guys must paid more emphasis on it. The last time I went up the hill, I was surprised to see what the youths are doing up there. Most of the area that I know used to provide us with cabbages and lettuce and pop chow and tomatoes is all in bush and all that I've seen the guys doing is smoking ganja and drinking specials. You're all over the place now. Thanks for your comments. Respect. Let me take the next one.
