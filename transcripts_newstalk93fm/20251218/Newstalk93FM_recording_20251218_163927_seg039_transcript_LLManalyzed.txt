20251218 163927 Every joke's just trolling and memes, sad as it seems. Apathy is hot, everybody's cut throat in the comments. Every single hot take is cold as ice. When you found me, I said I was busy, that was a lie. I have been afflicted by a terminal uniqueness. I've been dying just from trying to seem cool But I'm not the baddest And this isn't savage But I'm never gonna let you down I'm never gonna leave you out So many traitors, smooth operators But I'm never gonna break that bow I'm never going to leave you now, now
