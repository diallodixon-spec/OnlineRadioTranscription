20251223 090104 Girl, how do you know about customs? Lisa, stop going like you don't have any sense, man. You don't see everybody talk about it in the media? You don't want to stop listening to hearsay? You ever experience that? Customs don't go into your package, suitcase, barrel or cargo unless you ship the item or the agent stand up right there when they inspect it. Listen, customs job is to protect the borders, collect revenue and to facilitate trade. Them not collect or store shipment, them inspect it and somebody offer presented for inspection. Eh, so how customs ever get so much custom then? Tracy, and the customs alone involved in the clearance process, you know, even though them we tend to talk about. Look at it this way, shipment delayed? Talk to your airline agent. Missing items? Talk to your freight forwarder. The charges surprise you now. Call customs. But remember to collect your sign and stamp declaration.
