So you have to know how to handle the phone to ensure you started with the operator, last year I asked him what was the task L, what was his name, Excel. They were asking me where I called him from, I said Jamaica. The man asked me where in Jamaica, I said Hanover, Lucy. The man said where, I said Suriname, I said Jamaica sir. All know the man don't know what I'm talking about. When I asked him about something, the man was answering the phone. The man had the chat spread long, so he don't know where I'm going to chat with Mr Mullins. So the somebody with the answer phone called him, he's not Jamaica.
