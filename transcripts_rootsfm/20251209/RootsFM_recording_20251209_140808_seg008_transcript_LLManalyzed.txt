============================================================

It's day, it's day, I play the role of someone, someone, baby, always in control. But at night, I come home on turkeys There's nobody there's no one cares for me What's the sense? I'm trying hard to find a dream Where there's someone to share it with She ain't no one but for me I want to run to you I want to run, to you Won't you hold me in your arms
