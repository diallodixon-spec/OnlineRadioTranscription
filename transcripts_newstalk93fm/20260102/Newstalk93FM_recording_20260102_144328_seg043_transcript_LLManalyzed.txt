20260102 144328 This is the piece that you cannot buy. Send me love that you cannot mix. One is the joy that you you cannot waste And the other one price that you cannot fix This is the beast that you cannot buy Finding a way where you cannot see Man with this cyst if he cannot breathe I need to find relief But behind my mind it runs All these thoughts have trouble me Find it to give up my bed. Finding to be on my land, my mind. Running to the other side, when it's time to leave my life. Then it tries to take me out, tell you what I need. Right, yeah, I really need, I really need money.
