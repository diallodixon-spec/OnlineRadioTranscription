Who knows? Who knows, who knows, who knows? I just go with the trapping blows Sendin' love to my friends and foes And I suppose I'm pleased to be chillin' in duets with you You're a provider with my concept needs I got the sunshine, rivers and me If I ever make it in your life You are gon' be livin' like royalty So me and me say the thing alright Never ever happy think twice, no way If I ever make it in a lie I don't believe in like royalty So me happy set in a row never ever happy think twice no way Me used to sleep on stagger couch
