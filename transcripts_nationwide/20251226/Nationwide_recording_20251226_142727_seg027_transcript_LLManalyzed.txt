20251226 142727 Oh, yeah Last night I slept alone I stayed at home For this time since you've been gone, babe No friends to understand To lend a helping hand To ease the greatest pain I've ever known How you walked away so easily Still remains a mystery to me Don't you remember that you promised me Yes, you promised me that you'd never leave me, boy But you went away, babe And it's so touching How could you turn your back on me, oh If you really don't want me, if you don't want me You really don't need me If you don't need me, you don't love me Tell me, who do you love?
