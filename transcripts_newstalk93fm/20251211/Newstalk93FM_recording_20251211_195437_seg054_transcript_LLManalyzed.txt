2025-12-12 14:00:25 I just want to leave my signature on everybody part of you girl So don't come and bring no talk and make no drama start Cuz I just taking a walk to be so judgemental Just leave my business and mind your own Don't judge me cuz I have no control of no girl Hold me tight and mind no mess I have no control Of no and I'll let you know, you're raining in my soul.
