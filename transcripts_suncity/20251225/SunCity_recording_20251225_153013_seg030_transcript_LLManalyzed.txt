Hey, happy holidays to you and the family, all right? 876392. Hey, Merry Christmas to you. Hey, love be by yourself, Natasha over there in Bull Bay. 876. 589. Merry Christmas in time. I remember when my heart broke. I remember when I gave up loving you. My heart couldn't take no more of you. I was sad. I'll make her rise up everywhere.
