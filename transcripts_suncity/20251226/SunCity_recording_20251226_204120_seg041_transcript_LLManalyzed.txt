20251226 204120 What up, Daniel? What you mean? Yeah, we taking back what's mine. Let's go. 30 days in repeat. What? Brand new, no peace. I want land, I want peace. I want freedom, not received. I was raised to hustle, but not too old. Told to move out, never shown a home. Working two jobs, still broke in the phone. Whole life gone, and I don't even long. Can't rest, can't build, can't breathe breathe they keep us in debt just to watch us please post the wins hide the grief but I'm done capping I'm out this leash I see the scam I peek the game they rich off labor we live in pain fake American dream it's shame I'm stacking it
