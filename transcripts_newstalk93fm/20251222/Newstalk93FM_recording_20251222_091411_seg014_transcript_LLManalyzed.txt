20251222 091411 Take your troubles and throw them all away. Get ready to run across the stage. Get ready, get ready. Anxiety, my remedy. I tell you that we're all in love. Jump up and show me love. Waited up and showed me love. Together till we're all in it. Love. Jump up show me love, wait up show me love. Suck and make we shun up together. No place to go.
