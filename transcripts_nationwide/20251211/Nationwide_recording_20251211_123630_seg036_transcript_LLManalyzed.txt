The Police Civilian Oversight Authority will be hosting its Transforming Our Police Service TOPS program on Thursday, December 18, 2025. The TOPS program, established in 2019, aims at ensuring that police officers adhere to Jamaica Constabulary Force policies. Additionally, the program looks at boosting their confidence, morale and spirits. The program is comprised of four phases. The TOPS area competition, the TOPS area award ceremony, area command performance and area command re-inspection. All phases that foster professionalism and accountability.
