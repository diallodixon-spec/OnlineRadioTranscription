I'm just sitting there watching fools fool themselves. Thinking they're fooling right through you. And don't let them stop you from your love, your ambition. Jaimando help you rise to the occasion. And do let them stop you, from you of your own vision. Jaimondo help you, cause I'm still giving thanks. Free ride, oh yeah, oh, yeah Big up all nice and decent people Big up every youth when I stop trying
