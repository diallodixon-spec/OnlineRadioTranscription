20260102 200203 Green says the initiative provided about 100 farmers with vouchers valued at $50,000 each for fertilizer, weed whackers, sprays and big way. Over $7 million of support today to our farmers and fishers, giving them everything from direct inputs like seeds and fertilizer, to equipment, to things like fishing wire, binding wire, and also ropes so that our fishers can go back out as quickly as possible, so that our farmers can go back out quickly as possible. All of this is coordinated through our Hurricane Melissa Recovery force, so that we are not duplicating the effort. So it is one sustained effort, some being done by the private sector, some being by the ministry, but ultimately serving as much farmers and officials as possible.
