============================================================

In your life, fall down. No test, no testimony. If you can't bear your cross, you can't wear a crown. If God be for us, we will be victorious. Watch the giants in your life fall down. One by one, two by two, three by three. They have to flee. One by one. Two by two. Three by three. Watch them flee. If God be for us, we will be victorious. Watch the giants in your life, fall down. I never trouble you, you come trouble me You think I was all alone, but I'm in God's army
