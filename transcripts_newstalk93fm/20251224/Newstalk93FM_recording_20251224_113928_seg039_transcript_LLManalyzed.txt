20251224 113928 I'm not coming home tonight. I'm not going home tonight. It's a party the party. So I don't think no such party you like me? Yeah. Hey. Shake your bambam. Kill your middle body, baby, where you come from. Tick it like a punch, add a dash in and bam. Energy, she come in and go drop it like gun. Watch she balance the ting right down. Style, she a bubble through the base and the drum. Everyday she call, say she want me to come. Body lick it, tick it, got the kitty.
