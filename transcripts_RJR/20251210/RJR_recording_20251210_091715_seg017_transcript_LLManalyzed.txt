Where are you trying? Hello? I'm listening, you know. I'm listening. Yeah, man. I'm listening to you. Good, good, good, good. But, you know.

Yes, yes. I'm trying to help the family, and I'm to help as much strangers as possible. And what I ask people, when they see me coming, nowadays they won't call me comrade.
