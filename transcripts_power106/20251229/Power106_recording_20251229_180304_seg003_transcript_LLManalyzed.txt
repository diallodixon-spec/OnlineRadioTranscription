20251229 180304 all 20 wickets in just 79.5 overs across the match, the quickest such collapse in a test since 1928. England's aggressive response at the top, so Zach Crawley and Ben Dockett's match 51 in just 6.5 overs, the highest opening stand of the series. Crawley made 37, Dockett 34, while Jacob Bethel impressed on recall with a composed 40. Final scores in this match, Australia 152 to 132, England 110, and 178 for six. It was only the 27th test in history to finish inside two days, and the performance that brought England much needed belief and momentum at the business end of the ashes. Incidentally, the pitch report has cost the Melbourne Cricket Round a demerit point, five demerit points.
