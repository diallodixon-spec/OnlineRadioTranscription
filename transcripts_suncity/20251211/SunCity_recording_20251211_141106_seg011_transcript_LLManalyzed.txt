Why do flowers come in late? Why does springtime grow old? Why do people fall in love? Oh, they're always thinking of Hawaii. Why do we love in the way of death? Why does the wrong state come with the Tuesday? It's not like I can't explain what's in my heart It's just I feel a crazy pain when we're apart I don't wanna breathe I don't wanna think I don't wanna love I don't wanna do anything
