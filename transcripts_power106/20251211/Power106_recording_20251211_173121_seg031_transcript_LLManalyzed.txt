2025-12-11 18:50:09 Andres, can we say that the best days, the high water mark of the German car industry is behind it now? Yes, for the moment, I fully agree. But hopefully, this crisis will help the German car industry to reinvent themselves. It is a very strong industry. They have very knowledgeable people, brilliant engineers. All they need is a push to go to this crisis and come out much stronger than before. So I'm pretty optimistic. This industry will not go down, but it has to go through a fundamental crisis. But at the end of the day, I hope it will come back much stronger. All right. That's Andreas Herrmann at St. Gallen University in Zurich. Andreas, thank you so much.
