20251218 201610 I walk proud down this street again And they'll all look at me again And they'll see that I'm strong Gonna hear the children laughing Gonna hear Wow. I'm gonna feed again I'm gonna feel the sweet light of heaven shining down It's light on me, one sweet day, one sweet day I will feel it
