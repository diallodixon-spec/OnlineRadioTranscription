20251225 092722 Kissing, kissing the Santa Claus Underneath a man so tall as mine She didn't see me creep Down the stairs to have a creep She thought that I was tucked up in my bedroom master's sheets And I saw mommy take those eggs and rolls Underneath, it's so slow and Oh, what a life it would have been If daddy had only seen Mommy kissing Santa Claus last night
