20260102 094728 is to praise God. Read Isaiah 6, and I saw angels, angels praising him. That's what I am preparing to do, to go to worship, to praise, to adore, to magnify, to exalt, to lift him up and to worship. Somebody praise the Lord God Almighty today, hallelujah. Glory to God Almighty. So there's a place for praise. Let me, oh my gosh, I might have to leave it. My time is gone. Oh, Jesus have mercy on me. All right, so, prayer. Prayer now is talking dialoguing with God whatsoever you call it communing with God dialoguing with God talking to God I'm supplicating God you can turn it anyway the Bible has the dictionary have several different meaning the higher the lower being supplicated the higher being for something but it's prior it's just talking to God that's I'm gonna let's because time is against me let me just leave it there so we need first of all to ask him for direction it's the first of the year it's the first month and we don't know the unknown as yet what's gonna happen this year in January
