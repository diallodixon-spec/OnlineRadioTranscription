20251231 134336 But, and you know the funny thing Simon, there were garbage bins right beside the litter. And you ask yourself, to what extent are these people really thinking that tomorrow they want to come back to the park and play with their family and have all sort of fun. And they're doing the place like this. No wonder Lanky had to close down at one point. I don't know if you remember with the rats. No wonder why some of the beaches are closed and you have a beach but I have to leave it there Lorna. I really appreciate you giving me this opportunity but Jamaicans need in the new year to stop littering. It is atrocious and we need to go back to civic pride. Thank you so much, Sermon. Have a wonderful year. And we can't only be nationalistic when we go stadium, go watch football or we're watching our athletes on the track and then we puff up our chests and say I am a Jamaican and Jamaican is the best.
