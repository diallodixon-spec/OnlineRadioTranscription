20251215 135143 I've been contemplating What all of this means It's not that I'm complaining But circumstances be real And I know you'll see these changes Yeah, round and round we go Doesn't it just feel amazing When I got you up in my zone You're like my favorite painting One i would never sell just have you up in my room to feel you when you're there closer. And me just can't reveal me emotions. And girl me want to see you and do the most to you. I said me why you feel the same, so. I want you to feel the same. Girl, I want you feel the same. I want you feeling the same.
