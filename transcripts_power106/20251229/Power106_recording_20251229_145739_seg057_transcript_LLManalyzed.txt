20251229 145739 If you're on your deathbed and really sick and only have one witness, can that be an exception and make the will valid? Excellent question, but unfortunately the answer is no. The law, and you can check it, you can search it online, it's the Wills Act, it is very clear. For a will to be valid, it must have two witnesses. So no matter how ill the person is, no matter how close they are to their demise, if the will doesn't have two witnesses, it is not going to be valid. And I know of situations where someone is in the hospital and the only persons who can witness their wills are the hospital staff.
