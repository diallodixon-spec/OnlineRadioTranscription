20251229 182922 tournament in Grenada. Fundraising can be challenging, but we're in the process of trying to flesh out how, when, why, where, how we are going to market ourselves. And, you know, there are lots, there's some things in the pipeline, there are some things that we had in the pipeline that didn't go as planned, but that is always a challenge. But I, I don't think we should try to let it defeat us if, I mean, nothing beats, um, not getting the funding rather than not trying, you know, except not trying. And so we are going to be trying to seek funding. Currently we have like for the gene peer tournament, we have our raffle tickets out for sale, and we're hoping that parents and family members and, you know, club members will support this initiative so that we can get to do, you know, the things that we need to do to move up in ranking. I am sure it's going to happen. Mrs. Faith Crooks, you need parents.
