20260101 105331 Since I have no wings, I cannot fly, fly, fly. Since I have the wings, since I have no wings. Since I have wings, I have to sing, sing, sing. If I had wings like a dove, if I had no wings like a dove. I would fly, fly away, fly away and be at rest. It's Jerry what brings all my gear. Bring me three. It's Jerry what bring all my gear, bring me three.
