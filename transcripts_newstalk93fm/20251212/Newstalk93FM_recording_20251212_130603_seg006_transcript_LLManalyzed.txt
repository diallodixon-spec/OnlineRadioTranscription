20251212 130603 So don't be late The truck can't wait We are here to celebrate I'm telling you Hard work without the smart work It's not work We don't want no batter that I need A little breather Two days on the road With some jam in the middle Dive in wrong we need to find The middle For the sake of peace of mind So the metal of the world is bare You'll find me and my friend and them because We move so hard, so hard For a week, we deserve a party We deserve it, we deserve it Say we deserve it, say we deserve it Tell all your friends and them Tell all all the girls and them, bring all your friend and them And let's get it started I say, I say, boy oh boy oh boy Oh, so come and say fake a joke But let we start it by the joke, by the joke Let we start it, by the joke Party on the road, there's a party on the road
