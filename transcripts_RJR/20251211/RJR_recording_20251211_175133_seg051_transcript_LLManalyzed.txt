2025-12-11 19:11:52 Thank you so much for staying with us. We continue with you on Beyond the Headlines. I'm Dionne Jax-Millow, Justice Minister Naroy Chuk with us now. Minister, thanks so much for talking to us. How you do? Hi, good evening Dionne and good evening to your listeners. Appreciate it as always. How you found the debate overall? Well, the problem is that we laid the bill on the 10th of October and I thought we would have completed by the end of October and then Melissa you know intervened so not many I had expected that more persons would have participated but we only had participation from only about four persons okay everything went well okay because I remember when we spoke initially you were saying this is something that every MP has to deal with. They come to me all the time. So I expected them to support the bill or to also indicate areas of improvement that can be made from here on. Okay. MP
