The initiative, led by the Jamaica Public Service in partnership with the Jamaica Social Investment Fund, was officially closed out on Thursday during a community event at the Riverton Meadows Baptist Church. JPS says electricity theft had been widespread in the area, contributing to unsafe wiring, frequent outages, and heavy financial losses for the company. The project, valued at more than $150 million, focused on installing proper infrastructure, approved house wiring, and customer metering, while moving residents onto legitimate service. JPS officials say the program included house-to-house assessments, electrical inspections, and community mapping, with educational campaigns focused on electricity safety, energy conservation, and building a payment culture.
