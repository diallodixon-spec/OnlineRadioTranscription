20251230 203016 I don't want to waste my days I want to spend them on enjoyment. Baby, grab a hand, make you know they shall like it. I don't want nobody to keep my man taken like that. For this life I live, I want to be celebrated. Don't want to waste my days. I'm dying to see you go. All the while I've been around, every day bad to you.
