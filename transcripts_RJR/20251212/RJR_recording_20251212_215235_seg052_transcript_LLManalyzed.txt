20251212 215235 I feel free when I do my meditation. All I want is just a piece of mind. Now I understand, sometimes them free my mind. So welcome to the new me redefined. Now watch me climb. Them can't take my blessing now, my blessing now. Even when they think they strong. Them know they know where they from. Can't harm me. I got to give my blessing now. My blessing now. Them can take my blessing now. Let them know that no weapon can harm me. I go through all the things I like Don't tell me I have to live my life Nobody tell me how to live my life You go on, go live your life Cause I go through other things I like My life is blessed by the most high Me no need no co-sign Every day we see the dollar sign Still in the meeting with the sultans Role presentation, everything by Jodi
