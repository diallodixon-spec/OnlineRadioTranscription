20251226 131409 Yes, we jammin' down to the end See me with me cannibal friend Lord, me cannibal friend I wish you come from there London, I wish you'd come from there New York, I wish I'd come from there When you come in, my baby I wish I'd came from there Atlanta, she come from there Toronto, she'd come from there And I know that you miss me I love the way that you bring a vibe With your hands them up in the sky Fallin' down and havin' a time Wine in season again And we have the money to spend And we jammin' down to the end Rollin' with me cannibal friend And feel the beat up again. Everything on sound.
