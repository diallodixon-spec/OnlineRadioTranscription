20251223 174953 This is my decision, decision This is my decision I don't think you'll listen, you'll listen I don't you'll listen For me to come out, it must mean I'm out the door It It must mean, I'm not the same. It must mean I'm on your case. For me to go out, it means that I'm not a dog. I want to show you my world. Give me one break, I need faith. Faith to believe you. Faith to receive you. Give me something I'm lacking. I don't need nothing, you are my everything Only me and you, only me and you
