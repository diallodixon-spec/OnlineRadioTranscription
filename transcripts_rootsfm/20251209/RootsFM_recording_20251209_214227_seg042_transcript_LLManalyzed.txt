This is our fourth love's last episode. There's nowhere to go. Oh, no. your choice Now it's up to me To bow our gracefully Though you hold the key But baby Whenever you call me I'll be there Whenever you call me I'll be there. Whenever you want me, I'll be there whenever you need me. I'll be there, I'll be around.
