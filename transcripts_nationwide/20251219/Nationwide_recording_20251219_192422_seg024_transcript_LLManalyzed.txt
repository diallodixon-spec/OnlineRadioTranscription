So as it is North or New Port West, we have different teams coming in, coming from the National Police College of Jamaica, and they really have meant what does that mean. And we have instructors and sergeants, and we have full teams coming in. So right through the day, right up to 10, 12 midnight, we have teams in the space. As long as the war remains active, we have teams out there. And a part of their briefing that was given to them is that they will continue to just maintain their alertness in terms of what is happening and to continue to just identify persons. So if there's somebody and something is going off, you know, they might not be doing something in terms of safety, then we just remind them.. So, for example, first they come in the space, they have a call of money, and they just want $10,000 to pay at one of the brokers. They'll be pulling out that entire car with $200,000. So, the officer pulls in $1,000, and that's where you don't need to be doing anything else in the public space.
