============================================================

Only you could see how I've been. If I'm being real, no, it ain't been the same. We could talk if we want. I already know it's no good for me. It's all right. I think I'm fine with the silence. There's some good and goodbyes. Oh, I'm back on your sofa. Of course, I still care. And love's never wasted when it's shared. And although it's over, I'll always be there Only have a couple minutes and we're going back to real life In your heart, every part of me will let go Let it start to be in your heart
