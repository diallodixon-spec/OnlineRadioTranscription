He has sent me to proclaim freedom to the prisoners and recovery of sight to the blind, to release the oppressed, to proclaim the year of the Lord's faith. O God, the mission is yet to be brought to completion. Many today are oppressed by their own selves or by others. Many are imprisoned in their own minds. Many are wounded and need to be healed. So we turn to you, O Heavenly Father, the healer. Reconcile all estranged relationships. Heal physical and psychological wounds so that your people may be in best of health, in body, mind and spirit. Set your people free
