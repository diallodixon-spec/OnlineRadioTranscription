So for my listeners who maybe have seen pictures post Melissa, tell us how things stay now. How far have the town, people in the town managed to clean up and tidy up and get on with things? Describe for us where we are. Okay, so things have improved significantly. As you can see, the main road to the hospital is now accessible. That was not the case days after the hurricane, and things are looking much better. It was very depressing just traversing this area days after the hurricane. So the cleaning up exercise has been good, not as depressing as before.
