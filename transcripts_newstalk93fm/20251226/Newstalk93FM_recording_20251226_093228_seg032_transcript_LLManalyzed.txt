20251226 093228 I just want you to come and ride it up Just a little winding out Come and meet me at the end of the truck and we rev it up Say pull it Keep throwing it back at the way you stopped us Baby, no way We could boast of all the pictures you want When you're ready I could overshare, darling You could overshare But we could meet in the middle and start a bacchanal Play in the middle, hey What we gonna do now? Jam to a rhythm. Heat a carnival. What we go do now? Start a wine on it. I say compromise on it. Baby, spend time on it. I said compromise on it. We start to own it. I say compromise, on it. Me, me, me. Spend time on it. I say, compromise on it. Oh, oh, oh, oh.
