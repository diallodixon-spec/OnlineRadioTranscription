============================================================

So pray for me If I don't come home in the morning Just know that I say it's not in my place But this mass have a hold on me I can't leave Until every single bottle done If anyone looking for me then You can find me wherever on the road, I'm ready to walk that it's ok to have me, I won't see me Wednesday To send a search-party to find me I lost on the road already Tell them that is ok to have me I won't see my Wednesday
