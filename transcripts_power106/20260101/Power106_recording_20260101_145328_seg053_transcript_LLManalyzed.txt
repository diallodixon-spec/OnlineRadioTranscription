20260101 145328 We're on an island All alone, just you and me Where no one will ever find us There's no place I'd rather be than stay Preservations for two This is just between me and blue There will be no sending in line Cause baby, tonight you're mine, mine I don't wanna lose you, you're the one I'm living for Oh I need you here before me baby, can't be without you
