20251230 203621 We've played so much without you, but now I'm back and you say Just a little bit longer, baby But my love keeps growing stronger A little more time to save, but in my head I love someplace For you and me We're playing the rain together A feeling lives on forever Memories that bring tears of joy We've had our share of bad times too Hurting each other, me and you Brought us much closer in the end. There's just two months with both of us to put it all down the drain. I've stayed awake just for a while, but now you're driving me insane. Just a little bit longer.
