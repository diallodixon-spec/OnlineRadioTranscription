And I believe somehow, we're in a perfect play Finally She wants to come and stay Can't wait another day And now I don't feel so far away 41 days, 42 nights, 43 nights, 44 tries I must say, it felt a kind of way But it was only you in my eyes I felt pain when you refrained First time I asked you your name Now you're in my domain And you're staying And you got me saying I'm Ali She loves, she loves me now And I believe somehow we're in the perfect place. Finally, she wants to come and stay. Can't wait another day. And now I don't see a piece of our world.
