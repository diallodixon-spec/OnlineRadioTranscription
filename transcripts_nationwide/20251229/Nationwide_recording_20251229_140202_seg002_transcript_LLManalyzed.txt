20251229 140202 My name is Turbulence and Rastafari way me choose it Occupation is singing and making music My hobbies are reading and playing football But most of all I like to hold And give you sweet love when nature calls Faster than ever boy I'll be standing tall Let's procreate baby do not stall For your figure is enough man of all That's why I need your name and number And where you reside I need you by my side Hey, hey, hey, Mr. Supervisor
