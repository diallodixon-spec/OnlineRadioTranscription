20251212 142320 Are you gonna look at our managing director? Give me an answer. Is he correct? He is indeed correct, and you are the winner of a brand new Bluetooth speaker. I want to remind you, it's water resistant, not waterproof. That mean you're not going to be in it now. But that mean if something spills on it, you can just wipe it off. All right, so we're gonna enjoy that. You're gonna stand right here. And DJ String, may you play some music really low while Spectrum Management Authority's managing director, Maria, you see we're on first name basis now, Maria, gives our Bluetooth speaker to our youngster right here. Congratulations and Merry Christmas when it comes. Alright DJ String I feel like I want you to continue playing a little low and we're gonna continue giving away our prizes because we're coming to the close
