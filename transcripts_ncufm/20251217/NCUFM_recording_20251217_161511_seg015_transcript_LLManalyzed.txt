20251217 161511 A wellness bite from NCU FM. Smoking increases the risk of cancer. That was a called. I have some really tough finals coming up, and I could sure use some extra wisdom. Also, I'm still trying to find an inexpensive car. Do you think you could arrange something? Are your prayers just shopping lists for God to fill out? Is that God on the line? Yeah. Tell him we need a miracle for the rent money this month. Oh, okay. Uh, God, our funds are low and any help you could provide- Did you mention the car? Yeah, I told him. Anything else? Yeah, my date this Saturday night. I'd like it to turn out nice. And Bob is going out. Uh, don't let Bob make a fool out of himself again.
