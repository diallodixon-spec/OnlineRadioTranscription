20251222 170608 I'm not coming home tonight. I'm not going home tonight. Don't send us a party to find me. I out on the road, I lie me. Tell them that it's over, I have me. Hey, hey, I won't see me Wednesday. Don't send a search party to find me, I lost on the road. I write me, tell them that it's all over. I have me, hey, hey, I will see me Wednesday, hey, hey. Island. Right now it is a wasteland, wasteland of love. Wasteland, wasteland. Wasteland.
