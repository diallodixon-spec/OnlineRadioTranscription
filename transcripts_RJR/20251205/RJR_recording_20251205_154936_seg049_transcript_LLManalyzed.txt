Part of the problem that we have at Radio Jamaica 94 is when we have people from the next show of them come here to our show and want to do things. When I know Shevani is not waking up and passing by in the morning time. I've been seeing him lingering around here and I wonder where Shevani. Shevon is supposed to be coming in the morning. So Shevon, you sleep? Because were you on this morning? Oh, you. No, but Shevon, come and dig up this or something. I know when me and Johnny must do it. What is that? I'm going to read it, Johnny.
