20251224 090406 Wednesday, December 24. It's Christmas Eve. I'm Raulston Hyman. With me is Dr. Andreas Sutherland. We're coming to you live from the studios of Paul No. 6 FM, which are now located on the first floor of the RGR building, our third tool in the store in Kingston, Jamaica. And we now begin with the breaking news. Central Bank Governor Richard Biles is now on the road to Damascus. Here's why. He's now lamenting the government's inability to fully spend the anemic capital budget over the years, slowing down growth and making the country more vulnerable to natural disasters such as Hurricane Melissa. He is also questioning the government's ability to do so in order to facilitate the recovery from Hurricane Melissa. He also says he will be intervening in foreign exchange markets four times in January of next year and further further the country's trade and current account deficits will deteriorate in the near term. He overstressed that the monies flowing from the CAT bond, the CRIF, and the multilateral agencies in conjunction with the $6.15 billion in NIR will be used to maintain stability.
