20251212 201309 If it rains from the skies Or tears from my eyes That's falling on my face And rolling down my cheek All I know is that I love. And you will always be, John. Yeah, from fainting me still. Oh, bring on, bring back your loving to me, cause it's rolling down. Can't you see it baby? Rolling down, crying on my knees, I'm rolling down. Can't you see it sweating out my brain?
