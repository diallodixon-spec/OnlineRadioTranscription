It looks just like any other school. Scores of children dressed in their school uniform are running around an open yard next to the main school block, which is a one-story building made up of classrooms and some dormitories. The school has 210 students, aged from 6 to 19 years, learning the same subjects as in other schools, including reading, writing, maths and science. But the teaching here is very different, focusing on how the children learn, using visual resources and practical lessons. Teacher Dorothy invited me into her class. Here you have to teach differently. Even the teaching strategies and methods, they are very different from other schools because in other schools they use the teacher-centered, but here we use the learner-centered method to teach. So what do you do in classes here that is different to other schools? We use the unsung materials.
