20251212 131105 You left and never say goodbye Those tears I cried, no, I can't get over it So don't you ever let me down again Cause I'm depending on you, so you better come through this time Please hear my cry and if I ever let you down my friend it was a misunderstanding so if I took it for granted then I promise from today I'll go jump like I never jump waved like I never waved whined like I never wanted to just to show you a I'm sorry And I need you back in my life Look at people buying a truck Emotions running high We are not in the sky Days running down we high Can't you tell that we sorry? We sorry And we need you back in we high
