20251218 131408 I can see it in your eyes, too. I wanna be gone. And I know I'm gonna miss you, my love. I was up where they were. Cause I've been down, been down too long. And you, you keep doing me wrong. And I'll be gone. I'm tears to you. And all of it all while I cry. All of it all while tears to you. Keep my eyes up and've been drawn to you.
