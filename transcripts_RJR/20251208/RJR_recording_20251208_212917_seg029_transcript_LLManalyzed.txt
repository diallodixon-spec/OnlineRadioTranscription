============================================================

If we can go, we must believe it. In our hearts we'll believe it. Love is where you find it. What's this mystery I've been captured in? I can feel the glow of love touching on my skin. When I'm close to you, there's a special light within. It only happens when I'm right here with you. Oh, with the strangers anticipating one another. I'm so blessed with what we've discovered. Love is where you find it. With your heart inside it. There is no rhyme or reason. It just comes and makes you weak and weak.
