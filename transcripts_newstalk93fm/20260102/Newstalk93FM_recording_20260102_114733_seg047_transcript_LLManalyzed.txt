Look at Bumper, are you ready to jam? Are you looking for a gal? You do what you want. So when you're ready, you can jam and follow your heart and never find out why no one like it. I've been tempted to wind on everybody inside, yeah. Like yourself, like yourself, like yourself So you can jump up and do your own time and go find out who I like And it's your filter, whine on everybody inside, yeah Like yourself Like yourself Like yourself Until the party's done Why don't you try to run the line? And you don't try to stop me vibe so don't say You do what you want, I do what I like You will not forget no shame Cause when it comes to party I is not the man And I know when we come to party we don't have a plan
