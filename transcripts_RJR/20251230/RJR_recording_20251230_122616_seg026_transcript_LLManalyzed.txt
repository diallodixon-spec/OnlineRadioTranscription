20251230 122616 Voice of the Nation is Radio Jamaica. You're now listening to Clive Mullings Talk With Substance on Hotline. Radio Jamaica, active for the good of our nation. Welcome back. I really am shocked to hear that the passing of Donald Oliver passed away suddenly this morning. Donald Oliver was an analyst and broadcast extraordinary. You could hear his voice at the stadium and even overseas meets. And I can't imagine the sense of loss and shock only for the community.
