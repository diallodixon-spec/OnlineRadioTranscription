20251217 113628 JLP was nervous on election night and we are grateful that the government actually come through to continue the work that they are doing. In terms of the party though, Cliff, I know that they would have not got the time to do a proper post-mortem based on everything that is happening that has happened since the election and Melissa add to that. Cliff I think that they need to do a proper post-mortem and I mean things like what Munchy B said earlier and a lot of us have some other thoughts of some of the mistake that was made or in the previous term Cliff that the party should listen to and try to correct going forward and stuff and I think they should create a forum, the party should create a forum to bring us all together and canvass these views so they can be better prepared the next time around.
