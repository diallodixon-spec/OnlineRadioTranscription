Oh, juiciness. Squeeze with me. Juiciness. Bumper looking like a apple. Biting to the fruitiness. Everything fresh. Look at the shell. When you come late, everything done sell. If you're looking for sweetness to put inside a basket I am the holy, holy, holy blinking market And if you're go nuff, it's a jelly inside, inside, and if you open your eyes, them wide, them wide, you'll see everything that you like, that you like, my ting's forever in season, forever in season, when are you ready for this squeezing? Hey, hey, hey, won't you see me?
