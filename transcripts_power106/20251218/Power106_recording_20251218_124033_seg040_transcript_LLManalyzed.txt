20251218 124033 engineering upgrades, because as with all aspects of post-Melissa life in Jamaica, we're going to have to do things for the long term. Now what longer term engineering upgrades are being explored by you and the team to improve the resilience of irrigation infrastructure here in Jamaica? Okay, there are two things that I would want to highlight. One, we have learned some lessons from Hurricane Beryl. Some of our stations where we produce power, the solar PV systems, we had significant loss there. And we, in rebuilding those, would have built in some resilience so that the similar impact would not have the same outcome. And we have also procured generators. We are also now in the process of procuring additional generators so that if another one should come next year or whenever in the future we would be prepared. Before the hurricane we would have determined where
