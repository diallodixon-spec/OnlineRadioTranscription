Party starts when you're going out nice enough. One call away. Drinks in the air, yeah, is that nice enough? One call away. I don't want to hear any shots, no, no, no. One call away, just let me be all right. Let me fix you on call and I'll be there. I'll be there right away. No long talk. I am my way. Let me fix you on talk. Tell me what you want. I could give it to you right now, baby. Baby, running out the concert could build you up right now. Baby, I know what you're feeling. I see what you're working with.
