20251217 141108 And never ever put your stallion pano shelf In a survival of lot of black belt The system upheld all the pain you felt When sunshine meets sun, hey nothing can't melt Corrum them with precision and stealth Light shows you light Make lemonade They fight you all the time Don't be afraid. Just work hard. And work smarter. It will be okay. You are safe. Never let your own self get in your way. Opportunity nuts that fly the door right away. Never give in to your own insecurities. Tell them confidence is sorrity. You control your mind and your mind controls your body.
