So, I did a fellowship there along with my friend who's also a member of the band because she's right there in Trinidad right now doing pre panorama things and we'll be seeing each other tomorrow for a trip in the Maldives to perform the steel pan as well. So, what can I say? But what was that like though? Because that's like coming to Jamaica to do reggae. So to go to Trinidad where, you know, steel pan is, oh my gosh, it's a genesis of steel pan. What was that like or what difference was that like for you? Well, I could see the similarities in terms of like a sound system culture. The steel fan was so massive, you could feel the vibration. Just the whole cultural awareness of everybody looking forward to the Panorama movement, the bunch of events, there's live music all around.
