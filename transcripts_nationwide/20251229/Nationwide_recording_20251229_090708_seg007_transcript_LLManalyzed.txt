So, of course, maybe everyone already know that some of our Caribbean friends, relatives, have been added to that travel ban. We're talking about Dominica has now been added and Tiguan Barbuda has also been added. And so what that means, if you're in one of those countries or family members or friends in those countries, they're not going to be issuing any visiting visas. I guess maybe limited circumstance. So there's certainly out everything, there's always some exception, right?
