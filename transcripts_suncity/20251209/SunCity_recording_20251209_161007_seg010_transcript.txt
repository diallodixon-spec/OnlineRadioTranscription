I see something about pre-sale lunch and entry packages versus the entry alone. Is that something? Talk to me about that. Yes. So the lunch and entry package pre-sale is 20052,500. We will have the food available tomorrow, which is tomorrow, Wednesday. Yes. Yes. And then for the Friday now, where we have the after party now, starting at four, going up to 12, you have your pre-sale tickets for $2,000. And at the gate, it's just $3,000. So if you have to get your ticket before Friday, you can definitely come and enter at the gate by paying your $3,000 So just a clarity, if I buy the pre-sale lunch and entry package, right? I get the lunch tomorrow and then I just come and then the admission on Friday.
