20251218 211510 I promise to give it to you just the way you like. And who can love you like me? Who can love me like me? Nobody. Who can lay your body down? Nobody, baby. And who can treat you like me? Who can give you what you need? And who can do you all night long? Nobody, baby, on and on, on. I'm on on, on on and on, I'm on on on and on. Nobody, baby. Come on. I want, I want and I want.
