I have a dream that someday We'll all walk hand in hand I have a dream That someday This is going to be a better land Maybe you can't see my me You can't see my dream But I'm sure someday you'll understand And dream, dream, dream Oh, how sweet the words Love and peace sound to our ego Won't know one thing wrong, my friends
