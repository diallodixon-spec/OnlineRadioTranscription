20251218 160104 Tracy? Hey, girl, what's up? So hold on. Why you look so vexed this early? The energy just stopped. Lisa, it is so good to see you. But sorry you catch me like this, girl. My uncle said when my family go for clarity, you don't want to hear the price of the people they put on or something. But matters are worse, me hear say half of the thing they missing, and me know say a customs. Girl, how you know say a customs? At least I stop going like I have no sense, man. You know say everybody I talk about it in the media. You know enough to stop listen to hear say. You ever experience that? Custom don't go into your package, suitcase, barrel or cargo unless you ship the item or the agent stand up right there when they inspect it. Listen. Customs' job is to protect the borders, collect revenue and facilitate trade.
