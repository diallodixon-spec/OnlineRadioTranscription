to become a light for others during this Christmas season through small acts of service. One of the things that we encourage persons to do is to not reinvent the wheel this Christmas. We live in a culture of cherished Christmas traditions. We invite persons this Christmas to add light to those traditions. For those of us who love to bake our nice Christmas cake, think of somebody who you can bake a cake for and give it to have Christmas parties or dance. That is not me, by the way, but for those of us who love to do that, let's not forget those persons in our neighborhood who are lonely, who don't have anyone visiting them. Let's remember them.
