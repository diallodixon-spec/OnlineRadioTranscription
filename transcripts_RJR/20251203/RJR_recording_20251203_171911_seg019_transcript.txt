At about 9 a.m., three armed men invaded the home of a Chinese businesswoman on Haining Road in New Kingston. The men used their weapons to assault the woman while demanding money. A security team from Hawkeye Security Company was alerted, and on their arrival, they were greeted with gunfire. During the exchange of gunfire, one of the guards was shot. Two of the gunmen made their escape on foot, while the third drove away the businesswoman's 2018 Toyota Hyas. The suspect, however, lost control of the vehicle, which crashed into a utility pole along Oxford Road in the vicinity of Norwood Avenue. The police have launched a search for the suspects. The St. Catharines South Police say the owner of a property where 29 Haitians were found in Edgewater Portmore on Monday has been warned and is to be interviewed again. The police say activities at the Andrea Crescent premises were previously being monitored, but more recently with the increased housing of Haitians. It drew greater attention and was deemed a caution.
