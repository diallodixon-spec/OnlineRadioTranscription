I wonder what it was like in St. Elizabeth, Black River, where they had one last night as well. St. Ann had as well, Montego Bay, Negril. Yes, listen, guys, 2026. We know 2025 was tough, but we make it, you know. We're here. I was home. I didn't have to set my alarm for when 12 o'clock was going to be, because at 12 o'clock, me and pop, pop, pop. No, no, no, no. But I did decide that at midnight, I was going to just do some quiet time and prayer of gratitude for 2025 and what it represented and just what some of my dreams and aspirations are for myself and people around me for 2026. It's a reflective time, isn't it? A lot of people, this is a time when they take to reflect on what was and project, I guess, what they're looking for for 2026 and beyond. It's good to project.
