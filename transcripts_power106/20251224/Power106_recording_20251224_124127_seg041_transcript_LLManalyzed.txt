20251224 124127 Do you mean as to how they were built in the first place? Yes. This government from 2016 has not built one school, one new school. No school has been built in the country. Every year the budget increases education ministry. I am urging the government, get structural engineers, send them into the schools, see if they have damage and repair or spend the money because I would rather you spend the money in high school than one child is injured because of some damage. I don't know what it was. I'm detecting. I just go into 2026. Here we place more emphasis on our children.
