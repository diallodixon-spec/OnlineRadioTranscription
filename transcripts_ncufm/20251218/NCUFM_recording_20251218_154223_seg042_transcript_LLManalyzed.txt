20251218 154223 And I only need to ask and you erase all of my past forever My debts have all been paid and they have all been washed away Into the sea of forgetfulness you placed all of my sins For I'm the one who keeps reminding you over and over again into the sea of forgetfulness as far as it's from the West 70 times 7 you've forgiven me And you keep cleansing me And placing my sin into the sea of forgetfulness It's your unfailing love
