**Inspiring Story of Overcoming Adversity: Dr. Lincoln Ferguson Shares His Journey**

In a heartwarming and inspiring interview on Radio Jamaica's "Beyond the Headlines" with host Dionne Jackson-Miller, Dr. Lincoln Ferguson shared his remarkable story of overcoming adversity and achieving success. Dr. Ferguson's journey is a testament to the power of perseverance, determination, and the impact of mentorship.

Growing up in a challenging financial situation, Dr. Ferguson recalled the struggles he faced in his early years, including having to wear ill-fitting clothes to school and facing ridicule from his peers. However, his life took a dramatic turn when his guidance counselor, Mrs. Higgins, introduced him to a dentist, Dr. Fenton Ferguson, who would become his mentor and change the course of his life.

Dr. Ferguson shared how Dr. Fenton Ferguson's support and guidance helped him to focus on his studies and eventually pursue a career in medicine. He remembered the significant difference it made to have a mentor who believed in him and provided him with the necessary resources to succeed. "It made a huge difference," Dr. Ferguson said. "I could relax more, I could learn more, I never had to be thinking how hungry I am, or how am I going to get home this evening because I don't have a bus fare to go back home."

Dr. Ferguson's story is a shining example of how one person can make a significant impact on someone's life. His journey serves as a reminder that with the right support and guidance, anyone can overcome adversity and achieve their goals. As Dr. Ferguson so eloquently put it, "I think when the principal, Mr. Patterson, picked me up, when he bought the books, I think all the books were important turning points, which if they were not, if that didn't happen, I couldn't get to this point."

The interview with Dr. Lincoln Ferguson is a must-listen for anyone looking for inspiration and motivation. His story is a powerful reminder that success is within reach, regardless of one's background or circumstances, and that the right support and guidance can make all the difference.
