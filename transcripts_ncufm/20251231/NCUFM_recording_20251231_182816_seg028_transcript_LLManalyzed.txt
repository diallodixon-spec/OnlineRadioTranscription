20251231 182816 Let's trust in God. Family. My drive time family. We return for another edition of the show tomorrow at 2 o'clock. I want you here with me. I want you with me. So catch me then. Overnight I'll be reserving your seat. No one else can sit in your seat. But that means, if you're absent from the show tomorrow, your seat is going to be empty, your absence is going to be felt, the family feel, the drive time family will be missing you. So come catch back your seat tomorrow. On behalf of my producer, Abigail Williams, and the new Sports and Current Affairs Department and the rest of the team, I'm your driver, M-I-C-A-L, signing out for now, saying keep safe until we meet again for another edition of The Drive. Enough love, my family and friends. Keep safe, until we meet again.
