20251216 103623 I cried out, can anybody hear me? Can anybody see me? No reply. I was almost defeated. I should have been defeated. But my story was far as glory. God changed my name name his power brought me honor in a place where I had shame Jesus to end broke down my barrier Jesus to end all my woes Now I can see, now I can feel, feel my world changing, God lives in me.
