20260101 164226 Waking to wake up, just as a link Life a go change in the eye of a blink No make them trick your son with the fine print Not another day again, everyone extinct Because your men are in them, nothing can Oof, they rise up and sing, them a sing to me Make up me mind, no sir Make your man a turn to thief and a robber Wife too good a clean life to rather Sat on myself, get me head together in a life, no sir You hear me?

Push, push, all when things slow Tough things and pretty but that's who they don't know Man a rough it out from when the clear not go Tough it in a sunshine and in a snow some why Probably good like no new blue Ghosts runnin' in the mouth from the big grow Touch out and roll down on the trunk and door Hey, what's it do? What's it do?
