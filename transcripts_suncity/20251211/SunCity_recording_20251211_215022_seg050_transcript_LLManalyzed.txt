2025-12-12 15:38:35 feel me and all the time you were telling me lies so tonight I'm gonna find a way to make it without you tonight I'm gonna make it without you I'm gonna hold on to the times that we had tonight Nobody ever shut it down like you Why don't you hold me, need me? I thought you told me you'd never leave me. Looking in the sky, I could see your face. And I knew right where I'd been. Take me, make me, you know that I'm yours.
