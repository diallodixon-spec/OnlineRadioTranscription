20251219 184933 Now here is what I find interesting about this league. Chelsea is in fourth on 28 points. Now you listen to this, let me just scroll down here and go all the way down to Brentford in 15th position on 20 points. So we could have seen the league fucking each other depending on what results we see over the weekend. So it's going to be very, very interesting. This is absolutely tight in the middle. And well, in the relegation zone, that's pretty much decided with rules definitely going down. Burnley's down there with a chance of recovery and coming back. And West Ham, of course, there as well. 13 points to be 18th, Burnley 19th with 10. Then we have Leeds in 17th on 16 points. Forrest, can you imagine? Forrest had 18 points. And they lose a couple of games in many times.
