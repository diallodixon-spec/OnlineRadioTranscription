20260102 190708 I want you to just dance off the top. Dance and sell off. Flick us and laugh. Charge you and sell off. People really see it and have to laugh. Oh, Lord. Promoter and his item have to laugh. How them laugh? Cha-la-la-la, la-la-la. Cha-la la-la, la la la la la. Can't find no park, all the dance really cough. Gate man a laugh, and the cashier a laugh. Can't find a buckle with a cough. I said me can't find no space to walk. I need a food before the food itself. Cha-la-la-la, la-la-la. King Kabaka, lyrical champion. Bon Chubba, maker from the champion. Bomb squad crew, step up in the session. From the sunshine up, me have to get admission. One condition, me have to have ambition. To get bigger than Catholic and Anglican.
