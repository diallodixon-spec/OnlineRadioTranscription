20260101 172316 Touch me And I fell apart Ain't nothing Like the lock is locked I'm melting, I'm melting My heart volcano Sensation But nowhere we are So let me Take us through the hours I won't't be scared. Cause this is love. Keep on with the push. Don't stop till you get it. Now keep on with the push, don't stop.
