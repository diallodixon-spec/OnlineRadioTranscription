20251225 213023 You're listening to Sleek Radio, 93 FM. I have a lightning spirit Early in the morning I hit it Me cooler ready, me ice done ready Me punching that's automatic I have a lightning jumbie A kind of energy inside me And it ready for the rum Ready, ready for the rum, ready, ready, for the rum Ready for the action A spiritual encounter Clean me soul taking over Telling me to start up the drinking And do away with good behaviour So we out on the road now It's Mars and Riddy Man Soaker And I'm ready for the rum Ready, ready for the rum
