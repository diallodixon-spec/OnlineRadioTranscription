20251215 114128 I respectfully ask that you urgently look into this matter, not only for my stepson, but for the many patients and families facing similar circumstances. Thank you for your time and attention. I remember the person who calls about, in terms of the sicklers and not getting beds and so on, and this, those things are her, this letter indicating that the person's relative exception had a heart attack and is still sitting up. You're a thing, you know. So we can pass it on to the minister. So it has to come to that, but still. Good day, someone. Quick question. If a person commits a crime as a minor, but is not apprehended until the person becomes an adult, will the person be charged as a minor or as an adult coming from DSA in Canada?
