20251226 165828 I also want to say thank you to my producer Abigail Williams. Wonderful show done today. Wonderful show. Wonderful, wonderful show. I even love how we can take on some Terry Sherry subjects for homework. He's always doing the good shows. Now, as it relates to the Sabbath that is coming in, I'm inviting you to church. Come to church, man. If you can't go't go to physical church you know you can always tune in right here on NCU 91 FM for J.A. Adventists online inside of Daybreak Delight and that's on the Sabbath morning going into the afternoon and even if you even if you worship on a Sunday and man Sunday, go to the church and take in the good Jesus. So coming up next we have the Adventist Church News and the Church Bulletin Board.
