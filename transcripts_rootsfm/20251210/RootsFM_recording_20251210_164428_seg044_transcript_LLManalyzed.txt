Are you still in love with me? Like the way you used to be? Or did it all fade away? And the hurt I feel isn is here to stay in my heart I won't extend what my mind knows to be true that I'm slowly losing you I only try to bring love back your line But something in your eyes says a run is not a time I would call you on the phone just to hear you say
