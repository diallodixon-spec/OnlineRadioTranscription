20251231 162418 I think I left my sweater back in your house Nothing I just want to keep you home Could we pull up something we can barely pronounce? It was difficult to say I love you out loud Been a minute since I went and took the lover But you visit and make it rain Let the flowers bloom, ease my pain Always tell the truth, give me some light What is it you see, what is it you see? Tell me why do you believe in you? Do you keep your schedule free for me? Let me hear you please
