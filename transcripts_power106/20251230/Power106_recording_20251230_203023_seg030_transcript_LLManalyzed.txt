20251230 203023 It's fun. And Twyla. And we're here with what you need to know this week Wink. What the what? So Twyla, I noticed that your hands are empty. When I like how you started the show look so far, when I like that. What do you mean? What am I supposed to have? My specially packaged plate of Christmas dinner leftovers prepared with love by your family. Ha! Listen, if you didn't get that the order did swell special cause nothing ever left for even me much less you. Yeah, so not even one of the piment of the mouth of the gungo rice and peas not even one? Ah, okay, alright. Well, I guess I take it that you had a nice Christmas with lots of good food and chilling with the farm and thing, don't it? Yup, it was pretty good. How about you? You know, same. It was nice linking up with the relatives I don't get to see too often and chilling out and thing. Of course we haven't forgotten about those over in the West who are still rebuilding after the hurricane and big up to those of you who took time to go down there and spend some Christmas
