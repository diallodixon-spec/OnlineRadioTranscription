20251230 142717 We live like this forever. It's fine by me. And it's never easy. Darling, believe me, I'm as skeptical as you. When I think of life without us, it seems like what we're supposed to do But I don't wanna come too strong Just say it is fine by me If you'll never leave We can live like this forever It's fine by you When you're ready come and get it When you're ready, come and get it
