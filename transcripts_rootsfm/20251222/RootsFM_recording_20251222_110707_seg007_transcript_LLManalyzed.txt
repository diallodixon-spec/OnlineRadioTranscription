20251222 110707 Dr. Shaw? Yes, great. Great having you here with us today. As I read and I was thinking about the great person you are in terms of the accomplishments that you would have had. I'm just saying that the women of Jamaica are strong women, whether we are leading in our churches or we're leading in our homes or in our businesses, or even in the educational system that is in Jamaica. And I just want to laud all women this morning and to say welcome again to Beyond the Prescription, Dr. Faisi Shaw. Thank you so much Dr. Mullins. I endorse all of what you just said. We are strong, we are leaders and you know we try to take on this journey for ourselves and for families and so on that represent us. Thank you again for the introduction. Yes, thank you so very much.
