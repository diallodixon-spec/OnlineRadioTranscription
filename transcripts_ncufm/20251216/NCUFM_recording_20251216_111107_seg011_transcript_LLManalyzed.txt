20251216 111107 You walk through the fire You shall not be burned And the flame won't cancel on you Though you're threatened by pain And though shame knows your name My, will pull you through You can find hope in Jesus You can pull strength from his loving arms He'll put the pieces of your life together and give you a brand new start. Stars will never give up on you.
