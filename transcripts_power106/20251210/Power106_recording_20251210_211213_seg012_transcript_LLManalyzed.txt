Hello. Hello. Yeah. Good night, pastor. My dear sir, how are you? Um, first time caller. Oh my goodness, it's good to hear from you. Okay, I listen to you every night, but I can't get to you. But you're fortunate tonight. Okay, okay. So what are you doing, sir? Huh? How are you doing? I am, I am doing well. Okay, I did get a little damage in this time, but thank God I am back on foot. All right, all right, that's what I want to hear. Okay, I'm living in the Chilani area. Yes, so what... South Chilani. In South Chilani?
