20251225 113017 I kissed you, and then it happened It took me by surprise, I knew that you felt it too By the look in your eyes, sweeter than wine And softer than the summer night Everything I want, I have Whenever I hold it tight, this magic moment While your lips are close to mine We'll last forever Forever till the end of time Oh, time Oh, time My love is till the end of time. I got a girl on the other side.
