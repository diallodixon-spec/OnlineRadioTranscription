20251215 212717 What we gonna do now? Start a wine on it. I say compromise on it. Baby, spend time on it. I said compromise on it. Can we talk some business? You know I want your company. And it's nothing too risky. Limited liability. Don't worry. If you try all the things I like, you could still shy in the morning So don't feel away You don't like the fast life But look on the bright side, girl I go take the blame I just want you come and light it up Just a little whine then I'll say Come and meet me at the end You chuck it, we rev it up Say hold it, keep throwin' it Back to the way you stopped us up Baby no way, we could post up All the pictures you want When you're ready I could overshare, darling
