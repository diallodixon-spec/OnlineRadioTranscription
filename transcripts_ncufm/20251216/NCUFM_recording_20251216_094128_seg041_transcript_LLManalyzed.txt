20251216 094128 Get up get up time is running out it's time to answer the call you don't have to be afraid There is no time to play around, you might just get left behind When the battle is over and God calls his soldiers home to rest It's time to rise! Arise, mighty warriors, your strength rising on! The harvest is ripe, the labors are fueled! Heaven is counting, counting, counting on you!
