At 7.49, it's time for your sports update. Football is where we go first. Manchester City star striker Khadija Bonishaw is back in Jamaica's national squad as the Brexit girls open their their Concordia qualification campaign for the 2027 FIFA Brilliance World Cup. Jamaica faces Dominica this weekend at the Darren Stanley Stadium in St. Lucia. Shaw last suited up for Jamaica in December, scoring a second half brace in the reggae girls' 3-0 defeat over South Africa in Montego Bay. This would be her first appearance in more than a year. They'd be able to qualify for a third straight FIFA Women's World Cup, and topping their first round group would also secure a historic first ever berth in the Congress of Women's Championship.
