20251217 165636 Won't you be my lover? Can't seem to get no rest at night. Thinking how you make me feel so right. Well, I've never passed the chance to make you mine. You're so fine. Yes, you are. Out of all the things that I could dream of, you're no more. Just smile for me and let the day begin. You are the sunshine that lights my heart within, yeah. And I know that you're an angel in the sky. Come take my hands and together we will fly. All the wings of love.
