20251226 183421 I'm not gonna worry I know that you've got me right inside the palm of your hand Each and every moment What's good and what gets broken Happens just the way you think You are here You're real I know I can trust you Even when it hurts Even when it's hard Even when it all just falls apart I will run to you Cause I know that you are Lover of my soul Healer of my scars You stay in my heart
