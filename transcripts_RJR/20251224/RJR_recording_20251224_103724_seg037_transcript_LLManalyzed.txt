20251224 103724 from Melbourne. Good on ya. By the time you get this text we'll be way over the hill of sleep. I did like your chat with Derek on the reference to the African state. It was very enlightening and the awareness of what's going on. All the very best to you and your family for the holidays. Big up in a George and your family and you know any other Jamaicans who are around you who you link up with in Australia okay I'm talking to you, Dr. Taylor. From Islington. Yes, sir. Where are you going? I want to wish you a Merry Christmas. Also, Mr. Mullins, Miss Emily, Miss Lucy, Mr. Daniel. Mm hmm.
