20251212 161106 my cry and if I ever let you down my friend it was a misunderstanding so therefore took it for granted then I promise from today I'll go drunk like I never drunk waved like I never waved wine like I never won before just to show you I'm sorry, I'm sorry and I need you back in my life. Look at people by the truck. Emotions running high. We are up in the sky. Taste running down we high. Can't you tell that we sorry? to me. I need time, not place to go. Come to me, come to me. Come to me.
