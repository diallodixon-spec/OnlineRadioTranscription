20251230 152622 Power 106 I'm a Panjolica I'm a son of the sun I love the sea, I love the sun, Lord I love this land Don't matter where I go, Jamaica is my home I love the girls, who cannot bother on where I'm from I hear some people say they are going away. But if I even leave, I won't be going away to stay. I'm a banjo beater. I'm a solo beater.
