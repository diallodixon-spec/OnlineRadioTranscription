20251226 180708 in our other homes. We're more concentrating on our outreach program to help the communities around where our homes are, obviously keeping up the day-to-day care. Business Manager for the Mustard Seed Communities, David Silvera. More than 400 homeless people were treated to a bit of Christmas cheer yesterday during the Kingston and St. Andrew Municipal Corporation's annual Christmas Day feeding program. Those in attendance were served a meal and given gifts at Water Lane in downtown Kingston. Chief Executive Officer of the Kingston and St Andrew Municipal Corporation, Robert Hill, is reiterating the appeal for charitable groups and individuals to follow the procedure for feeding the homeless. Mr Hill says the programme, facilitated through the Poor Relief Department, will eliminate the disorder that currently exists. Mr Hill says the issues are continuous challenges, which the KSAMC has been trying to minimise. On many occasions we find that independent actors are feeding the homeless.
