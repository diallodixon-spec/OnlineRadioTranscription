All the best to your listeners as well. Thank you very much sir. Same to you, thank you. Okay, so Dr. Riley, just to remind our listeners, how do the substances regulate your authority? What is it that you do, that organization? You know, the HSRAs, they have very critical and crucial role in Jamaica. And what we look on, we regulate what they call high energy radiation, and that is the type of radiation that can penetrate the skin, penetrate the body, and can do harm in terms of different modifications to the DNA and so forth. So ionization radiation starts for us to start at x-rays. So we are doing x-rays, we are doing radioactive materials.
