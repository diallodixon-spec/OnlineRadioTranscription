20260101 182819 afternoon so we're talking about what we're leaving behind what we're moving forward with I want to remind you that we should carry forward what strengthens us leave behind what drains us and let's step into the new year with purpose with faith and with courage yeah Isaiah 43 18 and 19 says remember ye not the former things neither consider the things of the whole of old behold I will do a new thing. Now I shall spring forth. Shall ye not know it? I will even make a way in the wilderness and rivers in the desert. Drive them, family. It's tough sometimes to pick up new habits and drop the old habits. Somebody's listening to me. They're plagued with addiction. They have their favorite secret sin that they're holding on to. This evening I pray that God will convict us and make it known to us and we will be of a heart so repentant.
