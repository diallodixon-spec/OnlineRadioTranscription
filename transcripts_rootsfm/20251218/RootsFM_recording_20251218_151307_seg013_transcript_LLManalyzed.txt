20251218 151307 Genius of love, Tom Tom Club. What you gonna do for the Christmas? Ladies, do you wanna love me? Uh-oh. is no end Time isn't present in that dimension You take my arm When I'm walking, rolling and rocking This one time I'm glad I'm not a man Feels like I'm dreaming but I'm not sleeping I'm in heaven
