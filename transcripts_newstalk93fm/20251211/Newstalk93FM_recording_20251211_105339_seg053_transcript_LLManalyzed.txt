I'm going to beat you on Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and I'm going to defeat you twice on Sundays. So let me say this to you. There is no square inch of Jamaica that will not be governed and administered by the Andrew Wallace led government of Jamaica. I'm beating you every day and twice on Sunday sir. Don't you believe that, don't you believe that congratulations should be in offer, in the offer for Chief Currie who said to the government that listen they have the manpower to carry out the necessary repair down there. There are other parts of Jamaica that is in need of more help so deploy the soldiers. Mr. O'Brien, you see the reroofing as part of Jamaica's resilience building, the reroofing is to be done to certain specifications Mr. O'Briain.
