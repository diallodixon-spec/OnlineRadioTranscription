2025-12-12 13:57:39 I am sitting across from the lovely Dr. Maria Myers-Hamilton. She's the managing director here at the SMA. Good morning. Good morning to you and good morning to your team. Have blessings and thank you for being here with us today. Thank you for being the spearhead of this initiative so we could be here to send out the information. So I want to ask you, what inspired Spectrum Management Authority to host this webinar sphere? Excellent question. So this is not the first time that we've done this. We have done this on a number of occasions. If you go back to COVID, when we had, you know, curses locked to me, we actually brought curses over and over again.
