2025-12-12 15:11:18 Whenever we up in this bed and my fingers fall in your hair I wonder if you'd tell me why you're new Cause I can't go at night without your love and got me looking at this phone Every time it rains I hope it's you, girl Got me racing for your love and I Falling for you, I can't lie I just wanna be with you And yes, she got me there, I said it Somebody call the paramedics Tell them to hurry up and come through I can't breathe when you touch me. I suffocate when you're away from me. So much love you take from me.
