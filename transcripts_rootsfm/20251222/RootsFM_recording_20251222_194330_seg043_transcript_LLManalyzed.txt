Finally, it's happening to me Right in front of my face And I just cannot hide it Meeting Mr. Right, the man of my dreams The one who shows me true love Or at least it seems With brown, cool, cool skin And curly, black hair It's just the way he looks at me That gentle love love and stare. Finally, hey, you come along. The way I feel about you just can't be wrong. If you only knew the way I felt about you. I just can't describe it. Oh, no, no.
