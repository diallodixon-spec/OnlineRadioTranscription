I can see the government Governments take on it, especially where the land taxes are standing for many years Let me pause again doesn't have anything to do with property taxes However, it seems a bad practice where someone has paid their funds in acquiring the said property, in addition to paying the annual land tax, seeing that government land has a 60-year time frame. Listen, the government is always going to protect itself, you know, so I'm not surprised that the law would be 60 years for government property, but 12 years for privately owned property. And again, of course, this is unfortunate. You spend your hard-earned money, you buy property, you pay your property taxes, but we cannot get stuck on that. Too many of us are stuck on the property taxes. In the grand scheme of things, when it comes to adverse possession, property taxes mean nothing. Because, like I say, you're paying your property taxes but you haven't seen the property in 20 years.
