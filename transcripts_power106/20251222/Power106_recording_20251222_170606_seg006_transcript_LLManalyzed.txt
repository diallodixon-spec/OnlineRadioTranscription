20251222 170606 recorded some 177 murders when compared to 337 for the corresponding period of 2024. And this is suggesting that we managed to save 160 lives or had a 47.5% reduction in our murders. This, I must hasten to point out, represents an unhistorical achievement whereby it is the lowest number of murders being reported across area 4 within the last 31 years. I am more than pleased that our concerted efforts are yielding the desired results and this significant drop represents the very good and sustained efforts by the entire team and others who supports us. Head of the area for police headquarters assistant commissioner Michael Fitt.
