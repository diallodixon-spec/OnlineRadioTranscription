20251222 093927 It's kissing Santa Claus! I saw Mommy kissing Santa Claus Kissing, kissing Santa Claus Underneath a mess so cold as mine She didn't see me creep Down the stairs to have a pee She thought that I was tucked up In my bed so fast asleep Then I saw Mommy tickle Santa Claus Underneath his big, so small voice Oh, what a rabbit would it be If they had only seen Mommy kissing Santa Claus
