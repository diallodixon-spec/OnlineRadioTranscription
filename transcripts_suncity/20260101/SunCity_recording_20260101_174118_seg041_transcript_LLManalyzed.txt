20260101 174118 Reminiscence of love as I watch for season. It comes over to breeze and chills the air and just the snows. And I imagine kissing you under the missing stones. When springtime exits, we're here loving only by the absence of your perfume. When sorrow burns with heat, I always get the hots for you Oh, skinny, we've been in the ocean Where we used to do Not a chance to leave the cheese a bit When you're not here, it doesn't feel the same Doesn't feel the same?
