20251226 190101 Don't cry for a soldier Cause the warm is not over Keep it to us for the good days The ocean and the sun rays Live love and be strong Memories will live on Not here but not gone No life still goes on So smoke one for me so smoke one for me, just smile now. Draw your eyes, for me. Celebrate my life, cause it's a celebration. Make this a celebration. It's gonna be alright.
