============================================================

I don't want your love. I don't want you here. I don't trust people who say you go to jail. If I test them, I test if they're going to fail. And if they know you don't like, no give no hell All who see don't call me name, who no feel love me Because you know I no know who no never grow me Faith friends, me no want them surround me And if you not do the right thing, love me, love me Love me now, love me now Love me, love'm here to pay me bill.
