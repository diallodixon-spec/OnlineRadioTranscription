20251215 182215 from what government is doing. Now when government says, we are not gonna have any Christmas parties, so our staff are not gonna get an opportunity to take a break, to clear their head, to celebrate the work they have done over the year, or to let their hair down a little bit, but you need to do it, and you need to get your staff and your people to get involved. That creates some amount of confusion. Now, I understand that government would think that people are going to say the money can be used elsewhere. We know that a lot of these activities have separate budgetary line items. They come from sometimes staff sports club funds and staff put their monies together to get these things done. But if they are banned, it don't matter where the money is coming from. Right? So I'm saying this is not coming from government capital spending.
