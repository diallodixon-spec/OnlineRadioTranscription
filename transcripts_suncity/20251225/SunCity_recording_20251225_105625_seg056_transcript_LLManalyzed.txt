20251225 105625 This Christmas ends as I look around me. Your eyes may outshine the time they don't. This Christmas, by a sign blazing bright, we carol through the night. And this Christmas will be a very special Christmas for me. Shake a hand, shake a hand. Merry Christmas all over the land. Oh, it's Christmas time. It's Christmas time.
