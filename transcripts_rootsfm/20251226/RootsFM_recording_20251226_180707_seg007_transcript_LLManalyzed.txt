20251226 180707 I'll never go back to that door Although you've got your choice Please make sure the first is secure I'll make my sacrifice Only you, no one before What will it take my love to show you I'm still in love with you What will it take My love to show you How much my love is true The feeling she gave to me Makes me feel so brand new To love you forever There's no other like you Baby, no one but you Many a times I tried it Baby I can't deny it I just can't live my life A day in this world without you What will it take my love to show you
