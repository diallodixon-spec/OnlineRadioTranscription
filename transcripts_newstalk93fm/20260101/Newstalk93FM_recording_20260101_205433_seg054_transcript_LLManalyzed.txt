20260101 205433 Oh my, oh my, my love I take one look at you, you're taking me out of the ordinary I want you laying me down to the dead and buried On the edge of your knife, staying drunk on your vine The angels up in the clouds are jealous, knowing we've found something so out of the ordinary. You got me kissing the ground of your sanctuary. Shatter me with your touch, oh Lord, return me to dust. The angels up in clouds are jealous, knowing we've found hopeless hallelujah. Hopeless hallelujah. Hopeless out of heaven's gate. Oh, my life, I'll do you. Breathe and take my breath away.
