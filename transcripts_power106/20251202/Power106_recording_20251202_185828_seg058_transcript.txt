cost a lot of us who is in the industry. We sympathize with them, but the business continues and we're asking that FDRAL get the pool up and running so people can have their investments properly protected. Alright, that should be the date of the sale and the auctioneer, but then how am I going to go down? The sale starts at 12 on the 7th of December. You know, the auctioneer is Wiley. Brian, you know the voice that people love and he will be the auctioneer this year. We start at 12 and we hope to have persons come out on that day to support the sale because you know the sale is very important to Tuba and it's also important to the industry. So we're asking all players to come out and give big support or great support to the sale. Mr Desmond Lewis, one of the directors of Tuba, thank you very much sir.
