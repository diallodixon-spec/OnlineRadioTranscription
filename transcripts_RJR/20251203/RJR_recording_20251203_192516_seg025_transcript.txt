============================================================

That would be beautiful, but you know that requires a lot of hard work, a lot of consistency. And I'm definitely doing the best I'm able. I'm putting out the best of me and I have a lot of things in store. People might be wondering how I'm so quiet now, but I've been working on a lot of stuff. I don't know if I can drop any bombshells, but just as a teaser, I've had the honor and privilege of connecting with legends. I can't overstate this. Legends in the reggae industry who have done, you know, wondrous things for the music. Wondrous things for the culture. Marcia Griffiths, for example, and Maxick Priest, they've extended their hand to me to collaborate with them. So I have a lot of stuff in the works. That's amazing.
