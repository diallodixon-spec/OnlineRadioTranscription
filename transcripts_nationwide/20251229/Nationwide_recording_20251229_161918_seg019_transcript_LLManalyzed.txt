20251229 161918 When I don't want to, I make someone else some kind of unknowable You make me stay, waiting, I should not Are you so strong, or is the weakness in me? Why do you come here, and pretend to leave just passing by? But I need to see you, and I need to hold you tightly, amen. Feeling guilty, worried, waking from torment to see. This hard love has me bound, but a new love cuts deep If I choose her now, I lose out, cause what of us has to fall? I need you, and you, oh, why do you?
