2025-12-11 18:34:59 All right, time now for another edition of the Auto World here on Power 106 FM. My name is Jesse Blakin for your regular host, Shelly Ann McLagan. Shelly will return come Monday. Well, today we'll bring to you yet another installment in our international automotive industry focus. And in today's edition, Germany is pressing to soften the European Union's 2035 ban on new combustion engine vehicles, arguing that hybrids, range extenders and synthetic fuels deserve room in the transition. Industry leaders and trade unions warn that the rush to battery electric leaves traditional auto suppliers and jobs in peril. We'll now bring to you a discussion between media personality with German news outlet DW Steve Bearsley. He spoke to Andres Hermann, director of the Institute for Mobility.
