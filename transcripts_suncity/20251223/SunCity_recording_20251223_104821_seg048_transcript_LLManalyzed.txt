20251223 104821 I love you like you know And it's insane, I keep finding ways to change the place All these sad memories were once the time Reality, no matter how I try I know my life will never be the same You made your choice and I will not complain Please don't raise your voice Please don't say my name Just say goodbye It's too late to lie Na na na na na na nitty boy Ja ja ja ja ja, you never let me down Na na na na, nitty boy, Ja ja never let me down
