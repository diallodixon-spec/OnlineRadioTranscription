we will look at a critical important aspect that relates to mental health to include awareness and psychosocial issues. Our aim is to promote holistic wellbeing among not just credit union members, but Jamaicans in general. Our guest on the show today is clinical psychologist from Tea House Therapy, Sonia Winter, who will help us to better understand a lot of things that may be troubling a person's mind and hindering their physical and social well-being at this time. Sonia, welcome to the Credit Union Vibes. Thank you so much, Katrina. Thanks for inviting me. I really appreciate it. Great. The hurricane has passed, but the dreadful memory still lingers. Some persons may be having a challenge acknowledging some of their feelings and wondering if these feelings are quote unquote normal. What are some of the normal feelings that people may be experiencing at this time?
