The new clerk has no other choice but to work with who you are, what you have, and start doing through a process of abiding by the rules and regulations of government, both in terms of repurposing the institution and fit for purpose individuals, as well as understanding that once you receive all of it, the buck is going to stop with you, and the longer you're there, you now have to hub up it that you inherited. I'm proud of the work done by the clerk so far, because in a very short order, students now face an extensive audit. The primary issue I saw identified with the credit card on the master of transport is an error where the Parliament wrote a letter, the bank did the transaction incorrectly.
