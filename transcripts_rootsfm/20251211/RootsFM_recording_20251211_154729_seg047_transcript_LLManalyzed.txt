2025-12-11 21:42:22 I'll tell you all the time You had my heart a long, long time ago In case you didn't know The way you looked tonight That second glass of wine That did it There is something about that kiss, girl, it didn't mean Got me thinking I'm thinking All of the things that I've been feeling, feeling, feeling. Hmm, this time you'll hear him in case you didn't know. Baby, I'm crazy about you. And I would be lying if I said that I could.
