20251216 162215 What a beautiful lady On and on She drives me crazy On and on And there's no hipster, baby, she goes On and on Like a volcano she erupts Blowing up my pages Every minute, every hour I realize she likes my stuff I chose the right flavor This moment's gonna save her Lord, I've never trusted pretty smiles Cause looks so deceiving You're listening to what my other profile Girls are misleading Lesson learned, don't judge a book by looking at the cover. You know. She drives me crazy. On and on and on. What a beautiful lady. On and on.
