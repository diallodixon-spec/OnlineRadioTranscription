20251225 120806 Make me a proud mother Let me see you grow To be a good man That's all I ask The beat of the drum The strumming of the bass guitar The unison of the keyboard The steadiness of the rhythm guitar Energy from the percussion And the voice cementing the sound. This is reggae music. The coming together of swords uniting the world in harmony and peace. It's Lovers Thursday. Captivating your mind, body and soul. Lovers Thursday.
