20251215 161916 I was able to reach you on time and we've reached the end time and I thought it would have been one song. Mm hmm. So, I sang me one song, put everything in the one song. Apparently there was a little delay so they called me again. The music was ready so we have to sing acapella to the music ready. That was something. Wow. Wow. But you're you're always ready. It's good to be ready. That's it. Good to be ready. The Bible says you must be always ready. In season. And out of season. Exactly. Alright. Good. Your your album, His Goodness, has received great feedback. What's the message that you hope that your listeners who listened to it when it was just released and even new listeners would get from His Goodness?
