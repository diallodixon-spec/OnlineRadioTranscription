So let me set it up like that. So in terms of Africa's ability to not just only feed itself, but develop independently on its own, it just takes a mind shift. It takes a shift away from the mindset of dependency, right? Because basically, the structure is in Africa and also in Jamaica. We grow the food and we send it abroad. So therefore, the people, the metropoles, like the metropoles simply mean if your former colonizer was France, the metropole would be France or Britain, et cetera. So the whole idea is to feed those places first. And the entire economy is psychology is about that. Take care of the metropole first. So with that philosophy and psychology, you will have a gap in your own security in terms of food.
