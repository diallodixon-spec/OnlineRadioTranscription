20251216 140202 is as the ATP has confirmed it will introduce an extreme heat rule from the 2026 season, allowing players on the men's tour to take a 10-minute cooling break during best of three set singles matches when conditions become dangerous. The move mirrors a long-standing WTA policy that has been in place since 1992 and is designed to better protect players competing in increasingly intense weather conditions. The issue gained renewed attention at October's Shanghai Masters, where temperatures reached 34 degrees Celsius with high humidity, forcing several players to seek medical assistance. Under the new policy, cooling breaks may be requested when the wet bulb globe temperature WBGT, a measure of heat stress combining temperature, humidity, wind and sunlight, reaches 30.1 degrees Celsius. Players will be permitted to hydrate, change clothing, shower and receive medical supervision. If WBGT readings exceed 32.2 degrees, play will be suspended entirely.
