it's so important what is their attitude of the family and how family facilitates and assist them. So what is your circumstance and whether you agree with what I just said? Well, I do agree. I do agree. The fortunate thing for me, though, is that I've always had a very supportive family ever since I was young. You know, for example, my grandfather, he would always tell me that I can see one day you'll be one of the greats, one of the Stevie Wonder's, one of the great-childs of the world. And even at that time, I wasn't really particularly focused on music. I just used to sing as a child. But my family, they always saw my talent and they encouraged it. They've never been the type of individuals to coddle me. Regardless of my disabilities, they've always made it a point for me to go off and explore. For example, I went to the Salvation Army School for the Blind.
