20251224 205739 Why don't you give love on Christmas day The man on the street and the couple upstairs All need to know there's someone who cares Give love on Christmas day No greater gift is inner love People you don't know smile and are hello Everywhere there's an air of Christmas joy It's that once a year when the world seems to end You wish you could have more than just presents from a store Why don't you give love a Christmas gift?
