20260102 124728 beautiful beautiful life that shimmers that innocent light back like when we were young every youngest child felt they were raised up in the wild but now you're home cause I'm not a bad bitch and this isn't savage And I'm never gonna let you down I'm never gonna leave you out So many traitors, smooth operators But I'm never gonna break that bow I'm never never gonna leave you now, now, now. I'm gonna break that bow. Never gonna leave you. Now, now.
