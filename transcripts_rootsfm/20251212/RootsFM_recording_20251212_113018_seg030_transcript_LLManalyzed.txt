So when the hurricane was coming and her husband was away because he could get back to Jamaica in time, between her husband and myself, we decided that we don't want her going through the trauma with three little girls alone. So we made plans for her to go somewhere else during the hurricane. No, those are the kind of decisions we can make. Go somewhere else that you pretty much guarantee that building cannot be touched by a hurricane. So look at the success stories of your girls. Look at the success story, you know what I'm saying? No, but it was, it's Gilbert who caused it. That's what I'm saying, out of a major tragedy. Yes, yes. Yeah, success story came out of that. They're moving to a whole other, and the other thing about it, it was during that time period when they were away and back and forth window I started the night doctor show because I started writing for all the papers because I get out all the time in the world
