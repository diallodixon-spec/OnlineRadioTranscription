20251217 092919 down to Westmoreland tomorrow. Thank you so much. You've heard Mr. Borrell Scarlett on this program. He's of Evergrow Garden Center and they are also title sponsors for the broadcast tomorrow. I expect to have the National Housing Trust on board as well. I'm just waiting for the final confirmation there from Mr. Dwayne Burbick and the National Identification and Registration Authority, NERA, formerly the Registrar General's Department, they'll be sending down some forms with us so that we can complete for the individuals and have them sign those who've lost their birth certificates and need to get it back. Yes, so we've tried to think of all that the people in Grange and the surrounding communities need so that we can go down and do what we need to do. So we look forward to going down very early tomorrow and to bring you that
