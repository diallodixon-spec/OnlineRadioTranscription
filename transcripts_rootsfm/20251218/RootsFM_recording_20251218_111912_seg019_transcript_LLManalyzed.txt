20251218 111912 yes so he's always going there and enjoying himself i i will cook at new year's day because i i i'm not a food person i don't love a lot of food so what will happen is that you you'll realize that i'll it's like some people cook about six five different some five meat and all them things also i don't know if it's age for me i would prefer to have some salt fish and some green plant in our okay heavy heavy heavy stuff and if I want the rice and peas not too much rice so for me you know to indulge in that big cooking who's gonna eat it so that's one of the things and I can do it very well. You're a good cook. I don't know if it's old I'm getting or what, but I like the season, don't get it? Yeah, yeah. I love it because I like to see the people. I realized that it's a holiday that gives out a lot of love. You see
