20251222 113122 I've been trying so hard just to make it home through You know I'm trying to live the way you want me to I want to say goodbye to all the sin inside I don't want to miss that great glory ride So when you break home through that golden sky Please slow it down, don't pass me by Swing that new chariot way down low I want to look like Elijah when to heaven in the morning right on King Jesus right on King Jesus
