20251231 190004 So at this time, at any festive time with meals, let us be mindful of moderation. And your goal is, at the end of the day, portion control and mindful choices. I use the word mindful choices because you want to make sure that even when you're eating, remember also, when I said mention festive meals, remember you mentioned food I had laced with alcohol, but so is your sorrel, your eggs, your sauces, your creamy desserts, your, you know what I mean? I could go on and on and what has, your macaroni, cheeses, your, everything is so filled with so many different delicacies, which we would not have used to use. So I guess, like everything else, it's portion size, so our large or large, so mindful of what we use. So today, yesterday we went to a meal, roti, rice and peas, potato salad, macaroni and cheese. So limit all your starches for us, for carbohydrates, we want proteins, protein is fine. Yes.
