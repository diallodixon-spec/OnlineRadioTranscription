I love the way that you bring a vibe With your hands them up in the sky Rollin' back and havin' a're climbing again, and we have money to spend. Yes, we jammin' down to the end. See me with me cannibal friend. Oh, me cannibal friend, I wish it come from me. London, I wish it comes from me. New York, I wish it came from me.
