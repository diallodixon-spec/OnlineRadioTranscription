Listen, I wish I could buy one out of season. But don't, well, no, no, hesitate, like me now. Because your love just won't wait. Just won't wait. Ooh, baby, I love you way, every, every day. I want to tell you I love you way. I wanna tell you how I love your little ways. I wanna be with you night and day, every love you, baby. Oh, I love your little ways, yeah. I want to tell you I love you.
