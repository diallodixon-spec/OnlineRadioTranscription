And if you see my body, don't shake it When film get crazy Make me f*** in a list from a party Me come in on my hand from a hip Me stop wine, make a gal man see The crowd rake all eyes on me Watch the one ya, hold the one ya This a one a name wine, wine Me got tricks, me that slick, full of dirty Driving through Kingston, who do this? You not ready? Let's go! Feel over and shake it Take that sweat till it wash where your lace weak And the make up, that not feel sweet Cause me a hot girl, and me no lazy Vibrate when a man get crazy
