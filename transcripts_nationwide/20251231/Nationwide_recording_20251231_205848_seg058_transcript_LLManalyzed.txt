20251231 205848 I'm a big fan of The Six. Big Breeze. Open the damn tone my boy. Yes, done. One thing about it. I disdain. I'm going to say it and I've always said it. God take you from your current situation. You've, you know about sufferation. You come from nothing. I'm always going to say it. I know someone is going to say, yeah man, but keep, you know, keep the man to my own for protection. They are absolutely protection services being offered by private entities. When they make money, they make food, and they realize that God has blessed them immensely. They can take their family out to the garrison, and they can buy the house and the cars, and they can provide for their family, and can provide for their kids and food constantly can dip on the table and the bills they can pay and you know your wildest mind like these are things that you didn't even know was attainable or achievable in any capacity but I would not always fall victim to the same script
