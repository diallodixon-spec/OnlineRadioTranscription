20251219 212819 So sweet, so sweet, so sweet Every time he passed me skin me teeth We had the melody and he might defeat us so we greet Waiting for the right one is the hardest thing I've done If I knew that you were right there then I'd never write this song Joy is yours and mine, story of our love, so nice, so nice Never catch a vibe that feels so the teeth. Me and the melody and the mad the beat are so quickly. You are the one, the only one me have to confess.
