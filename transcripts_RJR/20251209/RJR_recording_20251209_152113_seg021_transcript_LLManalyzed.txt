Oh, what a little island nice. From the beaches to the rivers to the island spice. And we liquor but we taller. Leader we no follower. And every hard woman know for one point time. And that fund them up still regardless where you know gonna lay on the one mark us gave it. Well class coffee and cocoa them call chocolate and fresh jelly water to wash off my heart with blood. Fly all around, but we'll leap a town. Collect no fuel, a one pound, but them no nice like Jamaica. No we no up like jamaica i been all round the world see no leaper girl i ain't no diamond and pearl but dem no like jamaica now we no street like jamaica
