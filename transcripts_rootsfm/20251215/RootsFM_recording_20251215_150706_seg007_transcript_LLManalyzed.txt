20251215 150706 And some of prayer They know some hungry, but never offer me food They'd rather judge me and call me a fool True, I never got them big school You have me as footstool But the camel will enter the needle faster than them because they're evil. And I say, where there's a will, there's a way. And I know that I have plans for me. No, we never born for something. We never born for fail. And in the near future, we gonna see brighter days. The poor man pray for riches, but when him get it, will him them badger. The wealthy man in an skyscraper, feel like saying my God.
