So, for example, people who are found trespassing on somebody's farm at night would carry a penalty of about $40,000 or the maximum that it would be. Now we've moved up to $3 million. I can't, as a way to deter people from, even if you, you know, sometimes you don't catch them in act of stealing But why would you have right to be on somebody's farm at that part of the night? So in essence what we're doing is strengthening the penalties and framework around to fight for the last week and minister that those are the Monetary penalties, but what about jail time? Where are we looking at in terms of when those individuals simply say well I don't I can't pay the fine how much time would they end up serving. So again what you found with a lot of these the fines were 20 to 40 thousand and there was no jail time
