but really and truly, I just wanna big up the whole Jamaica, big up the whole Montego Bay for always standing behind me, the whole Harbor Street craft market, because I was a baby in every single person's hand in that craft market. They really looked out for me for every step of the way, and they're still putting their full 100% support behind me. So the whole Jamaican, the whole Montego Bay, my whole family, friends abroad and a yard. And the list keeps going on. But it sounds like your mom has been with you all this time. You've been living with her. Yes, yes. Because she's in the States too. Right. It's because of her that I'm here. She decided, OK, opportunities are, opportunities are abroad and my children need to have it and I'm going abroad for them and she did what she had to do and, you know, I have to reward her for it.
