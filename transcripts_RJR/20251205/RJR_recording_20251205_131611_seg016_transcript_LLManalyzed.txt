After a hurricane, keeping babies nourished and protected is more important than ever. Mothers with young babies should continue breastfeeding as breast milk is safe, clean, and strengthens your baby's immunity. If you're expressing breast milk and have no electricity, use the milk within four hours. You can also store it in a glue with ice. This keeps breast milk safe for up to one day. Breastfeeding supports your baby's health even during tough times. A message from the Minister of Health and Wellness and UNICEF.
