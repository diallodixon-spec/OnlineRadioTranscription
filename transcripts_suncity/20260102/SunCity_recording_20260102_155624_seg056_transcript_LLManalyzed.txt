20260102 155624 my baby said he loved me my baby said he need me gonna eat sleep and breathe me out till the end but then my baby went back I guess he had a real love had to sneak cheat and bring me down it had to end my baby falls asleep in his bed Fingertips on the edge He left me for a girl, but he regrets leaving me And I hope it hurts like hell You should've never let me go I know I'm messing up your mind But never got you good this time And I hope it hurt like hell
