20260102 164533 I have 9, I have 13. I'm going to go back and count again. Oh my gosh, oh my gosh. So that was Milk and Honey. Other than the same dress, to be honest with you, I don't know if a woman can flap out those things on Milk and Honey. For me, it seemed underwhelming. But I've never seen all of them, so I can't say for sure. It's just so funny how the men went all out for a fashion party like this and some of the women did just I don't know if some of them did make them close to them yard so I feel like they just got pigs and pablos and they asked them how much yard of material they want and they just say yes they don't give them no, they just say yes and they just go and put all their material together and just wear it. The girls have lost the platinum, I don't care about that. They never see the platinum in the first place, they never have it for last year. They did not see the blueprint. I feel like some of them never have the light, two minutes have just come so I don't know if some of them don't have the light and they just get dressed in a headdress.
