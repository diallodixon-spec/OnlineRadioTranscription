**Interview with June Parrott: Hurricane Relief and Resilience**

In a heart-wrenching interview on Radio Jamaica's "Hotline" program, Dr. Orville Taylor spoke with June Parrott, a resident of Ginger Hill, who shared her harrowing experience during Hurricane Melissa. Parrott recounted how she and her family, including her two grandchildren, took shelter in their concrete home, which withstood the storm's fury. However, her daughter's house and her brother's house were not as fortunate, leaving them without a place to live.

Parrott expressed her gratitude for the assistance she received from Trans Jam's hurricane relief program, which provided her with essential materials to repair her home. She praised the program's efficiency, stating that it was "not hard" to get registered and that the process was straightforward. When asked about the impact of the assistance, Parrott said it was a "wonderful stopgap" that helped her family cope with the aftermath of the hurricane.

The conversation also touched on the community's resilience and the importance of helping those in need. Parrott shared how she and her family distributed food and other essentials to their neighbors, highlighting the sense of solidarity and compassion that defined their community's response to the disaster. As Parrott poignantly put it, "We give God thanks that we are alive and we are not dead."

Dr. Taylor also emphasized the significance of programs like Trans Jam's hurricane relief initiative, which aim to support affected communities and facilitate their recovery. The interview served as a testament to the strength and resilience of the human spirit in the face of adversity, as well as the importance of collective efforts to rebuild and support those affected by natural disasters.
