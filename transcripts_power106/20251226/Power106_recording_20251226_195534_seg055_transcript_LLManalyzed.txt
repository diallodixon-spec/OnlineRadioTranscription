20251226 195534 In a gunman world, in the nights in Glock he not work, morrow splat on the toolbox full, the magazine inna the two glock full, and he's watching as the days go by, and he's counting as his peers all die, sleeping with the rifle cross his chest, and so he never gets a good night's rest, and then he's cranky in the morning times And more victims have to lose their lives The community at least stand to hear Wishing that they wasn't in a gunman world In a gunman life He might not come home from work one night So every minute matter ignores advice From From his weeping baby, mother and child That he won't in every game he plays So she know he'll meet his end one day Some juvenile will have to earn his stripe And have to take another gunman's life What if a box stopper names his Christ?
