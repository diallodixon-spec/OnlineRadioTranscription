20251226 092424 Sweet love, you'll be burning up tonight I feel no shame, I'm alone Sweet love, don't you run, I'll come away I'll always be this way You're stronger than I in this world You won't be enough When I'm there, I'm over I don't know where to see, can't be wrong Don't you know this is where you belong I'm a sweet dream, I'm in love with you, baby Stay right right here Never fear, I believe, that you'll be here Never leave, cause, baby, I believe in this love
