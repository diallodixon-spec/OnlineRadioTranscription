20251222 092717 You feel like your faith is dying But please don't give up yet Cause that's just how it goes How life turns, how it rolls Through the fire and through the pain It may hurt, it may bruise, it may leave you confused But you will be okay Cause his kind of love is a love that won't walk away So don't let the rain take your courage Don't let the wind beat you down
