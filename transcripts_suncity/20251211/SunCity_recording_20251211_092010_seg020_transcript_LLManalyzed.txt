so deficient email but what i'm realizing son is that this has been happening for a very long time so i don't know if you guys on social media like tiktok or instagram or you'll get a message from somebody and they'll say hey you know um do you have an ncb account um uh let me send you this or you can get this but then i used to be that this must be a joke because you think I'm just gonna send you an account and you put money in there but that's how they actually do it. They fish for people online as well to um they send the money and like you probably have to send them back a specific amount and you keep some and that's how they transfer the money. It sounds similar to like the lottery scanning. Exactly it's something's something. We'll send you this or you need to send us this for us to send you that. Is that the other way around? It's crazy to me. So for me, I'm like, we have to be on our piece on queues because you think that you cannot be scammed, but it's not what you think.
