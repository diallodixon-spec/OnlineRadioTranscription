20251229 172619 On today's program, we tell you more about the Jamaica Fire Brigade's Hydrant Network. I'm Anjoui James-Soyas. Fire hydrants are an important tool in the work of a firefighter, providing a constant flow of water, which helps personnel respond quickly to fires. Fire trucks typically have about 4,000 liters of water, which can be pumped out in about seven minutes. Without a constant water supply, firefighters would need to make multiple trips to replenish their water. To avoid this, the Jamaica Fire Brigade, JFB, maintains fire hydrants across the island through its Hydrant Maintenance Crew. The members of this crew are responsible for mapping hydrants, assessment and repair, as well as repair and maintenance activities, including replacing parts, clearing, chipping and painting hydrants. We recently signed a memorandum of understanding with the National Water Commission, NWC.
