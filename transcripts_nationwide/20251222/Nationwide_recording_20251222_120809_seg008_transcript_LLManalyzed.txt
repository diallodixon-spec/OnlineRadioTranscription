20251222 120809 or anything in the protection of our citizens of Jamaica. Olivia Grange, Culture Minister. Schools in Western Jamaica are at varying stages of the rebuilding process, as they hustle to be ready for the start of the new school year in January 2026. Nationwide News spoke with the principal of Cornwall College, Michael Ellis, and the man at the helm of William Nim Memorial High, Linvern Wright. While Ellis praised the work of the National Education Trust, Wright says the trust is failing in Western Jamaica, Lacovia High in St. Elizabeth as well as Darleston Primary and Maude McLeod High in Westmoreland. The ministry reported that things such as tent accommodation for students and overall progress of repairs meant that the three schools are set to reopen in early 2020.
