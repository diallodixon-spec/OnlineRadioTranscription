20260102 112514 Let me take the night out of release, friend. And I know that you'll still want to see me. On the Sunday morning music ground loud. Let me love you while the moon is still out. There's something in you. Let up heaven in me. The feeling won't let me sleep Cause I'm lost in the way you move, the way you feel One kiss is all it takes Falling in love with me Possibilities, I look like all you need One kiss is all it takes Fallin' in love with me
