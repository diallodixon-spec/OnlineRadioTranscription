20251226 214437 I had the time in my hustle and hurry world Laughing myself to sleep Waking up lonely I needed someone to hold me all It's such a crazy old town It can drag you down till you run out of dreams So you party all night to the music and lights But you don't know what happiness means I was dancing in the dark with strangers No love around me When suddenly you found me Girl, you're every woman in the world to me. You're my fantasy, you're my reality. Girl you're every woman to me.
