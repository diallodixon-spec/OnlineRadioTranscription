and protect you. In peace, in war, the police reassure to serve and protect, to serve and protect you. Police are everybody's like shining armor. Come to your rescue at the sound of your alarms. Blue and white flashing lights are ringing. Watch all the streets while everyone's asleep. So if you serve, and be proud to be a member, show off your badge, show off your regulation number.

As I raise my right hand and I take this oath to serve and protect, to serve and protect you. In peace, in war, the police react.
