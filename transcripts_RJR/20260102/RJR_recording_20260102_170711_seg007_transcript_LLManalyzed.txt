Opposition spokesperson on National Security Fitz Jackson is calling for an independent and transparent investigation into an incident in which a four-year-old died after being shot during an alleged shootout between members of the security forces and gunmen in Granville, St. James on New Year's Day. In a statement today, Mr. Jackson described the killing of the little boy, Romaine Bowman, as deeply troubling. His 68-year-old grandmother was also wounded in the incident. The circumstances surrounding the operation, which occurred in the Browns Lane area of the community, have raised questions and prompted protests from residents. The police report that two men were fatally shot and a high-powered rifle seized during the operation. Mr. Jackson said while the opposition acknowledges the difficult and often dangerous conditions under which law enforcement operates, particularly during the New Year period, the death of a child.
