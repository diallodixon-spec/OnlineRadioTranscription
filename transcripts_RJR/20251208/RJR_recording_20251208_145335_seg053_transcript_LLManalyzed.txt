I don't want to wake up. So I'm expecting to just sleep away. But then new mercies, it's a different light when I wake up and I see the boys. And I say, you know, them boys, they save me now, them boys. And I see them and I see other kids in them. And that's where Zion comes from. One of, I mean, I consider everybody children as mine. Like I would give anything for people on our world. And they always are a mean and take advantage. But that's on them, that's on them. That's on them. I mean, God has showed up in so many ways for you. He has. Share with us one of those moments that you have just had to step back and just acknowledge.
