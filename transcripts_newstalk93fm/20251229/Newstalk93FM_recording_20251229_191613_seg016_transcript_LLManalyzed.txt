20251229 191613 I feel your frequency from miles away You come alive with one wine baby With you I want to dance the night away One jam turn a lifetime baby So don't feel away You don't like the fast life The look on the bright side I go take the blame I just want you to come and light it up Just a little windin' up Come and meet me behind the truck and we rev it up Whole day Keep keep throwing it back at the wire stop Baby no way, we could post up all the pictures you want When you're ready, I go over here Darling, you go over there But we could meet in the middle and start a war
