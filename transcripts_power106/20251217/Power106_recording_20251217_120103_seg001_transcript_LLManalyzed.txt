20251217 120103 The case of alleged sexual violence against a female student at the College of Agriculture, Science and Education has prompted calls from the opposition for stronger security and enforcement mechanisms at the Portland-based institution. The student was reportedly raped after exiting a taxi and proceeding onto the campus on Sunday. Opposition spokesperson on youth and human rights, Iset Bikanen, says the situation is deeply concerning and unfortunate. Mr. Bikanen adds that sexual violence represents a serious violation of human rights and must be met with decisive, transparent, and compassionate action. I'm formally calling on the Jamaica Constabulary Force to provide timely and appropriate updates on the status of the investigation, with relevant information being communicated to the institution through recognized student bodies, while fully safeguarding the privacy and dignity of the survivor.
