2025-12-12 15:04:31 Tell as we lay in bed all afternoon I dream you now every night My mind is where we love each other And when I'm awake, staring at pictures of you asleep Touching your face, invading your space. They're a part of me. Things that I miss. Things like your funny little laugh, or the way you smile, or the way we kiss. What I've noticed this week, I think you're my week. There's something new every single time that I sit and remember.
