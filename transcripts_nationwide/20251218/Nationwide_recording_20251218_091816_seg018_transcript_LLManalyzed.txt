20251218 091816 road to at one section there that the traffic pileup was caused and so once again expect major delays if you're coming into Kingston from Spanish town from Olaba if you have to go on Spanish town road you are gonna be in for a long wait and as I said the traffic is all the way back up to pass the that is being done maybe they can just get the road covered to an extent until maybe there's less traffic and then they can come back and complete the resurfacing of the road. But that is causing major delay at the moment. On top of the regular traffic that was already on that side of the road in the morning, it is even worse today.
