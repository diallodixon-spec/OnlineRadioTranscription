20251226 165526 I'll move, come on. Bad man party, woman and weapon. Win the first man, make a step on. Wait from second, then I'll express the line. Where you from, where you from? Anywhere, anywhere, me go. I'll see the angry. I'll come back for more, like Debbie. She said yesterday, quarter final. Tonight, I said, me say yesterday, up to the remmage. That's true. Make me dream. Why don't the barbie call? We all got funds. And smoke. See, the doctor said me a black lung. Hey, rule boy, when did that dance? Suck your cock, will you? And will it bounce? Will it bounce? I said, that's when it blunts. Every man want kind of baby. Hear what me say? Whether she a good ass or shitty. I didn't have money, you know. Hurts, curls and reggae. Anyway, do good guy, do me the day. Anyway, tall up, stand up, me the day. Hey! You know what? You should lose a load. So you might be wet. Make it.
