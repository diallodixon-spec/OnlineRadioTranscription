20251222 192512 What can you tell us about the development of abdominals? Are you going to see more crops? Is there a recruitment guide going on? What's happening there to get more teams involved? As you know, it's a work in progress and it's something that we have been putting out there to corporate Jamaica to be on board with us. One of the main issues we had, which we have not seen it for this tournament, which is very good, is the level of indiscipline, which we did not encounter that, which is also good for the competition and the organizers, of course. This competition ran smoothly and as we have seen, we see poor persons came together on a friendly basis even though it was competitive and they also knew what the purpose was which was to come out on Sundays, enjoy yourself, play good domino and win and that was really what happened.
