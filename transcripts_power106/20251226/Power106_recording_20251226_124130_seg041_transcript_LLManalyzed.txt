20251226 124130 I might as well be true to myself Cause I'll never get used to no one else You've been so kind to treat me so fine And I know for me you'd do anything But I've made up my mind I'm just wasting your time Cause I have yet to get over my first love I thought that she was my best friend I don't know where we went wrong Will I ever feel love again?
