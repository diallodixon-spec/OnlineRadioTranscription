Kinda spittin' real king from a record machine It's a good diss to make your hip cats jump and twist and move and groove Great, I tell you Now, never you stand still on the ground, just keep on moving around Stop being a clown Now live a life you love and love a life you live like I would play. Musical disc or the record rock. You can play it by Jack.
