How about the criminals stop shooting? Yes, that's a good one. Good morning, Sir Earl. As a female minister, I want to say that the lady who called on past judgment on all churches shouldn't judge all churches based on her experience. Our church, Alpha and Omega Ministries for Overcomers, gives back, educates, empowers and uplifts our Mountain View community and members way beyond what's collected in our offering plate. Not all churches are the same. We are proof that some are truly making a difference. Thank you, female minister, for sharing that. Good morning, Mr. Earl.
