question in parliament, when can we expect to hear the specifics? So for example, if we're getting, I'm not just using numbers, a billion U.S. from the IMF, what are the terms of that loan? Is there going to be, for example, a moratorium on interest payment for expiry at that time? A principal? No, no, we don't know any of these things. So without that information, it's very difficult to have a meaningful projection of where your debt to GDP is going to go. Right. So don't you believe that was dishonest and sloppy for her to come to the country and telling us that without that information? Well, as I said, I was surprised. And let me tell you why I was surprised. When the Prime Minister spoke the week before and I asked the questions, his response was the Minister of Finance will come the following week to answer my specific questions. So I expected her to be prepared to answer the specific questions.
