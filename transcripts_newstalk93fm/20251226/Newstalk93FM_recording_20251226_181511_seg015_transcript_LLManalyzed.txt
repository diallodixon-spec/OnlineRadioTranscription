20251226 181511 I don't care about the presents Underneath the Christmas tree I just want you for my own More than you could ever know Make my wish come true. All I want for Christmas is you. I don't want a lot for Christmas There is just one thing I need Don't care about the presents Underneath the Christmas tree I don't need to end my stocking Live upon the vine
