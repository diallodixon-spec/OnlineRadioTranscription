20251215 092722 Based on the message in the YouTube chat here, it doesn't sound as if this person had applied for anything. I'm not sure because she's asking how they got her email. So it doesn't sound that if she was, you know, in conversation with anybody. Just be careful. Right. Because what happens, Nora, when you submit an express entry profile, you do get a letter in your inbox that says, yes, this is your express entry profile number and you can start applying for jobs. So it is not illegal to apply for a job when you're outside of Canada. However, of course, it is illegal to start working without the proper documents, because Immigration Canada wants to know that yes at least you have started the process of looking for jobs because then if you do get through with your permanent residency, of course it will make it easier for you to settle into
