It's Inspirational and Motivational Mondays and I have with me Natassia. Do I say Natassia? That is it. Natassia, right. She's Leadership Consultant and Motivational Speaker, speaker, co-founder of MindFood International. She's a United Nations peace ambassador, a governor general awardee, and a PhD candidate in strategic leadership. Her journey from challenge to purpose has inspired audiences across the Caribbean and around the world. So we're very happy to have her today because she's going to help us stretch beyond the setbacks of 2025. We're going to finish December with faith, with resilience, and with renewed intention. Hi, Natasha. Hello. I'm giving thanks. So grateful to be here.
