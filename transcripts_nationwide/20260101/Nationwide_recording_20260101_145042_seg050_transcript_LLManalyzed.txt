20260101 145042 I love the way you look, I love the way how you walk on I love the food you cook, I love the clothes when you have one I love love the way you keep me safe in a stand And you alone can't make me feel bad I never feel like this from a van But now I see the right thing clearly on the walls You want me at the right thing clearly overall Loving, running over like Niagara Falls You're my favorite boy You bring such joy to my world Tell me I'm your favorite girl You're my favorite boy But dance with me forever
