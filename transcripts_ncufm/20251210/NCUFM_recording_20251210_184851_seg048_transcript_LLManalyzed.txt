============================================================

We need peace in this time of turmoil. We need confidence and courage in this crisis. Understand that families are fractured. Finances are failing. Faith is also fading. We live in a time when many are alive but not living well. We live in time when many are functioning but not flourishing. We live in the time where folks are existing but not thriving. This evening I declare that God has a plan. He has a prescription for a healthy people. God has healing for the hurting. This evening, if your body is in pain and your strength you can't regain, you need someone.
