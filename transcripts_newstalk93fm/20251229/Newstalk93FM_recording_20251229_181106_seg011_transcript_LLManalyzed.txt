20251229 181106 I can't get over it So don't you ever let me down again Cause I'm depending on you So you better come through this time Please hear my cry And if I ever let you down my friend It was a misunderstanding. So why thought you'd get forgotten? You're not promised from today. I go drunk like I never drunk, waved like I never waved, whined like I never won before. Just to show you I'm sorry. I'm sorry. And I need you back in my life. Look at people by the truck. Emotions running high. We are not in the sky. Death running down we hide. Can't you tell that we're sorry? We're sorry. And we need you back in we hide. I need you back on the road.
