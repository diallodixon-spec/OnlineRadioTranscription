20251218 142823 side with my pumpkin over here. I have my sweet potato already and of course this is very important. Cheyenne, one of the things that I love about the Jamaica Forage Clubs is the fact that you do fantastic work with our young people but the truth is that the Jamaica Forage clubs you work with people of all ages. All ages. So we have community clubs, we have church clubs, we have college and we're in the schools. Excellent and there is a program that you do at the Jamaica 4-H clubs, the REAP program, which really, I think, has been hitting all of the right marks in agriculture. Why is that program as good as it is, you think? Again, we're dealing with the youth and you know the youth are the future, so we encourage all the youth that are across the island just to be come join 4-H and be a part you will benefit some way. How can one become a member of the Jamaica 4-H clubs? Well we have as I said earlier we have schools club we have community club church club so they can be a part of the club within that
