2025-12-12 13:36:25 When my sound play pictures lighters in the air Your vibes up in the street And that's just how it feels When reggae music plays Can't help but move your feet Pull I'm full of the vibe cause the music is sweet, yeah. Singing Shaggy, we be killing this beat, yeah. And watch the blessing flow like a river
