============================================================

It's always the hardest let it go Hardest let it go Especially if it's of the things we know Of the things we know Love's always better when it's shown Someone avoid it cause they're heartbreak prone Shouldn't be easier to find Shouldn't be easier, shouldn't be easier to sabotage Don't we all plan to tryize? Ending up with a heart that can't sacrifice Shouldn't it be easier to fight? Shouldn't it be easy to sacrifice? Don't we all planned to travelize?
