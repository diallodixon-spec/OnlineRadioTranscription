20251222 152114 How we love to ride is something we control They can't divide us, we'll survive the test of time, I promise I'll be right Standing next to you Standing in the fire next to you You know it's deeper than the rain It's deeper than the pain But it's deeper than DNA Tell me they can't take away Tick, tick to go standing next to you standing next to you oh standing next to you
