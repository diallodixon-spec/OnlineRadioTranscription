20251219 112622 the reason they gave you for that suggestion? That what they call it, a money market account cannot work for the pension. I think that was the pension office who said that. So I have another account there that is not very active. So NCB is saying to me, I have to open a new account. I live in the States, so I had to open the account online. For a long time, it wasn't even working. However, now it's working. I go online, I open the account. I got back a response that says, send in these documents or take them into an NCB branch. I sent my driver's license, my passport, a utility bill, my pay stub, PRN, and they have all been notarized. My brother just took them in a while ago.
