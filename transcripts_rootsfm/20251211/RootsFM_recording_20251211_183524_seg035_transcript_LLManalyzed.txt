2025-12-12 04:04:42 No, it's not fair for me to be sad, which road to take or what to hide. I am just a victim of love, but loneliness is all I am. Here I am, here I stand, crying for love. I knew I never had. I'm on my own, so all alone. If only you ever knew what I am going through. Because I love.
