20251226 172415 I got the one we could last long I don't even ever know my time Feel like what I waited for lifelong I pull up in my high fashion Every night I shit in any way We can go ahead and just head out And chill up in my villa, take it out the whole night Just get in the drop top, take the head out And cruise with your head outside head outside. Go ahead, it's your time, baby. It's your time baby, get my baby. That's the difference when you're my baby, that's how it is when you... Nobody make me stop the whirling.
