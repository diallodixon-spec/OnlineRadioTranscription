20251222 202824 I see them on the floor Flash Cartier when you open up the door Slide these on baby Soap butters still relate to the gutter Just your lifestyle's different, spirit uplifted Fell in love with a cat who's gifted Journey back to paradise, damn I missed it Pop a bottle light a purple candle I got something that you can't quite handle That's why you love me Poor bubbly, glow from the flame Make your skin shine lovely I'm singing baby, touch it why don't you? Touch it why don't ya? Hey girl, oh girl Hey girl, I wanna rock your world Paradise is very nice You want it, baby, just be real You're going home, take it to paradise I'm gonna give you all my love, yeah Next phase is this It's Black Santa, he be 10 days the reminisce God's my witness I paid the price for paradise
