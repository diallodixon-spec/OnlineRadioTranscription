in St. James has resulted in a reduction in murders and shootings. The parish has so far recorded 51 murders for 2025 compared to 119 over the corresponding period last year. The cops today seized another rifle in the parish. The P-15 rifle with a magazine containing 17 5.56 rounds as well as a bottle containing 37 5.56 rounds were seized. News comprehensive, powerful, powerful and credible. Power 106 FM has just presented a simulcast of Radio Jamaica's News at Five. I'll see you next time.
