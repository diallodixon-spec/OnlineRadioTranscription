20251224 095040 The Mustard Seeds community needs you in this season and beyond. Thank you so much. Thank you and you ladies keep up the good work, greatly appreciated. Thank you, thank you so much. Have a good good holiday and be blessed and get some rest because I know you're doing a lot of work so whilst you enjoy season, you get some rest too as you continue on into 2026. God bless you and the Mustard Seed community staff and directors. All right, Marcy, I just want to remind each and every one of you listening on, tuning in this morning, that of course we know that Arcane Melissa has impacted Jamaica in a way that has never been seen before. Catastrophe is an understatement to say the least.
