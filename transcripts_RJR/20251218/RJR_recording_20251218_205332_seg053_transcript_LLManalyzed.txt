And we have seen some real unfortunate situations because you find that firearm holders, they have storage at home. But whatever the reason is, through carelessness, as you mentioned, they do not store the weapons as is required, and so we'll find children accessing those weapons and I mean I don't want to really relive some of those instances but we have seen where there have been fatalities children access weapons and have actually preserved been injured in fact we have seen instances where children access those firearms and have taken them to school and have been seized there. But it could be worse, right? So firearm owners, they have to understand that they're in a privileged position, right?
