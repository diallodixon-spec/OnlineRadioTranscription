Right, so what we're saying is that in our proposal, we have the stop sign, we have issues such as suspended sentences, station bail, we have that the child will get their record expunged in a timely manner, but we do not believe that the stop sign, that legal consequence should be removed. We already are facing, as adults, we have the responsibility to raise our children and our society has, our children are exposed. So we have to, this is not the only solution. We take steps to have our children understand, educate them, interventions that this is not the correct thing to do. And we believe that the stop sign needs to remain in place. So yes, we're not saying that they spend a night in jail, not for first offense.
