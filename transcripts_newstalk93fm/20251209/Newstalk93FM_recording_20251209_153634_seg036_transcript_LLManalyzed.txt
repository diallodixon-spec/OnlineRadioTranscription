============================================================

I don't need a rich to somebody that can make me feel safe. Yeah. I don't want a couple, but nobody ever made me feel safe. Because when I'm with you, I just know I'm fine. You take all the pressure off my mind Patient in time will not be going out my mind Say from the problems I don't worry cause I'm hard to find Safe like I just ran a slit across the plate Safe like we playing tag in your home base Safe like I got a big dog in the gate Safe like you one of in my face Yeah, you know, I know you know that I'm that bitch, right? You got a girl that wanna get right When I pass and I crash, you ain't gon' dip, right? That's when I need you the most That's how I get right, right
