20251230 170305 affected families, even while many church buildings remain damaged and some unusable. Mr. Warmington questioned the justification for the allocation, arguing that many churches are financially stable. But Bishop Delford Davis of Power of Faith, Minister International, dismissing that claim, said churches are in fact struggling financially. I can't speak to that. I know churches struggle to carry out their missions because the mission of the church goes way beyond the four walls. For instance, yesterday we were in Westmoreland as one church and we were able to distribute lots of things through the generosity of our members and donors from overseas. We're able to take two truckloads of goods into Westmoreland along with other things. So the whole question of amassing wealth where churches are concerned, I don't understand that because we all have financial difficulties and challenges.
