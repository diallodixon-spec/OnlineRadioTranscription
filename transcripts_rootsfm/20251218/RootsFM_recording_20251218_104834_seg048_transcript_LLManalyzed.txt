20251218 104834 You know who? I don't know if there's anywhere else in the world or Dwight where you can go down a town and get your pedicure and manicure on the sidewalk and get it done well too and your eyebrow and your breathing on the sidewalk on the road. Oh, let me say excellent. Excellent craft, let me tell you. Oh, we that man. Very good, man. And it's so it's also good for some of the people who have their um their stores their abidashi their um the confectionery and all of the other stores but guess what the ones that do the nails and so forth the nail tech people are smart enough. They go nail the stores, they may sell the fake beauty for themselves. They just go in and just buy a shade color when the customer wants and they're ready. They work together. I see what's happening. They work together man. Yes, that's so awesome. Sweet, sweet vibes.
