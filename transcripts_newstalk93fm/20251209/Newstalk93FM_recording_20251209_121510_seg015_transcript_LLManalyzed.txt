Yeah, been a long time since you come my way you still hold a vibe every night and day Some I love crying in the time for the play Put it in drive so you'll manage it Baby when you see me, tell me that you need it Now we don't want no time to waste Yeah I'll go give you rise and wait But look how you love it, come back again Make me feel some type of way Send in a message straight to me friend Sing like diddy bamba diddy And anytime you come around I'll be the one to give you love You know I must come back, I want you to say Come, come wine, give me banga, banga, Banga, banga
