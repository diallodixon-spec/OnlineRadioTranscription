20251231 192321 We're almost to the end of this session, Dr. Daly. I wanted to just leave a takeaway with our listeners about diabetes managing this condition. It could be to the caregiver, it could be the patient who is having this condition, but you can just give us a takeaway today. Okay. Well, in terms of diabetes, for some person, I just want to correct something. In my part, where I am at Utech, or wherever I am going, persons believe that they will tell us that they have a touch of diabetes. I just want to correct that. You can't have a touch of a diabetes. You have to have it or you don't have it. Diabetes is a progressive disease, so it only gets worse if you don't control it.
