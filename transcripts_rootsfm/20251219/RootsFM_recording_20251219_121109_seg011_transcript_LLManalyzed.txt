So in my life, who shall I be afraid? They say when the wicked leave my enemy, I fall. They'll come unto me, see that my flesh shall stumble and fall in the mighty name of Jesus. Pray that my self of evildoers, be thou evildoer, turn to them, for the evildoers may soon cut off. Will not I peace a lot of thy praise? For the mouth of the wicked is open against me. They speak in a lying tongue with word of H's. Fight against us for our love when they shall judge, but I condemn they be few. Now I take their office in the mighty name of Jesus, touch all the water, touch the paper, the olive oil, shoot your blood. That's when they use it, God. Lord God, they use it by faith and success, healing, deliverance, clearance. Get energized, God. Touch every lens in their body. When they drink the water, shoot the blood. Grant them the common favor. In the mighty name of Jesus. Remember the needy. Remember the one that broken. Oh, God, touch them, broken, married.
