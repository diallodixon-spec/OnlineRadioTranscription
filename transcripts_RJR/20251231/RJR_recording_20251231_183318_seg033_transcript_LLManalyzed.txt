20251231 183318 I interviewed Marlon Douglas, Vice Mayor and Commissioner of the City of Tamarack, one of our Yadis abroad that we interviewed in 2025. One of the questions I have written down to here is higher heights, question mark, meaning all this political sabish surely can't be just staying at the local government level. You must be looking at whether a state senate or further. Yes. You know, I look at some politicians, not in my city, but cities down the street. And, you know, politicians are so pretentious. They are so for themselves. And really and truly, when I was elected, I said, you know what, I'm going to make a difference. I'm going to. Make sure that people are helped because of the political power that I have. And so, when I'm mayor, lots more people will be helped, right? And so, after mayor, the sky's the limit, or the sky's not the limit because I'm going to go beyond the sky, you know, because we're going to run for Florida.
