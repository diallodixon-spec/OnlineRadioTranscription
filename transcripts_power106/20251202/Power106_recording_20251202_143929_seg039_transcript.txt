I'm going to leave it there because I see Davin taking a number of calls and I have not taken one more since you came on. All right, we'll do. Who do we have next, Davin? 8 7 6 9 2 2 4 1 1 2 8 7 6, 9 2 2, 4 1 1 3, 8 7 6 9, 2 2, 4, 1 1 4. David, good afternoon. Sir, David. Good afternoon. How are you, sir? Good. Good to have you on with us as usual. To you and your team and to all listening on the platform, a wonderful day. Thank you, David. Just to tell you that you are well represented at the function. You would have been very pleased to hear the Glenmure choir. Oh, that's good.
