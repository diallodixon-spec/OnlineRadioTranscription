I think she has a pretty good chance pulling third behind Brahma Bull. That way should bring her on a bit to make her fitting apart. Big threats here in numbers two cut out. Who will be prominent for a long way, especially with Dawkins up. And we have Dee Storm also. Less fancied apprentice rider, Shane Martinup. We have She Is My Dream to be written by Christopher Mandean. Looks as though he's serious about race riding, more serious than winning the championship in 2019. Can he ride? Oh, yes he can. And he's writing She Is My Dream, to be the big threat to Miss Brightonon so these two riders will clash. Naked Flyer should be there or thereabouts with Townsend up and will come running on. Mr. D the starting gates on time though something that she doesn't do at times and then we have Family Feud
