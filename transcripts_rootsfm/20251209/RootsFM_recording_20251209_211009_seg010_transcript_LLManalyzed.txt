============================================================

to say, yet and still you've read my mind. And now we have a date I can hardly wait. All day long I thought of you. To have a real good time is my state of mind. This could be the sun of love. Tonight, make the town No more messin' around I wanna show the world this love I found And first I tried to play it cool To try and make you want me more But I got trapped by my own game You're the one that I adore Now we have a date I can't hide it
