20251231 171809 You dig a hole for me, dig one for yourself For God is my shield, is my defender This inch I'll surely find in house, sooner or later What goes around, comes around God is on my side, what goes around comes around I am covered by the blood of Christ, goes around, comes around God is on my side. What goes around, comes around. I will survive. Once or ever you saw, you will report. So be careful of the things you do and say.
