20251231 105131 I'm happy to see them. So I don't know, it's been a bad long time and then they go out and go dig up the road full of it, so they don't go give you water for the election and only fear nothing at 2027. We're not going to tolerate it. You cannot be a 30-minute drive. I thought 30, 30, 30, go and come, one hour. You take your time on a cruise. I take your five hours. Can't. Can't work. And I don't want to hear about burial. But, um, I started out because I said no cure repetitive me sound, me no care. Um, the, the year I done, one next year, one next year um, next, um, I come in and tax payers don't get them, them, get back their money. Are you anything about the U.K.R. deal from 2017? But as I said before, me did talk on the station here, so we now get it back. Taxpayers now get it back, okay?
