20251230 120606 President of the National Parent Teacher Association of Jamaica, Stuart Jacobs. He was speaking today on the morning agenda on Power 106. In the past, some schools have been shuttered and attendance taken a nosedive due to crime and violence. Up to December 20, the country had officially recorded 649 murders, a historic drop when compared with 1,136 for the same period in 2024. And the Jamaica Association of Principals of Secondary Schools is also calling for the government to increase investment in education as a way to sustain the recent reduction in crime and violence. President of the Association, Livin Wright, warns that without stronger efforts to make children more socially adaptable, the state will be forced to continue pouring resources into security. What we have got to be careful of is to think that one precedes the other and they don't go hand in hand.
