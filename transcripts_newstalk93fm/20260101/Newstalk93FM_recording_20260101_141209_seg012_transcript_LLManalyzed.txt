20260101 141209 Hurry please, home is where the heart should be Pretty feathers in disguise Not together we will rise So don't you ever Let me down again Cause I'm depending on you So you better come through this time Please hear my cry and if I ever Let you down my friend It was a misunderstanding So if I took you for granted You're not promised from today I go drunk like I never drunk Waved like I never waved Pined like I never won before Just to show you I saw you, I saw you And I need you back in my life You got people by the truck Emotions running high We underpin the sky Tears running down we eye And you tell them we sorry, we sorry And we need you back in we lie And if I come back home
