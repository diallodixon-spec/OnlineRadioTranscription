20251230 141208 I need your love, I need your love I need your l-l-l-ala Let me love you, oh, oh, oh If I love you, love me right now The kind of love that keeps you coming back If I love you love me right now Don't ever leave me alone, don't do me that So please, don't walk away Give me another chance to love you the right way. I don't care if it's pushin' on you. All my beloved, you can't do it all. Who am I without you by my side? Every little piece of my heart broken in the dark, wishin' I could hold you now. When you were here for me, I was lost.
