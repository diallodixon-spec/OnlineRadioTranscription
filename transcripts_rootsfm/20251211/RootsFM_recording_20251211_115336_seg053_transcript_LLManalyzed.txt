And when I look on the system, I see whereby you were charged for disorderly conduct on a particular day, date, and time. And when I realize, it is showing on your thing, but you can show me a document from the justice system to say that that was not so. You understand, that is not so. I wasn't convicted of this. I was acquitted of this situation. And sometimes most of the time there, the judge give you a letter. So those letters are important to us. Sign and stamp. Sometimes if you're if you're doing report at the station, they ask you to take it back to the station station My suggestion to you is just ask the police to copy it and give you about the original Because this document is going to help you one day When you need a police record and the record is showing me on the system that you're charged, but nothing now go south
