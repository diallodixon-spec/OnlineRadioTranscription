20251226 113628 We're not daft and we're not lazy Been helping mama out ever since I was a baby For real Nothing ever gravy Life's been at the gate so put your shelter over safety Everywhere you walk a bad news If I don't leave then I will never get a grand view The law is this cause nobody no follow no rules But to get to teach your life gets it confused Realize that I wanna grow wanna grow wanna grow out there I'm gonna show gonna show that I have no fear Long stood the most time you live to see another year Off to get my share So easy make me got you Ever trying Work so hard and yet me still behind man Easy make me gotcha. Ever trying. Work so hard and yet we still behind man. Easy make me got ya. Can't give up. From 1990 long been on the grind man. Tired of me all the time. That's what ya. The time it feels so hungry I'll be crying man, easy make me gotcha, easy.
