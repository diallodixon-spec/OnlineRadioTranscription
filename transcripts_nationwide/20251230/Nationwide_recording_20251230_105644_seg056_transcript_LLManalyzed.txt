My uncle sent one by line when my family got for credit. You don't want to hear the price the people then put on the something. But matters worse, me hear half of the things they're missing and I don't sell customs. Girl, how you don't sell customs? You should stop going like you don't have any sense. You don't see everybody talk about it in the media? You don't want me to stop listening to you say? You ever experience that? Customs don't go in your package, suitcase, barrel or cargo unless you ship the item or the agent stand up right there when they inspect it. Listen, customs job is to protect the borders, collect revenue and facilitate trade. They don't collect or store shipment, they inspect it and somebody has to present it.
