20251226 154628 I ain't good enough, but the Lord still loves me. No, no, no, no. Please raise your hands if you understand how he blessed you, because he blessed me too. Even though I ain't worthy, you ain't worthy. He's there for you. This is your opportunity to usher in the Sabbath hours with us. So join me, Lyseth Martin. And me, Lincoln Lyking, every Friday evening at 5.05pm. It's Sunset Serenade, right here on NCUFM.
