20251224 163632 Let my words be, before life journey Let me lay you down And if life journey, should break us girlie Shoot away or frown Like take some places, I miss your face I need the changes, with you I'm sick I know my brain is out for granted days I will keep on loving you, love you a lot to say Oh I'll find a way, to let my words speak
