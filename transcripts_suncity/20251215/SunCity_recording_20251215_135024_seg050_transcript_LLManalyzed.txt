But she dress like salt in a walk, it's mean. Only thing wrong with mine, she's always on the scene. She's fine, but she parties all the time. I get frequent fire mileage from my stewardess chick.

She gives me extra pillows pillows and seat back love So I had to introduce her to the now hot club Young chicks do what is project and model That means I fly rough early plus I know tabo That means I'm new school, pop pills and stayin' weak But I never have a problem with my first class seat, I love Girls, girls, girls, girls Girls, I do Yo, put your number on this paper, because I would love to meet you. Holler at you when I come on tour. Wig, wig, wig, wig.
