20251215 132011 I see kids and play I see children play in the streets Same streets where the AKs blaze Every day of the week them afraid of police Face full of bleach on the legs and the hands too Can't see it when I knuckle them dark I wonder what these politicians feel When they see them coulda just laugh Rise their new revolution women When kids get execution killin' On the news I say man a rape baby But that na face a place where everybody's still chillin' Let me change the channel, site what a go on in Israel and Palestine In a Syria, all Nigeria, fuck all Ram like them lost their mind And me no like to talk all the negative, but that's all when me see it on the television Unless a boxing match or a finals, distract the mind with subliminal messages
