20251215 150505 My mother is the daughter of one of those children named in the will. Is it that your mother is interested in a particular piece? Yes, she has a piece willed to her by name. And that's the portion you're interested in? For her, yes. Just her part. Perfect. Is she in control of that part? When you say in control, no. Is she occupying it? No, no. She left the island years ago and went to the UK. So she never occupied it. So who controls her it, like other family members have control of it. Are they controlling it with her permission?
