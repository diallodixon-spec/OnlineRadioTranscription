20260101 091106 I don't care what the enemy is trying to tell you. I don't know what he's trying to show you. I need somebody who determines God. I believe it's going to happen for me. I don't care how long it's going to take. It's going to happen. I came to encourage you tonight. Hold on to God's promises. Every word that he said. It's going to come to pass. It's gonna come to pass. Somebody encourage yourself. Say, it's you. It's you. Come to pass.
