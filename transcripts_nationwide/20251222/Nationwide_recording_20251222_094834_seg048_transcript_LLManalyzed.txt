20251222 094834 We have some questions in the YouTube chat that we are gonna get to as well. I'm not sure if this person joined after but I think the question is the same but I'm still gonna ask. This person says my dad filed for my brother in 2017. How much longer does he have to wait? And that the father is a citizen. Okay. But I wonder if the brother is married or single, but if the brother is marriage, they're now at November 8th, 2006. If the brother is single, they're at November 8th 2016. If the brother is married, they're at September 2011. All right. All right. Here is another one. This person is asking about that visa integrity fee that we haven't really heard much more about, but I'll ask the question just the same.
