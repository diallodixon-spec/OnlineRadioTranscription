National Relief Concert to Support Hurricane Melissa Victims

A powerful National Relief Concert is set to take place this Sunday at 5 p.m. on the east lawn of King's House, under the patronage of the Governor General. The event, organized by Shabbat Jamaica, aims to support those affected by Hurricane Melissa and promote long-term relief efforts. Rabbi Yaakov Raskin, Director of Shabbat Jamaica, spoke about the concert, stating, "We're coming together, supporting a good cause... We want to help people, social workers, and we're doing this through the power of music."

The concert will feature performances by award-platinum singer Alex Clare, Young Ross, and Chris Malachi, among others. Rabbi Raskin emphasized the importance of the event, saying, "We're not going to tower down. We're going to make it a great concert... Jamaica, we shall rise." Tickets are available online at lightjamaica.com, with proceeds going towards hurricane relief and community rebuilding.

Shabbat Jamaica has been actively involved in relief efforts since the hurricane, providing food, water, tarps, and medical supplies to those in need. The organization has also brought in a medical plane and two 40-foot containers of aid, with plans to continue providing support in the long term. Rabbi Raskin stressed the importance of community and unity, saying, "One love, one light... That's the name of the concert... Get your tickets now at lightjamaica.com, always light, always love."

The National Relief Concert promises to be an inspiring and uplifting event, promoting hope and resilience in the face of adversity. As Rabbi Raskin said, "Alone, you can do so much, but together, we can do a lot more." The concert is a testament to the power of community and the human spirit, and all proceeds will go towards supporting those affected by Hurricane Melissa.
