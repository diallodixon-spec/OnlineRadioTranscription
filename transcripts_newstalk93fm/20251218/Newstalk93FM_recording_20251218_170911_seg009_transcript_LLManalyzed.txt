20251218 170911 I never lose myself inside this place when I show my shit up Empty soca and glass when the bitch across the madness, what's up? Just give me one more shot inside my glass and watch me level up Fitting like a hero, all the heroes As I raise my hand, I leave the bad vibes on zero. I'll leave the good luck on zero. Oh, oh, oh, oh. Acting like a hero. Whoa, yo-yo, yo-yo. Whoa-yo-yo-yo. Call me a hero as soon as I reach the top.
