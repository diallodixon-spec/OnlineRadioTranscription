All right? Folk, I can tell you this. Hello? All right. Mark will call back tomorrow. I've said this to my students all the time. Don't expect anybody to invade Jamaica because we have anything. We don't have no resources. The last time I heard them down by Fonthill in St. Elizabeth said that they think they'll find a little oil. I don't, I don't expect anything to be, I mean, if it happens one day, I'd appreciate it. But yeah, what we have is enormous resources.
