20251218 092016 the, you know, festivity and all of that. And for me, this time of the year is primarily for our young ones, our children, you know, looking at their little faces and so on, seeing that innocence in their eyes and so on and so forth, and just really and truly enjoying themselves. I have some nieces and some grand nieces and so on who really and truly they're basking at this time as they, you know, appreciate the goodies that they aunt Vanet and aunt Donna, Dawn, you know, would have ensure that they have and other extended members of my family would ensure that they have. And also, I'm sure that that is what is taking place in other families, you know. I can just imagine, um, Kyle, or Kyle, I'm trying to remember.
