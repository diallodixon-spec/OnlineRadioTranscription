20251224 152011 victory for you and for me one day a anger crowd they crucified this king who wore the crown and they gladly watched my champion going down but I will never count enough out for having written a song The day he rose to attain the title champion of love And you find him the hardest Said he's greater than the great No one could ever take his crown away For he's more mighty than the mightiest He reigns from above
