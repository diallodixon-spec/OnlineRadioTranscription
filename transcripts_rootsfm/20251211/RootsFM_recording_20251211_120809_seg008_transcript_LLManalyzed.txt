bless them who feed the street people, the church people who ask for strength and deliverance, who pray at every railway station, provide for them, grant them favours and bless and consecrate our guide and grant our favours in Jesus name. Touch the prime minister, the opposition leaders, the truck driver, the security guards, them cover them on their blood. I pray for strength to take the children. Oh god, teachers, cover them, mother, father, sister, and brother. Oh god, provide for them. Oh god, they say although I'm late and I'm on my journey. Journey man Jesus. Journey along with somebody today. Touch of the outreach program. Provide for it. Cover it on their wings and their blood. Mighty god of Daniel. Touch and consecrate. Uproot, chop down, tear down.
