In all, we have about 80, 81% of the money to deal with the total damage. Now, one point we need to be making clearly is that before we even get to that, we have to recognize that this is a loan. Yes. And we have to recognize, that we're borrowing this money. Yeah, they're not free gifts. Yep, right. To go back to where we are coming from, not to go forward, to go back to where are coming from from to deal with the damage. We have to also bear in mind that the damage, part of the damage can be attributed to bad policy. Yeah. So you weren't investing in your infrastructure. So you are weak. So the hurricane came and it damaged the infrastructure significantly. The majority of the damage that we sustained was infrastructural damage. Yeah. Poverty. Yeah. So that's a lesson that you need to learn. Next thing that we're saying now, we need a proper system of accountability to deal with this kind of flows because this is a whole lot of money in terms of the capacity of the economy in terms of what we have ever borrowed before.
