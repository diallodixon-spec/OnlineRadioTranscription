Everything is changed. Everything is changed. For me. I believe it today. Come on, say that again. I believe. Lift your voice and say. I believe. I believe. His word. And I receive. I receive. His word. His word. He promised me a change. He promised me. He gave me a change. And because he's gone, I believe it. I proclaim. I will. I will, I will. I'm standing on his word. Standing on his word. He promised to me a change. He promised me a change. And by faith I received it.
