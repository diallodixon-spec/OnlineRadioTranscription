20260101 174223 In the name of love See I know there's somebody breaking out of a sharp pain somewhere And you can be sure that somebody's gonna make love. And I'll hide until the day. Oh, one thing. One thing's for sure. I'm gonna put on my dancing shoes. And I'll shut the door. And go out and snap the whole night through. Clap in the name of love.
