Good evening and welcome to this, the Night Gap for Wednesday, the third day in the brand new month of December. And so for those having a birthday today, we say happy birthday to you. Hope it's been great so far and hope you're enjoying every moment of it for those heading home right now traffic or no traffic if by chance you're in the Kingston region and you're experiencing traffic what else can you do but gotta wait and take your time and get past it if you're heading east or or west, if you're heading north or south, safe travel as you do so, for those heading on to work. If you're not late, well, tell you what, take your time, and get there safely. If you're late, no rushing. If you're done late already, just take your time.
