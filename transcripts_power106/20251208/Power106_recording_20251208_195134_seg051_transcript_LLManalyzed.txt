Grand Prix. The 26-year-old Briton edged Red Bull's Max Verstappen by just two points in the final standings. Verstappen won the race, his eighth victory of the season, but it wasn't enough to overhaul Norris, who was backed by a superb drive from McLaren teammate Oscar Piastri, the runner-up. McLaren controlled the title decider from early, with Piastri always close enough to offer support if Norris came under pressure. The championship caps a remarkable seventh season for Norris, who started the year slowly but surged into the second or surged in the second half to claim Britain's 11th Formula One World title. It also delivers McLaren's first drivers and and Constructors Championship double in the modern era. And that's it for your sports headlines inside of Powerplay, I'm Jesse Blake.
