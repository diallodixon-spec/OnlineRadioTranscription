20251226 181111 The call of God is the most important call of your life. Every one of us will hear from Him. He may be calling you today even as you are listening to this broadcast. He wants to talk to you about your life and about your future. There can be nothing in this world more important than to realize what the sovereign Lord of this universe is saying to us. God always wants to get our attention and His call will come in that moment in time when He gets it. He sends your message that is personal and specific and it requires a conscious decision or action on your part. No matter who you are, you can know that there is a call that He issues to every single one of us. It is His call to you to be saved. In Matthew chapter 11 verse
