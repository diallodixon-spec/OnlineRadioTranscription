Your mother never with it, so it mash up her nerve. What you say, you're not going to leave it, because you have a concern. But the youth, the way you boost it, and somehow, they're not alert. You rough up everybody, no respect, you're not heard. Extreme tolerance, so for that, we are alert. The people from the gun inside the cars are stripping lanes and it's a burn. Would a love to see the day when every gun burn. Police get back a button and the poor pocket fattened. Then you wouldn't have to worry about crime call. They just had them breathe the dollar sign. So make up on your mind cause we looking around.
