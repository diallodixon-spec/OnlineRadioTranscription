20251224 200609 You don't have to be afraid Remember the words I say Wednesday I'll be coming home to you We don't have to fight baby baby. Come and take our life with pain. I swear to the sun, replace it more. Don't send us a sponge, it's a fine day. I out on the road, I'll line it. Tell them that it's over, hand me. Hey, hey, you won't see me Wednesday. Don't send a such sponge, it's fine day. I lost on the road, all right, hey. Tell them that is over, hand me, hey, hey. You won't see me, Wednesday. Hey, hey. I'm not coming home tonight. I'm not going home tonight.
