20251226 114334 I have a lightning spirit Early in the morning I hat it Me cooler ready Me heist done ready Me punching that's automatic I have a lightning jby, a kind of energy inside me And it ready for the rum, ready, ready for the rum Ready, ready, for the rum Ready for the action, a spiritual encounter Killing me soul taking over, telling me to start up the drinking Can't do away with good behaviour, so we out on the road now BOOM! It's Mars and Riddy Man Soaker And I'm ready for the rum Ready, ready for the rum, ready, ready for rum Ready for the action, boom! This vetting spirit of the feeling
