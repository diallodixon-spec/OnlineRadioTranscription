Everything advanced, nothing that I do is basic. Me and Rose Royce on a first name basis. Look her with no chases. Only give her hunnits cause she hates seeing new faces. Know she want her mind by the stones in her bracelet. Little money, be a hot and down station. She told me to pay for it, now she backing it up. Used to date a Bob player, but they wrapping it up. Got her in a penthouse and I'm smacking it up. They gon' point you to the top if you asking for us. Come on. Go, go ahead, it's your time baby. It's your time.
