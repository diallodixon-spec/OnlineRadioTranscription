20251226 112109 I'm gonna pack my chairs away Got no cause to look back Cause I'll be looking for a better day You said a thing I don't love I said it's not enough And it's the only thing gonna bring you to Spain, darling Comes a time when we could all make a change, darling So let go Let it flow, let it flow Let it flow
