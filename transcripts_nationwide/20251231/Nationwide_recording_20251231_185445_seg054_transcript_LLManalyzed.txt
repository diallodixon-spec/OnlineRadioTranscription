20251231 185445 years I've gotten frustrated but I've been saying to them report because if we were going to follow the data and if we look at the data we don't see a lot of instances of greater loss there are lots of reports and we might not deploy the wardens there where they might be needed so it's very important but just to say Siobhan and Tyrone you know this is a focus for a couple of years and we are seeing we good returns. In fact, between 2023 and 2024, we did see good increases in some of the key indicators. So for example, in 2023, we would have, the JCF would have arrested 79 people for gradient larceny. Last year it was 130, 131 that they arrested. Cars that they seized in 2023 seized 8 cars in the Act of Credit. Last year 28 cars were seized. So we are seeing steps in the right direction. And there's one more area.
