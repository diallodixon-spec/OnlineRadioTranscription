20251215 202722 No man can decide my destiny Only I can decide my own for me Why? Cause I'm a whole dandelion I wanna be free from all chains and all banners and ropes Free from all bars and all borders and docks Free to price the land because I'm in a price depot Some I know you wash your face in Babylonian soap Me a bully by fate and he me a bully by oath Life rough and hard but with it me a free coat Some take it on the level and some fly down the slope Silent river run deep but Gangali have to float I was born to be free. And who have eyes, they will see.
