20251229 162718 This country is too loose man. No rules and regulations. When you have dogs, you can't feed the dog. You let your dog all over the place and become a nuisance to other people. And you don't have any redress. This country is too loose, man. You have animals, you have cows, you have goats, you have all kinds of things. You let them all over the place. You plant everything in the yard, the goats. People let them go, they just come to your yard, come your things and all. It used to be a big problem in Portmore where I live in One North. Goat just come from across the road over Brayton for example and just eat your plants. And just eat your plants! And if you try and do anything with a man goat if you don't mind chopping him.
