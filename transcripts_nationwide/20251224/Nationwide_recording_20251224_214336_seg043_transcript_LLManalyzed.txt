So sometimes when I'm hitting a wall, yes, I might go on my knees and pray, but the truth is what I do is I look for the aspects of God in that thing. So I said, okay, is there love here? Is there faith here? Is there kindness here? Is there patience here? So you can actually, when you when he's seeking God is really finding God in all of the things yes you know so even sometimes you know in my industry or in our industry then there might be situations you might people might judge you and say oh like why are you doing this why you go on this show why you on this show whatever and I said well you know you talk about relationships you talk about love you talk about people about people. I love people. So it's really me bringing love into the space. It's not about chanting down or judging someone else's things. So it's like seeking first the kingdom, oh my god, don't always just look like you're looking for the church, but you being the church where you're going. That's a little free scripture for you guys.
