But God always forgives, because there is a difference between excuse and forgiveness. There is a big difference. Do you remember Peter who denied Jesus three times? When Peter and the risen Lord met, what did Jesus ask Peter? Did the Lord ask Peter, was it right for you to deny me? Why did you leave me alone? Did the Lord say to Peter? I understand. Did the Lord tell Peter? I knew you were just a weak man. No. An excuse is an escape route.
