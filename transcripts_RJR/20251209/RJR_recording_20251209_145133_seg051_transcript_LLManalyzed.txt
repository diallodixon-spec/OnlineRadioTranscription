who want to start a business in terms of food or wellness, you know, like you're on your path, you know, doing what you do. What advice would you give somebody that they're saying, no, I should try, you know, putting more functional foods out there in the market? Agreed. And functional foods will have a short shelf life. And so this is why, you know, big commerce is not running commercial functional food down because we have like a shelf life of two, three to six months, whereas some people want a shelf life of 2 years. But my advice to anybody starting a business, go ahead and do it. It needs to be done. We need to bring back real food into the market. And, you know, this real food needs to be accepted by young and old. So I would say go ahead and do it. Try it first with everybody at home and then broaden your audience and see if it's accepted by your audience.
