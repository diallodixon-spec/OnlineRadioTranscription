20251230 193518 And you were suffering pain But I didn't dare just turn my head And love the other way For when your heart is aching My heart is aching too Let me help you bear your burden That's the least that I can do I'll be standing in the gap for you Just remember someone somewhere Is praying for you Calling out your name Praying for your strength I'll be standing in the ground for you Right now you may be troubled with everything
