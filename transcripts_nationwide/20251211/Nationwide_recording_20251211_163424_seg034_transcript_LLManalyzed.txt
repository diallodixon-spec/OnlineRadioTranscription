2025-12-11 16:43:13 Standing here looking out my window Nights are long and my days are cold Cause I don't have you How can I be so damn demanding? I know you said that it's over now but I can't let go Everyday I wanna pick up the phone Until I get back your everything I need no more Only I can find you Like a ghost on the left hand There's no coming back to me Like a wedding without a groom I'm missing you, baby Through the desert without the sun A woman without a man
