20260101 134520 two blue, number six is at five to one. Small field of five runners. It's between one of the two favorites, between thousand treasures and midnight blue number five. One of them should win. Let's see what happens. Let's take it over now for race three. Six and a half furlongs. Starter appears to be ready. There off! Papi Uso breaks quickly, so too Cher de Jour and Thousand Treasures. Midnight runner races in behind, narrowly overtaken by Chou Blue. As they make their way down the back stretch, they've left a six and run toward the five. Cher de Jour setting the fractions under Garvin Harris, they lead up by just over a length, True Blue now slicing into that lead. Thousand Treasures sitting just in behind them, right against the rail that's Pappy Oussot and the champion jockey Radish Roman and Midnight Runner cruising at the back as they charge away inside the last.
