I'm so pretty, can't you understand? A guy like you, Mickey! Oh, what you do, Mickey, do, Mickey! Don't break my heart, Mickey! Hey, Mickey! Now, will you take me by now? Who the hell am I gonna know? Every time you move, I'll never see them all show. There's something new in you, so don't say no, Mickey! So come on and give it to me any way you can. Any way you want to do it, I'll take it like a man. But please, baby, please don't leave me in this damn, Mickey. Oh, Mickey, what a pity you don't understand. You take me by the heart when you take me by the hand. Oh, Mickey you're so pretty, can't you understand? It's got to be you, Mickey. Oh, what you do, Mickey, do, Mickey, don't break my heart, Mickey.
