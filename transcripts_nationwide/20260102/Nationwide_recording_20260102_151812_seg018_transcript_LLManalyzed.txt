20260102 151812 We are so grateful and so happy just from the depths of our soul, you know, yeah. So Kareem, are we on Facebook or what? Because I energy with us. We've got a great show for you today and I was almost going to sing the Monday song but it is not Monday, it is Friday, it's a festive Friday. DJ Drum is in the building, you don't know what's going on. Because now I'm going to do a full down test. Don't test like a fool, don't test. Itch, scratch, pitch, patch. And all the things we're going to have on the show. Also just want to say happy birthday to our boss. Boss, favorite boss Dan Viva.
