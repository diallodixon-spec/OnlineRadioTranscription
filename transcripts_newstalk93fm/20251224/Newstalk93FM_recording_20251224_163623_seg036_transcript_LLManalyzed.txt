20251224 163623 We don't want no batter that I need a little breather Two days on the road with some jam in the middle Dicey come we need to find the middle For the sake of peace of mind So the middle of the road is we deserve it. Set all your friends and them. Set all the girls and them. Bring all your friends and then. And let's get it started. I say, I say, boy, yo, yo, yo. Oh, so come on, say, make a joke. But let we start it by the joke, by the joke. Let we start it by each other. Party on the road. There's a party on the road. Light it up, light it up. Bring your shots and light it up. Party on the roads.
