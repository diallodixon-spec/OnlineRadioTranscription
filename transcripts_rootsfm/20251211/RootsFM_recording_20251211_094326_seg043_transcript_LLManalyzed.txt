I don't have time for those three bungles and money on my mind and I figured it And I said real bad girl no friend for me to walk in the wine of the world, I blessed her Remember the days she can't afford the bus pass Now I pass when you pass the bus in a S-Class Get a dream, more cream, more skin More cream mean money for the whole scheme Christiana, my place know what I mean Brown girl from the ghetto Hey, hey,'t have time for those three bungles. In Europe, we're mine, and we have to get different, too. Hey, we're not have time for the three bungles. Money, power, we're mine. And we have to get it. Hey, life is such a movie. Make me step up into the scene. I thought it was a little picnic. It's nothing, but it's a dream. I want to wake up in the morning, face in the cleaner. Run, go check my momma. I want to beat in her ass.
