============================================================

There's no stopping you and me As I'm not a game, I'm here to stay All the love is stronger than any drug I dig you just can't get enough And And every time I want you, I want some more. Just close the door and let's explore each other. Long as I know you got me. I'll be the way you love tonight. I'll be love you love tonight.
