20251212 124729 How we in a world flexin' yo But me like say you happin' best in the truth Hotel, suite, sky view No guessin' what me happin' do to you Apply pressure till rain Hope and praise, you know, cold like Maine A toothbrush to the brain And know me can't take it out for a stain So me know say you will feel it Is this a dream? Am I awake? Moon on your skin Hands round your waist Music is love And I hear tuna play The way how you're moving Got me feeling awake, awake, awake
