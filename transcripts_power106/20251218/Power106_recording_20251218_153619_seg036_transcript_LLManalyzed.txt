20251218 153619 I think in that regard, Jamaica has been in line with international standards for identification and for verifying that you are who you say you are in terms of birth certificate and passports, and then you going to an embassy to obtain a visa. Not to say that fraud does not still exist because you will always have fraud. There's even fraud in U.S. passport issuance. So I think that Jamaica is ahead in that regard because many years ago, 15, 20 years ago, we moved from the paper, birth certificates and those older passports to the digitized version. So it's much harder to tamper with and much more secure and valued in the international sense.
