20251226 093731 Look at people in the street Chippin' down a lane It's how we break with the chain Come and taste our freedom, sweetie When you want your ways Look how you have it in places Hot and groovy Look what music could do it It's half way in a jam again Feel like a movie When you throw it back on me I feel feel no stress again Every day, tonight, I won't let it go Feeling really, really good Thank you for the love, baby I didn't know before then Looking back and on and on Welcome to Jacksonville
