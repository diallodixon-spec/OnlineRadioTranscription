20251224 102513 You give me hope, hope. You're like a sunrise. No, I'm not afraid. Cause you give me hope when I walk on sinking sand. Feeling lonely in a crowd. When everything's pulling me in every direction. You're my anchor. You're my solid ground. All I'm searching for are five. You're medicine for my mind. You give me hope, hope. You're like the morning sun, and I'm not alone. I'm not alone, you give me hope. Hope, you're like the sunrise.
