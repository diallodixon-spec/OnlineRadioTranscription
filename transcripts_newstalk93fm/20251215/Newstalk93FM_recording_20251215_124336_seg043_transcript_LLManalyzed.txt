20251215 124336 We are now at the end of our drive. I'm cute but with errors babe, I'm just shooting my shot If I could get in, drive me a pen Hop in the **** and come over Don't wanna be friends, just in the skin I wanna get closer and closer and closer The way you got me all in my head I think I'm better than you in my bed Whatever it is, you know I can take it Counting the days, how many days till I can see you again Oh, my darling Holding my feelings baby, you got me on
