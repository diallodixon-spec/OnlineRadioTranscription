20251215 213019 I'm in love with the shape of you We push and pull like a magnet do Although my heart is falling too I'm in Love with your body Last night you were in my room And now my bedsheets smell like you Every day discovering something brand new I'm In love with your body Every day discovering something brand new We're going out on our first date You and me are thrifty so go all you can eat Fill up your bag and I fill up the plate We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour And how your family's doing okay And even getting in a taxi Kissing the backseat Tell the driver make the radio play And I'm singing like Girl you know I want your love Your love was handed to me
