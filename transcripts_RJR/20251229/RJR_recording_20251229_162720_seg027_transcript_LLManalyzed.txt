20251229 162720 Good afternoon to Ken Roy. His word is generous. It's a great word. Another one coming in here saying grateful is the word. Gratitude from Sophie in Kingston as well. And who else is here with us? Andrea from Portmore. Grateful is also her word. Jacqueline from Clarendon says greatness, good and guidance have to trip it up on us. Hey JT in Meadowbrook
