And of course, if you don't know your Two Life Crew, we've got your family. This one says, hey, Deli Cristina. Much better. I said, big up for the Deli. Hey, good afternoon, Two Life Crew. Extended belated birthday to my friend, cousin Iceland Green, is it Whitfield? I'm seeing Whitfield here. Should that be Whitfield? It may be. A.K.A. Cherry, area leader in Quick Step St. Elizabeth. Birthday greetings coming from Aunt Val in Canada. Celebrate your day today. Greetings coming from Corinne Watson-Smith, AKA Karen. Happy birthday to Leith again.
