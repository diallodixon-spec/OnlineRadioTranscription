20251226 172511 I can tell you got big big energy. It ain't too many of them that can handle me. But I might let you try it out the Hennessy. Make them sing to this thing like a melody. And if your girl ain't right, I got a remedy. It ain't to many of them they can handle me. Bad chick, I could be a fantasy. Tell me how you want it. Three, two, one, and I'm on it. Feel good, don't it? Hood chick, you ain't a bunny. I'ma bust it on the pole like unnies. Don't you be an unnies. Juicy, mini-maid, but can't do a one mini-maid. Not a side or a main. I'm the only one he entertains. Spinning his mind in the bank. I like what I see. A boss like you need a boss like me. Get it from the streets or he move low-key-key Tryna rock that mic like karaoke On the count of three, bad, big money Broke, didn't look what I wanted I'm the one they love to hate, but they can't get past Pretty face, no waist in a big ol' bag Bad chick, that could be a fantasy I could tell you got big money
