============================================================

The Big Bad Bloodstone from way back. What a big time classic. Got my friends singing along as they make the trek across town right now, safe travel. For those on the job, we say top of the evening. Closing out the first half of the program, we'll pick up the other half just after the news roundup on top of the hour at 10. I want to thank you.
