20251231 151208 We're exactly in Jamaica when you find Shantytown. Good afternoon to Mr. and Mrs. Rose. The anniversary celebration was yesterday and I'm going to call a link to find out how was it yesterday for Mr. and Mrs. Rose. Keep it locked right, junior station roots. The unstoppable radio station. It is Wednesday afternoon. Live radio, it's not ringing. Uh oh, I don't know what's up. Something is not right. I gotta get the number correct anyway to make this particular link.
