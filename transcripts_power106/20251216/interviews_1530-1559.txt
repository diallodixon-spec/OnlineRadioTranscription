**Interview with Vanna Taylor, Chairman for Villas and Apartments with the Jamaica Hotel and Tourist Association**

In a recent interview on Power 106 FM, Vanna Taylor, the Chairman for Villas and Apartments with the Jamaica Hotel and Tourist Association, discussed the current state of the tourism industry in Jamaica, particularly in the aftermath of Hurricane Melissa. Taylor, who is also the area chairman for Ocho Rios and Runaway Bay, expressed gratitude that the lives of her community members were spared, despite the damage caused by the hurricane.

When asked about the damage to areas under her administration, Taylor reported that while there was damage, it was not as severe as in other parishes. She attributed this to the efforts of the Jamaica Public Service (JPS) team, whom she publicly thanked for their hard work in restoring electricity and facilitating the cleanup process.

Taylor emphasized that the winter tourist season is in full swing, and Jamaica is ready to welcome visitors. She highlighted that hotels, attractions, and tours are open, and cruise shipping has resumed in Ocho Rios. Taylor invited listeners to come and experience the warmth and hospitality of Jamaica, assuring them that everything is in place for a wonderful vacation.

The conversation also touched on the restorative works done in preparation for the tourist season. Taylor mentioned that meetings have taken place at the highest level with the minister and the government to address concerns, particularly regarding the supply of agricultural produce. She expressed appreciation for the support of hotel team members, who are the "lifeblood" of the industry.

In a heartfelt message, Taylor welcomed visitors to Jamaica, saying, "Please come back to Jamaica, land that we love, and of course, to our family and friends, we say please come. Our visitors, whether it's your first time or repeat visitors, please come. Jamaica is ready, and we are looking forward to your arrival. Our airports are ready, everything is ready, and when you come, you will have a fabulous time, and you will enjoy our people, our warmth."

This interview highlights the resilience and determination of the Jamaican tourism industry in the face of adversity, as well as the country's readiness to welcome visitors and provide a memorable experience.
