What I am looking at on the scale of the devastation is not even a matter that contractors need to participate for themselves. It's a matter of this whole country has to be mobilized. We have to mobilize all resources, all hands on deck to deal with this. I don't see how any single arm or single group can deal with it. What we see needs us as a people to mobilize physically and obviously psychologically to really take this on. Contractors, we are not just businesses, we are citizens of the country. We live here and like myself, many of us hope to be buried here. And the country is not just a bank account to me, it's the place where our families and our children live and we have a duty, a duty to the country to do our best in this time of crisis.
