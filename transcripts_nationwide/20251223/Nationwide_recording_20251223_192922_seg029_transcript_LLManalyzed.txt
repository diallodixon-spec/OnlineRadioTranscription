However, I prefer the original red sorrel that we had at continent december time. it used to sell in the carnation market in bundles yes people never used to poke it off and um say it like what they are talking about this story that we are having now the quality of it you know it cannot stay as long as the original story and the taste i believe it's a bit different from the original story yes it's a part that is true in some of the farming practices that allows it to be available throughout the year so
