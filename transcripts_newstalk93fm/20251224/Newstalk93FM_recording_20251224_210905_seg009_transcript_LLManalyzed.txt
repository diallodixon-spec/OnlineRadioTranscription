20251224 210905 to the good times. I'll be gone by the sunrise. I'll be better on my own. I'll be on my own. Nah, nah. Nobody should call my phone, nobody should call my phone. Nah, this is my last heartbreak song. This is my last worse When I'm gone, I'll make you nervous If you hurt me, I deserve it I've been acting foolishly Forgetting what you were You start loving me, I know this But even chaos serves a purpose It feels good to love somebody And somebody loves you bad So don't give in till you change mine Cause I'll be here for a lifetime You don't have to pretend to be me
