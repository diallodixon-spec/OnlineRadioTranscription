All right, we're back and Colin is saying the creative industry, bro. I'm assuming this is about how to raise money Simon I've been waiting for critic and Smithy's take on the Secretary of War and the Somalia issue. I'm a part of the program yesterday, I'm not sure if they spoke on it then. No, they didn't, Portland Lady. But we've been having problems with the lines, so I don't know if they tried to call in. The last time Kritik spoke on the, I asked him about the Somalia issue and Minnesota and his first comment was yeah but they're frauds aren't they? Which is really the heights of nonsense but nothing I don't expect from critics.
