20251217 133016 Lisa, it is so good to see you. But sorry you catch me like this, girl. My uncle sent one by a lot when my family got for clarity. You don't want to hear the price of the people they put on the something. Me matters the worst. Me hear say half of the thing they missing. And me know say a customs. Girl, how you know say a customs? Lisa, stop going like you're not having a sense, man. You know say everybody talk about it in the media.. You know, one of a stop, listen to here, say, you ever experienced that? Customs don't go into your package, suitcase, barrel or cargo unless you ship the item or the agent stand up right there when they're inspecting it. Listen, custom's job is to protect the borders, collect revenue and to facilitate trade. They don't collect or store shipment, they inspect it and somebody else represents it for inspection. So how do customs ever get so much custom then? Tracy, and the customs are alone involved in the clearance process, even though it's them we tend to talk about.
