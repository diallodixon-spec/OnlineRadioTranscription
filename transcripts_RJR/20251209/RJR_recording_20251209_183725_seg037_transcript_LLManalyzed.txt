Oh see, she says what is so special about my cake. No, no, no. First thing Veronica, you can't confuse cake and pudding are two different things. So tell me, either you make cake or either you make pudding or maybe you make both. But I can't have one thing you call cake and pudding, so make up your mind. All right, she says steam my fruits in wine and white rum, let it cool, blend it out in some more wine and rum, leave it to soak for months. After I take my Christmas pudding out of the oven, I pour some more rum and wine on it while it's hot, because it soak up the wine and the rum better when it's hot. After it's cool, I wrap it up to keep it moist. My Christmas pudding baked from last week. About August next year, I soak my fruits again for Christmas 2026. And she says it's mouth-watering. You know, Veronica all the time, she says self-praise is no recommendation. But I'm sure, I'm sure you're putting this.
