============================================================

And it's gonna be fine Out of all the people in the world I just can't believe you're mine In my life where everything was wrong Something finally went right Now there's two less lonely people in the world Tonight tonight just to think what I might have missed looking back how did I exist I dream still I never thought I'd come this far But miracles come true, I know cause here we are Two less lonely people in the world and it's gonna be fine
