20251223 215735 Thank you for that, Anthony. I'm here soon to Christopher. Chris? All right, let me tell you about this one real quick. I was before Wesley James. You know, you probably know him as Silverfoss. Of blessed memory, yes. Of blessed memory. Yes. We were in St Thomas Circuit. So I was a young Crown Council at the time. So, you know, I went out there. I planned to bag my birds and return back to the DPP's office. Yes. When I went out there, I see a big bullfrog with a big lock in their mouth. Oh, wow. You know, the usual thing. Yes. And I see that at the courtroom steps. Nobody was willing to come inside the courtroom, including the police officers. So I went to Wesley and I said, Wesley, what it is, what do you think we should do? Well, you say,, you've got to solve that, the problem. So I called Mr. Kent Patch, who was director at the time. I said, Kent, this is what is happening out here. I can't start my circuit. The jurors, they don't want to come in. The witnesses, they don't to come in. So I said, Town Z, I don't know what to tell you. Use your ingenuity.
