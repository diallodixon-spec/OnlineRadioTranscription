Yeah, with your hands in the air, jamming on a bomba. If you go back home with a different kind of smell, it'll cause problems. Oh, yeah, it'll go, cause problems. Oh yeah, it will. If you constantly have a story there to tell, it will cause problems, oh yeah, it will, cause problems. You better not just lie back to bed. Don't forget, you must go back home, go home After the past, don't forget, you must go back home Go home So when you see your mama lay't low low low low low When you see she friendly you start to whine low low low low high your fist, pant your waist Enjoy yourself, enjoy yourself
