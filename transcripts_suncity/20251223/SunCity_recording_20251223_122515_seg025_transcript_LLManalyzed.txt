20251223 122515 so i can't relate to desperation my kids are on vacation and i got this one boy and he won't stop calling When I walk this way I know I got him Too bad your ex don't do it for ya Walked in the dream, came through the fire Saw skin and I perfumed it for ya I know I'm not into it for ya Sat morning coffee, brewed it for ya Won't touch and I brand new water for you And now you think about me every night Oh, is it that sweet? I guess so So you can't sleep, baby, I know That's not me, I'm special Move it up, down, left, right, all Switchin' up like Nintendo
