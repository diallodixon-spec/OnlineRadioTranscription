to say what 450 my question would then be oh well if the multilaterals are lending the 450 why are we lending them 150 all right maybe we'll understand the finance we have no problem with that so that's where the confusion then came in that we the multilateral's will give them they'll be able to draw down 450 but we are nowhere near completion of that discussion blah blah blah is that cause the confusion? So up to now I still don't know because remember you know nobody says that we have now handed over 150 million to JPS Then Mr. Vaas comes out this morning to say that actually that 150 guarantees that the 170 linesmen are still here. And it will go to, you will see it in the equipment and the other 300 linesmen who are to come.
