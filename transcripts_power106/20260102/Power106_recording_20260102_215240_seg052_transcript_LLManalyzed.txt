20260102 215240 I woke up this morning and drove myself across the bay Alice went to Wonderland but I stayed home instead I started feeling bad cause I was left behind cause I'm a wanderer I'm a W. It's just a little time Cause I'm a wanderer, I travel every place Cause I'm a wonderer, I miss the outside space Cause I'm a Wonderer, got no time Cause I'm a Wanderer Just a Wanderer
