20251229 210405 DJ Frost, it's another one, oh, oh, oh. La-la-la, la-la-la. Yeah, yeah. It's a ocean of loving where you are for me. Hit the goals are you and I. Nothing no, that as the blue sea. Love me really and truly. And even though the suns will come, no, we won't rock. Just love me. Oh, you know. Deep as the blue see. Yeah, yeah, that you're deeper than the blue sea. I've seen many, but I still pick you just like a fruit tree. Look in my eyes, what do you see? I see you.
