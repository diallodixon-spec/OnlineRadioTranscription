20251212 205737 I just need some solitude When the world's driving me crazy Earth is shaking at my feet. Feel a weight upon my shoulder. You're my rescue. You're my remedy. Everything about you frees me. I relax and take it easy Cause you give me hope, hope You're like the morning sun And I'm not alone You give me hope
