20251226 134841 I'm going under in the time I feel there's no one to save me There's only nothing really going away driving me crazy I need somebody to heal, somebody to move Somebody to help, somebody to hold It's easy to say, but it's never the same I guess I kind of like the way you know door to door You know the day bleeds into nightfall And nightfall You know he is, he'll get me through it all I'll let my guard down, and then you pull the rug I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved I'm doing over and over again
