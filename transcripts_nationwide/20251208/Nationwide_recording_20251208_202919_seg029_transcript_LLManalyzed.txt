I know it's hard to look your best Wearing the same old shabby dress So you stay at home Waiting by the phone for another of them sweet lies But now you don't seem to wanna get rid of it Where the heart's not feeling what the brain's saying in your head Only yesterday I walked away You left my way and now you left me crying Girl you left me crying Gotta find my way through the downtown crowd Hoping cars and buses will help to drown this feeling Such a lonely feeling
