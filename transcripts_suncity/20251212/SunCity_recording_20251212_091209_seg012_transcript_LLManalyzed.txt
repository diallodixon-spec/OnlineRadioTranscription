2025-12-12 16:01:09 It's a beautiful day, it's a beautiful day Don't push and fight, let us unite We've got our lives, so let's make it right It's a Beautiful Day, it's a Beautiful Day So yeah, go wa wa through the valleys of the shadows of death. I will fear no evil won't be dismayed when I see the clock ticking away and things are not in place. Everything in life happens for a reason. Disappointment comes with a lesson. It's for me to get wiser, got for joy, thank you for pain, it's a beautiful day.
