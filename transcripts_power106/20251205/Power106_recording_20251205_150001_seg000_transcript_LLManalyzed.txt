Make sense to me? We can't have the taxpayer dollar going down the drain like this, you know. We talk about making Jamaica the place of choice to live, work, raise families and do business. We can't have money wasting like this. So whether it be your schools, your hospitals and your health institutions, your roads, other forms of public goods. When is your money on the line, taxpayer? You have to demand accountability. You have to. Contractors, developers and small builders, contact Coast-to-Coast Group of Companies for high quality concrete products. The time by Coast to Coast Group of Companies is 3 o'clock. Tune in to Power 106 FM for the longest running religious call-in program
