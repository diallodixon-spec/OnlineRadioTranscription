20251224 141108 She's the flower in my garden. Pretty little, pretty little, pretty little baby. The flower in my garden, girl. You are, you are the only you baby. You are only you baby. And I believe that love is a powerful thing. I'm feeling deep within. And if you believe in love, free up your mind, let this go within. As early as the morning star, I'm giving thanks for this lovely thing. Girl, you got to beat on my heart, beat on my heart. Me pray that truth never pass. And no other girl can hold me, hold me, hold so tight. Yeah, baby. None of them ever please me, sir, treat me, sir. Lord, you feel so right.
