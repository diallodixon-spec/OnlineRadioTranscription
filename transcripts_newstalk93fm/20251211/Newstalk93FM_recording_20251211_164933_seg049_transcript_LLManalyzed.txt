2025-12-12 10:34:48 I shift it to the fifth dimension. Fifth dimension. And the rhythm not a fit me religion. You get twist up and flat up like a Brazilian. Pile off your face with the mic in my hand. Then sip a cup of tea like I come from England. A long time I'm a DJ in a dance. A long time, I'm a chant in a dance. I come from the nice of the area. I come from nice of Jamaica. Watch your jet. Dance off the cop. Dance off the love. Lick off the love. Oh, Lord. Chalalalalalalala. Can't find no park cause the dance really cock. Gate man a laugh and the cashier a laugh. Can't find a bottle with a cup. Me say me can't find no space to walk. I need a food before the food itself. The gate man and he might be in a lot. Chalalalalala.
