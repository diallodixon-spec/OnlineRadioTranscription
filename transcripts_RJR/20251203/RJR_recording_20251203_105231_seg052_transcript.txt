We also want to touch on something at home. As we said, because this Christmas is coming right on the back end of a storm and we're still in recovery mode, a lot of persons will be getting packages from abroad or have shops and taking things. There are a few things we want to remind you of. When you're discarding your parcels, the containers, the boxes, please remove the labels. Your personal information is on those labels and you don't want that to get out into the public. So before you throw it in your garbage, it's advised that you remove those labels right on the packages. Shred or cut them up with a scissor so your personal information is not out there. If you're taking in commercial type bins, those huge cardboard boxes that you ship things into, please do not just put them outside the gate.
