at our current contributors. We're looking at former contributors as well especially to include our pensioners who you can appreciate would be in a position where you know they don't have incomes and even where they perhaps have incomes from side hustles or or other streams you know you can you can you can imagine that that is impacted at this time and so we're stretching ourselves as wide as possible to ensure that those who have been impacted get the support they need at this time. All right, so loans now. What kind of loan and how that works? We're offering a special home improvement loan to, again, people impacted. The loan amount is $3.5 million at an interest rate of 2% and payable over a period of 20 years or up until age 70, whichever comes first. And so the loan can be used to do repairs as a result of damage from the hurricane and not just repairs
