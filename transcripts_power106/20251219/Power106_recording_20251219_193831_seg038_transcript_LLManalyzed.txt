20251219 193831 runners take part and they will run this straight course. Now horse number six, Sweet Burn, here, quite well bred by Burn Identity over classic aspirin honey, honey rider, come out of our door, the Gouwitch. And the bred, of course, by Monique Azan. Very good evening to you, Mrs. Azan. Always looking lovely at the park. Now Radish Roman is the rider of Sweet Burn. And look into the form of all of of these horses and they have come to the conclusion that Sweetburn will be favorite. Will she give up her best possibility? She has been fairly consistent there and thereabouts and ran a race here surprisingly good. Half an inch second to Hickory Slim was won twice since. So on the basis of that, if you're doing form comparison, then she has the best form. It was written by a Roman, as I said. For Lawrence Fremantle, one of the hardest-working trainers, he also owns Sweetburn. So we wish him the best of luck. Alright, threats.
