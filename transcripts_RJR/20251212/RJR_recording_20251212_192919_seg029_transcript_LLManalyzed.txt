20251212 192919 We're going to have to pause the International Weekend story. Our listeners, thank you so much for being with us. Special thanks to Hal Shane Burke, who sat in for Deion Jackson Miller. And a special thanks also to Kevin White, production assistant. And of course, we have to big up Kenneth Reed. Kenneth, do you have any plans for the weekend? You know, Deion always asks that question. Work, work, work, and more work. Work, work work, as Rihanna would say. Nothing interesting, nothing exciting. No, it won't be work like Rihanna. It will work like Sunday at 12.15 right here on Radio Jamaica, 94FM. Have a good weekend!
