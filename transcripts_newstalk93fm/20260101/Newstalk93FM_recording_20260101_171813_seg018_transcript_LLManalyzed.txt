20260101 171813 I have a lightning spirit Early in the morning I had it Me cooler ready Me ice done ready Me punching that's automatic I have a lightning jumbie A kind of energy inside me And it ready for the rum, ready, ready for the rum Ready, ready, for the rum Ready for the action A spiritual encounter In me soul taking over Telling me to start up the drinking And do away with good behaviour So let we go Let we go down the road Let we go It's action time, let we go. It's back-and-on time. Let we go. Hands up. This vetting spirit of me feeling good.
