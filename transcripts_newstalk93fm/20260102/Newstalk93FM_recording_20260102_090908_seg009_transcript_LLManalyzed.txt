20260102 090908 You laugh and never say goodbye Those tears I cry now I can't get over it So don't you ever let me down again Cause I'm depending on you So you better come through this time Please hear my cry and if I ever let you down my friend it was a misunderstanding so we thought you'd get forgotten don't have promise from today I go drunk like I never drunk waved like I never waved whined like I never won before just to show you a side a side and I need you back in my life. Look at people buying a truck. Emotions running high. We are not in the sky. Just running down with high. Can't you tell that we sorry? We sorry. And we need you back in with high.
