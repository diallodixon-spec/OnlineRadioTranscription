20251218 114023 by the time we got up to Mount Pleasant, another tree in the way and Karjan had to come and use power saw and he requested a power saw of me and I'm so pleased to say that he's going to be getting the power saw now because we've managed to source it through Karen and Damien Ho. So Karjan is going to get a power saw and then further on the road by Copen the truck stuck and we couldn't move light wire come down power way and it's how it was lifted up just to get us through. So we prepared the chicken in Kingston. We prepare the carrot and the sweet the Irish potato and we need the dumpling and you're not cooking the soup out there. We're doing all of that on top of everything else that we're giving out. Yeah. Yeah. And you cater as well. You. Yes. Yeah, I do catering. I mean, but you know, we have KFC on board with us. Yes, this time. And you know, that. Yeah. You know, KFC is it. Yeah.
