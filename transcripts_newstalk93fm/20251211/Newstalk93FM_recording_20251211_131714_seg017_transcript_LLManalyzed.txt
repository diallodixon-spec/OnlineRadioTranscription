============================================================

Why are you so quick to leave When we both can make it work When I'm gone, I'll make you nervous nervous if you hurt me I deserve it I've been acting foolishly forgetting what you were you start loving me I know this but even chaos serves a purpose it feels good to love somebody if somebody loves you back so don't give give in to your chains, boy. Cause I'll be here for a lifetime. You don't have to pretend to bow because it's Christmas right now. Now, guess it's time to the good times. And I'll be gone by the sunrise. I'll be back down on my own.
