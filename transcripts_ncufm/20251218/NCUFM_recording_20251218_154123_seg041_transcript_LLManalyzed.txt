20251218 154123 into the sea of forgetfulness, you placed all of my sins, for I'm the one who keeps reminding you over and over again, into the sea, of forgetfulness, as far as the east from the west, seventy times seven, you've forgiven me, and you keep cleansing me And placing my sin into the sea of forgetfulness You welcome me with open arms of mercy In spite of all I've done, you still keep loving me
