If I could read your mind, love What a pale your thoughts could tell Just like a paper bag in our home All the kind that drugs don't sell And when you reach the part Where the heartaches come The heroine would be me The heroine's walkin' back And you won't read that book again Because the ending's just too hard to take Boy, you should know that I've got you on my mind
