20251224 172017 Welcome to Auto World on Power 106 FM. I'm Shelen McLaggen. Wednesday, December 24th, 2025. And yes, it is Christmas Eve and we're on the cusp of the holiday that has actually started. And it's very chaotic on the roads and I'm imploring everybody to be careful when you're out there traversing. Today we are going to be looking again at safety but we're looking at it in another way as we're going to be joining Miss Diane Ashton Smith, head of corporate affairs of Red Stripe as we focus on the national drink ride campaign and this is Red Stripe's contribution to road safety, reducing drinking and driving. So I'm going to give you all the features of this and this is something that Red Stripe has been doing for quite a number of years now. So we're going to see how it is that this campaign has accelerated as well.
