20251223 215835 So I went downstairs and I got some talcum powder from one of the ladies in the office, in the court's office. I put it in the envelope. I get a red handkerchief, you know, the bandana. I came upstairs and I kicked with the bullfrog. I burst the envelope open and clap it and make the smoke come up. And then I use the handkerchief to wipe my face. And I said, look here, no one of your own here is stronger than my own. When you come inside. One by one they came in and that is how circuit started. think about the problem and find the solution the solution is available you just have to think outside the box sometimes yes um you're saying i would love to come to you yeah
