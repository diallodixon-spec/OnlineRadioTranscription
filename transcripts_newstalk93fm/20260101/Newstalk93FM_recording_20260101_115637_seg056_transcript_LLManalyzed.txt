20260101 115637 I know I'm cute and funny. I know somebody want me. I might go sell a bit. I know I make some money. Outside, lover outside. But be sick when the girls get some outside, huh, honey. Bathing suit, body suit, trying to let this body loose. This tequila 90 proof, chasing with my juice. Heard them patrons got them, let me in the locker room. And some ladies out in Vegas, as your word was popping boo. Booty cheeks got a shake. Flirty, got some pain. Let me know the time and place. I'm just trying to ride this. PJKK, take me somewhere tropical. Spidey, find me a suit. Stewart driver, kind of cute. When I tell you these ain't shit, please believe me. They don't fuck on anything. These way too easy. Good for nothing. Load on dirty dogs. I'm convinced. Next time you see your mama, tell her how she raised a ****in' boy. Out on the pop out. Cause it's hot out. You was playing games. And you on time out. We don't bond. Don't try to find. I've been cuffed up too long. Let me remind you.
