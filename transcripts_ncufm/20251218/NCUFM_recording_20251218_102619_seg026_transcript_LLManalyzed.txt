My uncle said when I'm bailing, when my family go for clarity, you don't want to hear the price of the people they put on the something. But the matter is worse, me hear say half of the thing they're missing, and me know say a custom. Girl, how you know say a customs? Lisa, stop going like you're not having a sense, man. You know say everybody will talk about it in the media. You know, us stop listen to hear say yeah, I experienced that Customs not going to your package Suitcase barrel or cargo unless you worship the item or the agents stand up right there when they might inspect it listen Customs job is to protect the borders collect revenue and the facilitate trade. They don't collect or store shipment, they inspect it and somebody is represented for inspection. So how do customers ever get so much cost in them? Tracy, and the customers are alone involved in the clearance process even though they are the ones we tend to talk about.
