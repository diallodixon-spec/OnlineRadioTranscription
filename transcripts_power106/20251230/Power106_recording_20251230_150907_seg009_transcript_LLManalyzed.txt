So basically, I was asked by various community schools and pageants to always be a judge or to be the chief judge for their competition. But within my sitting at their panels, I used to say to myself, I don't think these girls should be going on the so much diasterein as it relates to itself. And so I say to myself I need to create a pageant that speaks to the child, the children of Jamaica and not necessarily the facade of the makeup and the, you know, sewer category, because I don't think at 9 or 10 or 12 years old you should be parading on a stage in a sewer. And so then Minnie Misentan was born from that idea.
