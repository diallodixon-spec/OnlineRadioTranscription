20251230 144829 I got a knock on wood All that missing, wishing, all the falling stars Never did me any good I ain't got no knock on wood It's you and me forever dancing in the dark Over me, it's undisputed I ain't got to knock on wood Forgive me, it sounds cocky Hypnotize me and opened my eyes Redwood tree, it ain't hard to see His love was the key that opened my skies Girls, I don't need to catch the bouquet To know a hard rock
