about on category five hurricane because I years now it has been happening years it has been happening we only getting a little service now because them start put arm after me called Dr. Taylor last week missy they run company that you are highly regenerated them at the cell site they weren't doing anything so I mean I was told arm that you have interview, so I'm not gonna keep you. I'm okay. It's good to hear you, man. I'm trying to help some people. I'm gonna try to, even though I'm helping people, but some people out there still need help. So I just went and purchased some mattress and I'm waiting on a van to come and pick them up so the people can sleep on a mattress. Nice. For the first time since the hurricane. Are you start eat again or I need to send Lampile for you? No, I'll tell you Lampile about two weeks after. Okay and now that you hear me you can go take some iron.
