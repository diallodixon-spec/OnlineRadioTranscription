20251223 200608 We shall ask, as a trivia, when our anniversary is, what month it is, probably at some point later on, I'll offer some kind of a gift to the person who can get it right. All right. Without using their phones. Although you just gave them. I just said it. Yeah, you just said it. If they're listening, if they're avid listeners, as they sometimes claim to be, they should be able to tell us. There's a lot of people you listen to, you know, Mrs. G, listen to your radio voice, your your sweet, smooth radio voice and they ask, you know, I don't understand this. Maybe you can help me. Why is it that when I meet somebody, they say, tell me something. You and your wife on the radio, right? I say yes. Should the voice training or something? They don't ask me if I had a voice training. They ask if you do voice training. Why is that? Can you say why it is that nobody asked me if I did voice training? Because you're more of a natural. Yes, yes, and you're hurt. And a doctor, you can be fluent as you need to be.
