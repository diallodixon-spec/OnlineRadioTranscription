20251219 120709 You don't have to be afraid Remember the words I say Wednesday I'll be coming home to you To you, to you We don't have to fight baby Come and take a life with me I swear to the sun, replace the moon Don't send a surprise, it's a blind date I'll turn the road, I'll line it Tell them that it's over, I'm late Tell them that you sold out, I'm late I won't see me Wednesday
