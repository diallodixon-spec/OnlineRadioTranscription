It's and we've got the same church. Church camp. Yeah. It's true. Now, two thousand. Tell me the story. Now, where you go? You know, tell me. I make four. Alright, so, so, we're the same church. Um as she said, we go on camp one time. We go camp, you know, as a young man. You know, new people, because this is a camp, right? Churches from all over come together. You know, you're trying to meet new people, but you just hang on for me, you know what I mean? So we were just friends at the time. That's it. We were nothing more. Only two persons from our church. We had to stick to the family. I was blocking the progress it looked like.
