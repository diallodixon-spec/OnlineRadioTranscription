20251225 183532 You know I'm no beginner My heart's been to the wall I'm a tried and true romantic Who's seen and done it all And when you walked into my life Suddenly I knew All the love I had inside Was meeting with you In my time I gave you love so much Through which I know I let my heart be touched In my time Isn't much I miss I've seen love come and go But heaven knows I've never loved like this in my life
