2025-12-12 13:02:50 I can't feel it in the air My cold sweat drippin' everywhere I'm all, I don't even care As long as you're Right here, playin' in my bed I'm fallin', whatever you say I'm all in, I couldn't care less as long as you're Burning blue Burning blue I'm burning blue I'm letting it burn, letting it burn It's so silly of me to act like I don't need you back When all, all I can think about is us since I seen you last I know I didn't have to walk away All I had to do was ask for you
