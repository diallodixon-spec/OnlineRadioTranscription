20251218 175745 have this area as really that historic zone. So I think, as the Prime Minister has said, we're going to have the National Reconstruction Authority that will do some studies and some visioning and some architectural designs, look at ecological studies, where the best place to put these things. But definitely, and he drove through with me last week, Friday, and we literally went back to the route that he came the day after and started to have some of those conversations. I'm very confident that he is passionate about keeping the character but building it back better. One of the important things though, Minister, is going to be community involvement. Absolutely. Because too often we hear about, you know, decisions being made in offices in town or whatever and the people with the local knowledge and experience aren't brought into these conversations. Is that something that's going to be prioritized? It's going to be prioritize and the truth is, if you know St. Elizabeth people, there's no other way, right? We have very strong community structures. We have strong community leaders.
