20260101 194728 So many people won't lick my skews So baby chew me cause I serve your tools And if I undo your two by two You fit to scream you can lose in your pool So many reasons are written in the stars On my card you're the reason I do what I do So baby make you give me that love. If you give me me, I'm not gonna let go. Give me me kakyo, my zanko. Feelings got me hitting on the freaky dance floor. Make me give me that love, if you give me me I'm not going to let go. Make me make kakyo my zanko, feelings got me hitting on a freaky dance floor If I give you my love, make you no disappointo, me I got you from endo.
