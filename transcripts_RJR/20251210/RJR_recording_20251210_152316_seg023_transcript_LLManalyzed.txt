Just look in my eyes, there'll be no surprise You'll find the window to love And I'll do anything in my power To welcome you and please you too But deep, in my heart Deep in my heart I know you're the one for me Love is a house and you got a dream To take me where I wanna be Open up and let me into your heart Baby, just look what you'll see
