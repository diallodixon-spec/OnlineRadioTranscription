20251230 183720 I don't get the time for the hate and the bad energy Cause my mind on my money Make you dance like broccoli Steady green like broccoli Steady on my grind, don't hear what they want Telling me you could deny my fantasy Don't want to check if my tap ain't no rush But if they rush, if they rush, fire well it be much Nobody make my tap if they rush They. There's no don't us There's no darling
