20251218 110102 Good morning. In the Rural Headline News at this hour, the Rural Agricultural Development Authority, RADA, in St. Thomas is making strides in post-Orican Melissa recovery efforts. RADA says the 3.2 kilometers of farm roads at the Planting Garden River Agri-Park in Golden Grove have been rehabilitated. Roger says the resurfaced road will provide easier access for farmers, ensuring safer and more efficient transportation of produce and equipment. The improvement is expected to reduce costs and strengthen the agricultural supply chain. Farmers are welcoming the project, saying it will help them reach markets more reliably and support local economic growth. Sub motorists are warning that a serious and dangerous accident is waiting to happen at the intersection Mirimar Drive, License and Wharf Road in Moran Bay.
