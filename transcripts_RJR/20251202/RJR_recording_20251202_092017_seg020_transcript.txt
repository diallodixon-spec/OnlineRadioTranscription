Sorry about that. Later on in the program. And of course, we were looking at several issues which arise and hopefully we'll hear from you. Good item on news last night. So where Jamaica and is it France, the Red Cross? Yes. In terms of desalination. And of course that is purifying water. And I must say that I also have been made aware that the Consul General of Bahamas this evening was similarly engaged in helping to provide desalinated water. And so that is so good, because as we are are facing the challenges we welcome efforts that have been brought to bear to help us and to help our people to get through these very difficult times really happy to know that as well all right let's try the phones again good morning welcome
