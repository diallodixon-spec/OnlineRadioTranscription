20260101 211611 Can anybody help me? I'm out of plans Guess I left my world in somebody's hands I don't like to hurt my But everyone gets weak Someone to rely on Is what I really need Now here we stand With all that we're worth I've been through the pain And been dragged through the dark Whatever they tell you We're bigger than words I've been where you're standing, I know how it hurts Let this be your song now, and this be your day When we stand together, then we'll be okay Cause we're survivors, we're making a world
