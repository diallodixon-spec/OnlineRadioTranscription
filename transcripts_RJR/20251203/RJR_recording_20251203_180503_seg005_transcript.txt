Hurricane Resilient Housing in the wake of Hurricane Melissa. The Incorporated Master Builders Association of Jamaica, Jamaica Institution of Engineers, and Jamaica Institute of Architects say temporary shipping containers should only be used for emergency relief, not long-term housing. In a joint statement, the groups stressed that block and steel reinforced concrete and engineered timber homes are essential for long-term recovery, pointing out that professionally built homes withstand hurricanes far better than makeshift structures. Last month, Prime Minister Dr. Andrew Holness announced that the National Housing Trust would purchase 5,000 foldable container units, some to sell and some for social housing. While containers provide rapid relief, the Prime Minister says the long-term focus will remain on safe, resilient communities. The professional groups emphasize the importance of local expertise, strict enforcement of building code, and affordable starter homes in rebuilding efforts.
