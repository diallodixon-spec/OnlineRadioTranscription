You know, say you have the memory of an elephant. No, man, I didn't read that thing. We just talked about it a while ago. And my producer had found some newspaper articles supporting the claim that the caller made yesterday. Yes. Alright, tell me something. What was that man named Enoch? Papa Nana. Papa Nana is not Enoch, he's Enoch. Enoch Blake. Enoch Blake? Enoch? Yes sir. How would he say? Yes sir, Enoch Blake. Enoch? Yes sir. Ah what me say? You say Enoch. Sorry, sorry, sorry. Sorry John. Yeah man, no problem, no problem. Sorry, it's terrible, let me know. Yes sir. Alright. So listen to me now, you see that? Kick him away, fall down man. Who? Kick him away and fall down.
