Wait a minute. This is too deep. My element. Come back, baby. Please call me. Leave me alone. Get out. Who else am I gonna leave? No one time zero. Who's gonna talk to me when the phone to the sun comes up? Who's gonna take you? Please, there ain't nobody there. Oh, baby, baby, leave me alone. Give me back, baby. Give me back.
