In a recent interview on Power Talk, Christopher Thomas, Senior Investment Advisor at Maybear Investment Group Limited, discussed the latest developments in the local equities and bond markets. Thomas noted that on the last day of the year, 114 stocks were traded, with 58 advancing and 36 declining. He also highlighted the performance of various indices, including the JSE combined index, which advanced by 2,179 points or 0.67%.

Thomas expressed optimism about the stock market, stating that he expects 2026 to be a vibrant year with more opportunities for growth. He also discussed the recent listing of West Indies Petroleum Terminal, which has seen a significant increase in stock price due to limited supply.

When asked about the performance of specific companies, Thomas mentioned that Wigton Energy, Innovative Energy Group, and Trans Jamaica Highway Jamaican Dollar Shares were among the top volume leaders. He also noted that some companies, such as Grace Kennedy Limited, have seen significant declines in stock price.

**Interview 2: Michael, Economist**

In another interview on Power Talk, economist Michael discussed the recent 5.1% recovery in Jamaica's GDP in the third quarter of last year compared to the same quarter in 2024. However, Michael expressed skepticism about the accuracy of this figure, citing the revision of the previous year's GDP decline from 5.5% to 3.2%.

Michael questioned the drivers of the 5.1% growth, noting that the economy is still experiencing instability and a lack of investor confidence. He also pointed out that the import and export numbers do not support the claimed growth, with imports increasing by 3.8% and exports declining by 2.9%.

The host and Michael engaged in a detailed discussion about the GDP growth, with Michael emphasizing the need for accurate data collection and proper planning to allocate limited resources effectively. He also stressed the importance of understanding the economic principles and theories guiding the country's economic decisions, particularly in light of the predicted negative 6% growth in the fourth quarter.
