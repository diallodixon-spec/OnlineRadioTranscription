20251226 194024 I'm changing hands, cause I guarantee my God will be there on time. So hold on. Somebody needs to know. All you're gonna do is hold on. Cause my God will make it all right. There are times when you have to cry And there are times when you wanna ask why So don't let go of his unchanging hand Cause I guarantee that he'll be there on time He'll be alright
