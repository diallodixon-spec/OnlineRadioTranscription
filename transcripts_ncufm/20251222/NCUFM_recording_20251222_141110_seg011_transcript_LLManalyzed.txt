20251222 141110 I will say, though there has been a lack of sleep on my end, it has been a fantastic weekend. I was communion, I had some communion this Sabbath. It was very, in some really good company. And then yesterday there came an event, a very exciting event. And I just had to attend. And yes, I might have sacrificed some sleep. But we all had a wonderful time in the Lord. Amen and amen. And so we're here to celebrate the brand new week. I know that a lot of you right now, OK, look at that it's raining outside here right here in Mandeville and I hope you have the umbrellas out there and I'd say it's just it's just some sudden rain but yes it's yeah though the rain's poor it is still a blessing
