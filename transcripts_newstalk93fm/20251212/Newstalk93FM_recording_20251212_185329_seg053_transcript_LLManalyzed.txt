20251212 185329 So I pressed up the top, that's quite fine To me Sitting under the sunlight Listening to music, that's a lie It's gonna be a good day It's gonna be, it's gonna be, a good day We just started my life Me, I watch, we eatin' on my side Outfit, take care of me and mine. No off, no times, and no press cast vibe. No, no, this how we move. Me just a walk and I move. Gonna make me rock and move.
