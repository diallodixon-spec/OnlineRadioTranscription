Thank you very much Donovan. That was Donovan Wignall, immediate past president of MSME Alliance and a former ranking member of the now defunct EPOC talking with us about comments by the financial secretary that the 10 billion dollars for the DPJ is not included in the supplementary debt. EPOC is defunct. EPOC does not lie in the office of the fiscal commissioner. There time is now 10.30.
