In order to adequately prepare for the passage of a storm like Melissa, it would be prudent for the stakeholders at the JPS to relocate their LNG facilities days before. How many days before? We don't know. I think that was what Mr. Paul was speaking about. But it's a very, very tedious position for the Jamaica Public Service right now. All right. So we did say in line with the start of the winter tourist season, that we would have a conversation with Vanatela out of St Anne the Garden Parish. Vanatela now joins us online. She is area chairman for Ocho Rios and Runaway Bay.
