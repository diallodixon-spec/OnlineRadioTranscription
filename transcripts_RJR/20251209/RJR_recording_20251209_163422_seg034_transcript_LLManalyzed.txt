Yeah, we saw some snippets of that earlier. Yeah, because Buster Reims-Bergine, welcome, welcome home. Welcome, welcome, welcome, welcome. And right away Buster went straight to the West, you know what I mean? Yeah, yeah, yeah, straight to business. It's great to see. Yeah, man, Buster back home. Shansia also recently made sure that she, you know, put in, you know, her two-piece. Yeah, yeah, we appreciate it. So again, the celebrities are showing up for Jamaica. Yeah man, they're on the ground and they're doing the work. Yes, doing the work. And they're not just sending the stuff there, they're outside too. Accompanying them themselves. I also saw a video with Romain Virgo and his wife and his team in the West. They've continued to do their part as well. Tyrese I think released a song. Hopefully we're gonna get to play it soon but I believe when I went on his page he dedicated one of the songs he's working on to Jamaica as well to mark his trip I guess while he came here. It's good to see
