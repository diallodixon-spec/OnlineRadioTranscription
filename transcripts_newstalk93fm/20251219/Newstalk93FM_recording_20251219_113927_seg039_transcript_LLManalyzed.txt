20251219 113927 This is my apology Follow me Come and see What you mean to all of me You're a treasure in my eyes The greatest pleasure in my life Cause when you live deeper than me Honesty, hurry please Whom is better I should be? Pretty feathers in disguise Not together we will rise So don't you ever Let me down So you better come through this time, please hear my cry And if I ever Let you down my friend It was misunderstanding. So if I took it for granted, you're not promised from today. I go jump like I never jumped, wait like I never went, run like I never wanted to, just to show you I saw you, I saw you, and I need you back in my life.
