I'm done hiding, now I'm shining like I'm gonna be We dreaming hard, we came so far, now I believe We're going up, up, up, it's our moment You know together we're going up, up, up. It's our moment. You know together we're glowing. Gonna be, gonna be golden. Up, up, up with our voices. Going to get you so wanted. Gonna be gonna be golden. I'm done hiding. now I'm shining like I'm born to be Oh, our time, no fears, no lies, that's who we're born to be Waited so long to break these walls down
