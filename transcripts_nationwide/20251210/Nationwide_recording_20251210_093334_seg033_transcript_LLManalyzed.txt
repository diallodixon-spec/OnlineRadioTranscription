I want those of us who have a comfortable bed to sleep in, some of us with air condition, TV, phone service, cable and internet, food in our cupboard and fridges, a business or a job and a salary, a place to go for a drink to get rid of the stress that there are tens of thousands who don't and their only wish now would be for a tarpaulin to cover them from rain and sun and a bottle of water to quench their thirst and maybe a diaper for their young child. We as a government, we feel your pain and this is why we have given you the electricity plan that we have given you today.
