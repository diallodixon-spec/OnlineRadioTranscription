20251230 161411 Down round bus a kiss for me darling Tell her say honey me not touchin' on the street In the street me see poor people ballin' Up chuppin' all these onion from my money Where the black woman future me oxin' Where the system a do be she, do be she I'm coming a place, here dog eat dog, I know about it in my heart. From my barn, we see people a star, when they get beat by Sarge. It hurt me hard, when a dog reach at the mark, the next day him the fly go round. That's why, me never chop my yard, now me a victim of the Sarge.
