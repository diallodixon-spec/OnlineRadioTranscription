20251212 194032 work to do to get to the frame. We have this American now, number six, Rives Treasure. Winner. It's a good time, 1 minute 21 and one-fifth of a second, given the speed of track. Winning one over six and a half was on the 16th of November. Right. Came last week and was prominent for a long way and looks likely to come back and run a very good race here. Shane Richards, who won one aboard this horse, will be in the saddle once most. So I'm expecting a very good run from Brad Streater. So we look at the selections. Now number two, lockdown. But before I get to that, number one, Brompton Boar with Roman Hough. Will come running on. That's how he likes to do it. And with some good pace in the race, could make it onto the frame, so don't forget that. But number two, lockdown, is my firm choice. So my number eight, Danka. And number six, Rad's Treasure.
