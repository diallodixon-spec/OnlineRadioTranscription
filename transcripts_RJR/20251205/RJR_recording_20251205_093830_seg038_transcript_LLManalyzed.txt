I got it, I got it. Let me just recap last week. Thank you very much. Who do we have online? Anybody with you? Yes. Laurie's there? No? Laurie Farron there? All right, we'll see if we can join Laurie. So last week, just recapping the conversation, we spent some time, Laurie was on last week. And so we brought him back to complete the conversation because we spent some time walking listeners through just the NHT relief facilities, even though we have been saying it, promoting it, it bears repeating because persons are getting the information, you know, in spoonfuls, sometimes, you know, because persons are just coming back online, persons are just hearing hearing about it and so we're still pushing the relief initiatives but a key part of what we were discussing last week was you know what methodologies should you use to rebuild so just to remind listeners about our hurricane
