Classic, eh? Never make the same mistake twice if you don't have to, please don't let it happen, eh? It is 8.31 right here. Sorry, 9.31 on the 94. Where's my glasses? Come on, come on, give me that, give me that. All right, tell you what, report it immediately by calling 2-1-1. Let's protect our children, no matter where they are. If something doesn't feel right, speak up. Every child deserves to be safe. A message brought to you by UNICEF.
