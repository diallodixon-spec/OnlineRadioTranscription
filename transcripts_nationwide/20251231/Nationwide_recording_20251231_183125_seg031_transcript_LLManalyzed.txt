20251231 183125 many people, people who are on the bench, people who are elsewhere in the public service abroad have been mentored through these hands and to be alive and well to see the appreciation from my staff on Saturday was a great thing and I thank them. But that is the only thing that would hurt me if members of my staff are hurt or hurting, nothing else, because let us face it. As a public officer, you cannot be a shame, old lady. You know the shame, old lady, that curl up as I touch it, because it means that you'd be giving political figures the power that if they want to get rid of you or to make you political, all they have to do is get trolls or psychopaths or anybody to start to call up your name and call up your name. Can you imagine what that would do? They could then target anybody and without more, within a day or two, where there's no basis because the person's not done anything wrong.
