20260102 161813 I wrote an article about spice being the performer of the year you guys can check it out on world music views well the music views named her as performer of the year and I'm telling you it is well-deserved and she's so very happy with the article and I'm happy that she is you guys you can check it out but spice is phenomenal like you know the work ethic that she puts in the drive when spice touches a stage in stage and what she has done in 2025 alongside Vibes Cartel is nothing but just sort of life-changing for the genre itself. I just want to say big up Spice. We look forward to what you're gonna do in 2026 in all these new colors. So if you guys are watching on YouTube there is a photo of her in the new colour here and all these things. Looking very demure. I love it. Now guys, next on my list of things, a TikTok creator sparked a heated controversy from her commentary on women's behaviour during marriage proposals. Now we do have a video of her.
