20251231 142414 You get me up, I'm so high You drain me up, you rock the boat I'm in no time, I'm just a bit right now But you're always up on my mind I know you said not to call you again I miss you And I hope I can see you one more day when I hope you're good, I hope you're well, I hope you live. I miss your touch, I miss your smell, I miss your lips. Maybe grab a drink, maybe grab some food, don't miss you. Call my mama, baby. I know it's hard to help.
