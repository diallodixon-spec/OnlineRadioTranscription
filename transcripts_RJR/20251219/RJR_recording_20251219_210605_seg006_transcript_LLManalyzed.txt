20251219 210605 When did you get um get started in the business? I mean, how long have you been around? I mean, did you have you just gotten started or you've been around for a little bit? No, I've been in music for a very long time a lot of struggling ups and down, but I still don't give up And I stand I still long give up until I met King Father Shiloh, you understand? Yeah. All right. Tell us some of the songs that you'd have done over the period of your career since you've been around to know. A lot of songs, you know. I've done a song with Daddy English. And I'd done a song with Predator, you know, named Old Man, you know. It's a gimmick song, not just to hurt my elders, you understand? But with a song played on the radio, you understand? Yeah, and I've done a song with that also, Wayne Lonesome, you know, combination. And I've done some on my own too, which was playing also on the radio, but I don't agree to get that justice. But I give thanks, you know, doing this because it's me.
