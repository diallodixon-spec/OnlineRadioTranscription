20251224 135442 Simon Sheppard is right. Manley destroyed Jamaica. Michael Manley too, aka, also known as Bamdan, is going to destroy. Yeah, he said that already. Critic. So one man can destroy the greatest city in the world, according to him, and the largest state. I don't think so. Simon Sheppard is spreading propaganda. Good were taking off the shelves in the late 70s and were married to destabilize the man, the government. That's Peter from Highgate. Simon, you waste too much with this back-of-time brother just holding up the program. Dunst will always be Dunce, that is Shepherd, he's so living in the past, it's had pure garbage. They're just endorsing rubbish. Okay, that's from Biggs. Why, I'm running out of time.
