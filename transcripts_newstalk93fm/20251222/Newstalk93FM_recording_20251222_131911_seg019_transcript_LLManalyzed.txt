20251222 131911 I said they not think they do, start they move, start they move. Like you smoke a la groove, just they bounce with the groove. Look how they do, if you lose guard then go bounce with your boo. I can vouch for my groove, I'm telling you, until they do. Lifestyle of a crew, make you dance, know they look. Know they look, know they look, that's if it's not enough. If I do 99, go dig or even one. Don't know how to hear my mataké like for life of a day I want to be celebrated Don't wanna waste my days I want to spend them on enjoyment It's been too long
