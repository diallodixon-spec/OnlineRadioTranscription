Principal of York Castle High School, Raymond Tresher. Prime Minister Dr. Andrew Holness has left the island for official duties in New York. He is scheduled to return to Jamaica Saturday, December 6.

A man alleged to be the founder and leader of a Haitian gang was sentenced on Wednesday to life in prison in the United States for orchestrating the kidnapping of 17 people, including five children, who were on a mission trip to the Caribbean country. Jolli Germain declined to say anything before U.S. District Judge John Bates in Washington, D.C. Before he was sentenced, the judge stated that Germain had shown no remorse for his crimes. But some of the victims chose to speak in court, telling German that they forgave him for his role in their ordeal.
