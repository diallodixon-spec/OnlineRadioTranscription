And nothing we need for your fun. It's like a family reunion we're having. Plus, greetings I sent from far in. Every belly full from Christmas Eve. And Grand Market we have to clean. Don't want no gun shot to go sin on the street. Put down your gun, then please. I make we have a crime-free Christmas time. No, let blood shed, broke with vibes. No, oh, oh, no, oh, oh. Oh, oh, yeah. Crime-free Christmas time, no, let blood shed.
