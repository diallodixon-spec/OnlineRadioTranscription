And I must advise you though finally to seek medical attention only if the cough lasts longer than two weeks, if your symptoms become more frequent or they worsen, if you get a fever that persists and if breathing becomes more difficult and that can come with the chest pain or wheezing or maybe if you're coughing up blood.

Paying attention to changes in symptoms ensures early intervention and better health outcomes.
