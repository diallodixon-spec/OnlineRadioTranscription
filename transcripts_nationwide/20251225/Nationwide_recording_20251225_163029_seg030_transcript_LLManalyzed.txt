I wonder what can make you stray I love you baby, anyway I never buy your fancy clothes I never bought you chocolate or oats I wonder if it's things like those That make you go away I know your friends been telling me They should buy my T.F.L. I don't even them What am I to do? And I know you're ready for what I say Know you've seen many faces Know I'll have to try something Wanna go out with you? Will I love you? Can I wish you the best? I just got a letter from my baby, she write me, oh I got to let her go
