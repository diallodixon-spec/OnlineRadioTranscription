20251230 114235 Congratulations, he held steady and he was swift on the buzzer, but Big Up Team record the same way, when they have nothing for shame about. We had him. We had him pressured. In the bar, one minute, they keep thinking they're going to do. But, yeah. Congratulations, sir. Thank you very much, sir. I want to say thanks to the organizers. This wasn't easy. And so from the producer, Sonia Stewart, to Natalie Anita, Kevin on the controls, the app called Kevin Williams, Lunette, Jada, all of the organizers. I want to say thank you to all of them. Simone and Ginan, of course. Michael Paul. And thanks to all of the viewers who made this a special thing. This is why you are all part of the Nationwide family. Salute to the YouTubers as well. We love you. The banter and everything and we love what you brought into it. We love how you get vexed. Because that's what the competition needs and thanks of course to every single sponsor who has come on board.
