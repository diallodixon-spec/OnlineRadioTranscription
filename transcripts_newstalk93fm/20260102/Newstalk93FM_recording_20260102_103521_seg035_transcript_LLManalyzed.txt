20260102 103521 Hello. I hope you're good, I hope you're well, I hope you live. I miss your touch, I miss your smell, I miss your lips. Maybe grab a drink, maybe grab some food, don't be ashamed. I know it's hard, but I don't have no glass. I had to protect my heart, and help the one so torn I couldn't look over, I need to touch you One more time, one more time I'll take you one by five, and I don't know why And though you said not to call you again when I miss you And I hope I can see you one more time when I miss you
