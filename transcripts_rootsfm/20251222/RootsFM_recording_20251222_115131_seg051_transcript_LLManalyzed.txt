20251222 115131 May your hand of healing spread out over the length and breadth of this country. Remember those, mighty God, who have affirmed their commitment to you, even them this morning. Remember them in your mercy. I pray, mighty God, that you will heal them. I pray that you will grant those who are the caregivers the patience and the love to deal with them. I pray for the medical staff, mighty God, with a hospital that deals with them, that they will have the wisdom, the non-understanding and the patience and the love and the care as they deal with those who are in pain. And may your peace, God, rest upon those who as they labor, mighty God, that they will not fear, O God, weary in well-doing, but they will glorify you nonetheless. So this morning, Father, thank you for hearing us. Thank you for standing
