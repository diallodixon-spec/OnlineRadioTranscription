So you ain't gotta pay for drinks, no more more Cause I done found what I've been looking for all along I'm talking about where they rang everything I'm talking about swimming in measurements You can't get a damn fitting in the back of my truck for me. Don't take your love for me. Clearly, you need a club oven. You need a club oven, you need a love oven. Baby, I'm over something. You make me feel good.
