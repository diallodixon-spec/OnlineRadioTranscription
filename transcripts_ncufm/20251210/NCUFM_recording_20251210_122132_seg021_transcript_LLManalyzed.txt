Oh, disappointment, had my share of disappointment, yeah. But I'm still here. Oh, lonely nights, I had my share of lonely nights But I'm still here Through it all I made it through another day's journey It was God that kept me here. Threw it all, threw it all away. I made it through another day's journey, another day's journey. Oh, yeah.
