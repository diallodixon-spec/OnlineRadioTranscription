This is Tannis Morrison, aka Soul Child Tannis, and you are listening to Sun City Radio. Radio with a difference, rebuilding Jamaica. The beat of the drum, the strumming of the bass guitar, the unison of the keyboard, the steadiness of the rhythm guitar, energy from the percussion, and the voice cementing the sound. This is reggae music, the coming together of swords uniting the world in harmony and peace. Doing a rental or building from scratch? Get more for your money!
