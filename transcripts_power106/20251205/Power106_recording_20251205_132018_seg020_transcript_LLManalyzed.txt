Good afternoon, Simon. How are you? Good, man. What's up? Why am I there? There's something I want to get some clarification on, or if you have any insight more than I do. I see the Maroon chief put out a video saying you don't want the help from the government, but you'll take the supplies. Is he in any position to even dictate to the government whether they come in or not to help them? Well, that's what I was thinking. I've spoken to constitutional scholars and so on and they deny that this is even a reality.
