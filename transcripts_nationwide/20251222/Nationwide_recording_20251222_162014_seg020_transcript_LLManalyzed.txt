20251222 162014 very picky eater when i was younger so like jackie used to have to beat me for eat right and as i've said many many times the first time that my mom cooked like um a home cooked meal i was like in sixth grade right so it wasn't like a thing for me so when i used to like go to school and then i put the porridge on them something they like it used to just upset my stomach and then then one time Jackie they beat me to eat the cornmeal porridge so I think because of that the trauma from that so a lot of the things that I don't eat now is because like she used to force me to to see. It's actually cornmeal porridge. That's like at the bottom of the list of porridge.
