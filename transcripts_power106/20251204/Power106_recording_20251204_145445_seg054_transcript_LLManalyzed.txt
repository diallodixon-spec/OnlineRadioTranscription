Tis the season Dark tan and nylon won't be freezing Flip flops on my feet and Catch me on the beach watching the sunset every evening I give to you from me I'm guilty This Santa Claus don't need no chimney 12 days with the family is simply Unbelievable what can I say the rest is history mama in the kitchen up a farm everybody cooking up a storm just letting you know that is the norm always keep the christmas vibe warm it's good to be home the lights are on the trees. The presents are open. I'm with the family.
