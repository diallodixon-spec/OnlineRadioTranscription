============================================================

picture on my mirror. Start to blush when somebody says your name. In my stomach, there's a pain. See you walk in my direction, I go the other way. I start to stutter when I speak. Try to stand, but my knees go weak. What's happening to me? In the dark, can you tell me what it means? I lay my head on my pillow, staring out the window. I'm a star for a sign, the reason why You're always in my mind, when you come around I get shy When I see you, when I see you Never know when you might walk by, so I gotta be right on time When I see you When I see you I scribble X and O's in my notebook Checking how my hair and my nails look I feel myself in the zone I get nervous when you call So I say I'm not home I see your face And I hear my favorite song
