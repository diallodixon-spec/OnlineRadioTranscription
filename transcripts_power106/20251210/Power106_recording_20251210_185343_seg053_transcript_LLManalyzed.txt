============================================================

who practice Jiu-Jitsu would want to have a platform of some sort to show what they've practiced or even test what they have learned throughout the years. And we decided to add it. This is now our second year of adding it onto the portfolio to have as an event for participants to come and test their skills within that discipline. So the whole event came off lovely. We got a lot of support from corporate and from our community members. And we really appreciate the support that we've been getting and we are continuing to make it bigger and better. Come next year, I'm thinking that we want to bring some persons from the Caribbean to Jamaica to participate in that next event that we are planning on having in the coming year.
