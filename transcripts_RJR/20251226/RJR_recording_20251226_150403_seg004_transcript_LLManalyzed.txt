20251226 150403 I will do anything just for you Make you feel happy and I'll never make you go I will do any anything just for you Sacrifice my love, I can do anything for you Did you see me walking out and something must be wrong I will never do you that, trust me no more Oh, yeah. The feelings are so strong I hope the feeling's neutral Ever since from above you've been pure and natural There's no other way to describe you
