pleasant morning everyone it's another day beautiful day it is when I come in I felt the December breeze it's so good it's so good to be alive it's good to be able to experience that and today I know it's a wonderful day why it's my mother's birthday. And I want to say happy birthday to you, mother, Mrs. Hathilder Clark Ricketts. Blessed day to you. I know that you are enjoying the day. I know you're up and busy and all over the place, but I want you to just reflect on the goodness of God today.
