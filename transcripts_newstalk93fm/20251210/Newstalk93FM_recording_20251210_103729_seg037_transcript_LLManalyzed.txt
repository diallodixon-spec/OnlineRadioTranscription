I need my buckle. I need my buckle I said send up some praise to God to the man right at the start. The police didn't come on and said boy, God is to be praised. I said no, I don't know. Somebody called up here and one of the men stopped as well because they saw a man holding the person in away and then stop and come on a man said call the police because and him have the little girl and everybody all the way they were trying to call the police because the police were just up there as I told you I'm just keep her in another car you know When I see her parents come, I tell them I would only feel better if I could have put her in her mother's hand. Honestly, eventually the police said to bring her home, let me make sure she gets medical attention.
