20251212 164118 I can't believe Sivir.O.C.T. Coming down from set, sitting on leave Feeling like cock all eyes on me First bandana in them trees Please, I'll stick back and reverse the key Some say callous, some say Kali Twelve years down and I'm finally free It's Drizzy Drake and you're locked into my homeboy chocolate chain. That's it! That's it! All three days are over!
