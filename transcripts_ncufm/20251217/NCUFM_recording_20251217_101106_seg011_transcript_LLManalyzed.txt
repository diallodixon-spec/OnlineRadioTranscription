20251217 101106 Lord, please, Lord, please. Hear my heart's cry. I'm desperately waiting. Just to be where you are. Just say I'll travel near or far. Now raise it up and sing. For your glory. I will do anything just to see you. To behold you at my gate. For your glory, I will do anything. Oh, yes, I will, because I want you.
