============================================================

You always win a real one even though we ain't making it to forever Probably ain't getting back together But that don't mean that I can't wish you better We ain't good, good, but we still good I realize that I can't be your lover Let's just keep it honest with each other I'll be happy for you when you find another We ain't good good good, but we still good My feelings, so deep in my feelings No, this ain't really like me Can't control my anxiety Feeling like I'm touching the ceiling
