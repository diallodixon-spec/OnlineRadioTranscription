2025-12-12 10:09:15 Mondays are the best days of the week, but for Carl over there in North Carolina, it is a regular Wednesday. That's when we promote positivity. Think of yourself, Carl. Yeah, that's Mama Bee's favorite day as well. We got Nivea sending love to her bestie Dimples over there in Brooklyn, New York. Hear that? Hear that, Dimples? Yeah, man. Receive love from your best friend, Nivea. That is it. Hey, shout-outs to Brian. Got it locked in over there in Costa Rica. Yeah, man, think of yourself, Brian Strait, Angie on Down One Road. Hey, how this? Hey, hey, hey, hey. I'm not going to go big up, you know, because I'm still vexed here now.
