His shop was filled with clocks of every size, grand clocks that chimed loudly, tiny pocket watches that ticked softly, and even broken clocks waiting to be repaired. On New Year's Eve, the villagers would gather in his shop because at midnight the clockmaker would reveal a special clock that no one had ever seen before. One year, a young woman named Clara asked the clockmaker, why do you keep so many broken clocks? They don't tell time anymore.
