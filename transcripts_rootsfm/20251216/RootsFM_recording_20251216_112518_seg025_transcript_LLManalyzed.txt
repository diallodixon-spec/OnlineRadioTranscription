20251216 112518 Let's do this. 25 minutes after the hour of 11 o'clock, it is Roots FM 96. Hey, all I want for Christmas is to stay alive. Can't tell you how old I'm, I'm 45. All I want is for Christmas to stay alive. Health and strength, more life. Tired of my bread and my sister, my quarrel. Hey, come make me drink liquor sorrel. Tell Auntie Joan and Uncle Warren send clothes and groceries, no gun, no barrel. No nose, no Santa, no nuggie for carry. And my old stop can't manage. I fill up my mama all when she not have it. She give me a little chocolate tea, a little porridge. Holiday time, my school done. And nothing we need for your fun. It's like a family reunion.
