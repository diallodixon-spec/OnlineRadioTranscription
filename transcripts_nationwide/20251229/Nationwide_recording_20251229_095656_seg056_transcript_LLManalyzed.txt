20251229 095656 the time but there are two quick questions I have to get in. The person who was asking um about uh spouse uh filing um and the the priority well she said she she started the file in October twenty twenty-three. She says she is a green card holder. Each time I check my online account, it says there are no current updates um and she's asking who to contact or where. Contacts. Contacts. Let me log in and see what's going on. Alright, there we go. And the final question before I allow you to give her contact information, somebody's asking if if one has a child in the US, the child was born in the US and the child now lives in Jamaica, having to reenter the US in two years, will that will there be a problem if the child goes back to the U.S.? No, that child is already a U.S. citizen, that child should have a U.S passport, and yes, that child could reenter whenever. All right, thank you so much for that. That's where we're going to have to leave it this morning. Going to allow you ladies now to give your contact information, Opal and then Nadine. Thank you.
