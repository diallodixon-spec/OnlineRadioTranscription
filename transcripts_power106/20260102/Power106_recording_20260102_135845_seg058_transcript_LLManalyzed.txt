20260102 135845 I will argue with them and argue my point, and sometimes you'll hear me sound as if I'm agitated, and not really. Sometimes I play devil advocate in order to take a discussion along. Sometimes I object to his point of view or somebody's point of view, but you see when this mic turns off, trust me, my blood pressure remains the same. As it will do now because it is time to turn off the mic for this week. Thanks to our producer and technical engineer today, Davin Thomas. Thanks to you for being with us. Hopefully we'll do it all again next week if everything is good and wonderful. Both sides of the story coming up next. See you next week. Have a great weekend.
