20251216 134836 I listened keenly to the extended discussion with your guest who has been engaged in the business of teaching people to drive. Frankly, I think it was more of a business promotion blitz for that sector. For there are numerous circumstances that force persons to drive the way they do, including respect for safety and life, quick response to cases of emergency, deplorable road maintenance conditions, corruption among others. One hardly mentioned or sufficiently exposed the economic pressure on attendant social consequences, that is exorbitant interest rates imposed by financial institutions on loans for the transportation industry. There are recipes for throwing caution to the wind. Another is the low literacy rate of the population, fixed literacy rate, curb the propensity of absorbed interest rates in the financial sector and corruption in the public sector, maintain roads, network better and of course that will reduce the carnage on the road. Good one, good one.
