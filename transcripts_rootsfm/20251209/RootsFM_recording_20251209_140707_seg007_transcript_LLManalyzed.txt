There's so much, so much that you just don't see. But if you'd only take the time, I knew in my heart you'd fall. Oh, girl, let's give some time. We don't always run. Can't you see the hurt in me? Life is so hard to learn. I wanna run to you. I want to run up to you. Won't you hold me in your arms And keep me safe from war I ain't wanna run to you Ooh, ooh But if I call my tear Ooh, ooh Share me with you
