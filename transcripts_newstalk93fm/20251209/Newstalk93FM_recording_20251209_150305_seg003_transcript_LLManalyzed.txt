Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You got to free yourself when you hear the freedom bell And nobody in here could brace you You could enjoy yourself when you feel the passion swell I tell ya, I've fallen outside since we have it Sweet woman, we have it Greatest on the planet, boy Suck for the radio love, playin' a song and it goes in the fuck And if I lose myself inside this place, well I show my shit off If this hookah unblast when it be just past the madness, what's up?
