20260101 162019 I had to navigate. Throughout my studies, I faced separation. I can recall one day I was writing my final paper and I went to the mailbox. I received a document from the lawyer, separation documents. Then I started receiving divorce documents. And through all of this, I was studying. But you know what? God kept me busy. So even though I was battling the health when the pain came, because there were so many things, so many constant distractions, stress, I totally forgot. I totally had to put the pain aside and focus. And so I thank God for taking me through 2025 because I know that on my own I could not have made it. There were many days where I had to cry out to him. I had to beg, ball out to him.
