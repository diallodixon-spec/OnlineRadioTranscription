20251222 124929 another day NMC charged late payment fee um it goes on to say okay i provided some information um but remember you know cheque is a promise to pay it is all right while cheque is a negotiable instrument it is indeed a still a promise to pay so if you have a timeline then it's important that you don't do it by cheque. You should maybe do it by, what do you call it? You can do online transfer or suspicious, that can work like that. But once a promise is made, not an actual payment, you have a cheque. So I think that is what is confusing a bit. So if the system doesn't receive it, it's going to record it as late and the late payment reach out. All right? See, this one says, peace and confidence of the season. Grandpa or granddad.
