20251216 142117 Cause I've reached out for you And the thunder is crashing up above You've given me your love And you smile like the sun That shines through the pain That's why I'll be there When the storm rises up When the shadows descend Every beat of my heart Every day without end I will stand like a rock I will vent till I'm red If that's what it takes I will risk everything I will fight, I will be I will lay down my life If that's what you need Every second I live That's the promise I make Baby that's what I give If that's what it is
