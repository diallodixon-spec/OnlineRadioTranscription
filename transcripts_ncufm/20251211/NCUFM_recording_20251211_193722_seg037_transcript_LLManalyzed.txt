2025-12-12 12:32:21 Lord, I know I gave my word that I'd help serve food this weekend, but I just got two tickets for front row seats at the big game this Saturday. What do you want me to do? Show me your will. Okay, heads, I go to the game. Now, Lord, you provided these tickets, so to be absolutely sure, tails, I go the game. Okay, I'll serve food if the phone rings within the next... Two seconds. Often our struggle with God's will is not so much in knowing what he wants us to do, but in being willing to do it. Okay, Lord, I know I gave my word to help serve, so if you want me to not use these valuable tickets and miss my opportunity to go to the big game, then let a herd of elephants run through my front room.
