20251212 120607 I would never tell a lie to you Cause I believe in the truth And I just wanna live good I don't want no dirty secrets fighting me and you Boy facing I'll be your sunlight when it's raining. Stay together and we go in places. I'll be by your side no matter the case. We have a one-way ticket to greatness.
