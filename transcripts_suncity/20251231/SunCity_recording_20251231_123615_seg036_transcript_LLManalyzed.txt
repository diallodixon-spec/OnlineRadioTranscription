20251231 123615 The blood bank is always in need of blood. Give generously. The blood you give today may save your life tomorrow. Now the news. Commissioner of Police, Dr. Kevin Blake, says Jamaica has recorded 649 murders up to December 20, a 43% reduction when compared to the same period in 2024. This represents 487 fewer murders. Dr. Blake has welcomed the substantial decline, noting that hundreds of lives were saved and violent crime significantly reduced. This is not a marginal improvement. It is a substantial reduction and it reflects the cumulative impact of intelligence-led policing focused operations against gangs.
