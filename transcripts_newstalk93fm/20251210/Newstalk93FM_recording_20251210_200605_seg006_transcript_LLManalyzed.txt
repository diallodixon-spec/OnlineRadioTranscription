We break with each other. Come and taste our freedom, sweetie. When you want your ways, look how you have in the places. Hot and groovy. Look what music does to me. It's happy in a jam again. Feel like a movie. When you throw it back on me, I feel no stress again We are the Jump Town Jammin'. We are the Jump Down Jammin' We are the Jump Jump Jammin'.
