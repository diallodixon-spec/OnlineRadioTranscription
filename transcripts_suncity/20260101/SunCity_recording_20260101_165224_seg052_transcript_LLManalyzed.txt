20260101 165224 at 5 to 1, 10 to 1 for his data fact, and Wall Street Traders at 18 to 1. The two horses that stand out in this race, of course, the public has seen it, and it's logical. Number one, Digital One, and number six, Offer Revolution. These two are the top, they have the best times, essentially. But there's a horse in here, number five, interesting times ahead. He's rounding back rounding back into form one a mile race last time and I think the weight breaking is in his favor if he comes off the turn within three lengths of the leaders he's going to be the only one that can run down these two speedballs either digital one or interesting revolution but they have the advantage digital one interesting of revolution, but watch out for interesting times ahead. We have a line.
