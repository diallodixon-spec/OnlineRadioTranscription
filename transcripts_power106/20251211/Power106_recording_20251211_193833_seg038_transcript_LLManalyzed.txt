2025-12-11 21:10:47 So it goes to show what happens at the meet like this. So the 3,000 meters for boys and the 5,000 for boys and the 3,000 for girls are staged at the event and certainly some of the top contenders have participated and will also participate in the meet this year. Can don't know if I have the numbers in terms of breakdown between the males and females that have entered, but one of the things that we've seen this year from the entries, which is the investing mechanic, Bennett, is that normally the largest number of entries would be seen in the shorter distances, in 150 inches.
