Yes, sir. Well. I thought I would have seen you in Litchfield last Friday. Well, I wanted to go but I could not afford to. I'm very broke at this moment. You couldn't afford to get, where are you in relation to Litchfield? I'm in Allside District Ward sub P O Trelawney. And how far is that away from where we were? Well, it's not very far away. It's not far away, but I just could not afford to move. Okay. You know, to be honest. Okay. Yes, but what I have called to start with is that heaven listens to nationwide. And nationwide is Jamaica's pride. And today is the Lord's Day. Namaste to you. The weed that was found in King Solomon's grave is mine.
