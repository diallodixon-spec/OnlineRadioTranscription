2025-12-12 13:10:01 You was hurting deep inside and you was broken But I was on the other side and didn't notice I won't waste no time I won't waste my time when it comes to you Put my pride aside, give it all to you Oh I be down to risk it all if you ask me to. Ain't playin' with your heart cause that's true. You puttin' up a wall but you ain't. I done got it out the mud and got nothing to prove. Tryna open up your mind and see a clearer view.
