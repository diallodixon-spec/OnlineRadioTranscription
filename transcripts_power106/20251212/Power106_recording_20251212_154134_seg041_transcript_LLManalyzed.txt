Is that partnership unique to your intervention and assistance to victims of Hurricane Melissa? Is it unique to that or has this partnership existed before that? especially for this particular initiative to get to our customers, because we still have some customers that identify themselves as J&J customers, and of course we have the BCIC customers, so we're there for both sets of customers, albeit we're one group, we're one company now.
