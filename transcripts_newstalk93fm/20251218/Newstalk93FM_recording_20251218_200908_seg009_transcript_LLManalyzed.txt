20251218 200908 We are the greatest on the planet, boy. Somebody radio loud, playin' a song, and it goes and I fuck. And if I lose myself inside this place, well I show my shit up. If this hoes got unblast when the bitches pass the madness, what's up? Just give me one more shot inside my glass and watch me level up. Fitting like a hero. Call me a hero. Oh, yeah, oh, oh Petting like a hero Oh, yo, yo, yo Call me hero Soon as I reach the dance Bad vibes on zero
