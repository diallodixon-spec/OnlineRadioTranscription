20251226 113525 She's glad it found her Heaven must have made her just for me When she smiles so warm and tender A sight for sore eyes to see Ain't no woman like the one I've got A woman only don't come back tired To make her happy doesn't take a lot You don't ask for things with no boundaries She can feel me up when it's down, I'm goin' Put a little music in my day Wouldn't be surprised if my love keeps growing Bigger every minute that she stays away I would kiss the ground she walks on
