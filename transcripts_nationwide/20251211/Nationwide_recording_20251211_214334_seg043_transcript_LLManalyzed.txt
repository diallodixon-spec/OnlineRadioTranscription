2025-12-11 21:59:54 In a report to Parliament, Fiscal Commissioner Courtney Williams says the necessary threshold for suspension has been met. Dana Davey tells us more. Hurricane Melissa made landfall on October 28, 2025. It's widely considered one of the most destructive in the nation's history, with extensive damage concentrated in western parishes. Preliminary assessments place the physical damage at almost $9 billion, that's equivalent to roughly 41% of Jamaica's GDP. The scale of destruction surpassed the legal threshold outlined in the Financial Administration and Audit Act. The FAA Act permits a temporary suspension of fiscal rules when a natural disaster results in an impact of at least 1.5% of GDP. Following the government's official disaster declaration, the Minister of Finance and the Public Service sought the IFC's determination on whether the statutory conditions had been met. The IFC is Jamaica's independent fiscal watchdog.
