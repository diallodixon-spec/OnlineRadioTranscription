20251222 141714 Blessings come forth, blessings come forth. Yo, it is a miracle we make you ting shot and not end up a gun caught. End up a gun caught growing up on the banks of the Huff. Never give up and we never lose hope and we never sell out and never sell dope. No, ironically, everything what we say, they say is dope. Listen, it never break the spirit growing up broke. Rule out spending like carbon leaks off, yes. A regular regular we run boat just to stay afloat And we run joke just to cope There was no social mobility, limited scope But mamma make me know it's time longer than rope We not frightened for nothing cause we used to go without Fram food, stamp or no stamp, fill up with passport Here was juvenile, no putting a gun in your transport Fick a lick, no banknote, no that at the rank spot Everybody want a bus like public transport But all the fault, everything curry like gold Push a first and second and third Watch your blessings come out, blessings come out Yo it is a miracle we make you think shat and nothing about it
