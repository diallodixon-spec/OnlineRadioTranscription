============================================================

I was driving on Anderson Drive and I saw a little girl missing from the school. It kind of changed the mood in the car. And then we reached Anderson Drive and we saw a little traffic and it looked like a police. When we looked, we saw a police and asked if it was the little girl you're looking for? The police say yes, and we continue driving. When we reach out of the bridge, go under the bridge now, turn from Bustamante Highway, we see one little girl in a blue uniform with one man, and we see the man has stopped the vehicle. So he said, you know, at the uniform that I said, send me the picture of the little girl. He said, it's in our community group, in our community group. When he send me my zoom in, I said, Babes turn back, turn back my pussy.
