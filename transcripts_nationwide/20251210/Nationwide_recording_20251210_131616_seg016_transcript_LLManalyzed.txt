============================================================

We don't talk anymore Like we used to do I just heard you found the one you've been looking You've been looking for I wish I would've known that wasn't me Cause even after all this time I still wonder Why I can't move on Just the way you did so easily Don't wanna know What kind of dress you're wearing tonight Please hold on until you're so tight, the way I did before I overdosed, shouldn't know your love was a game Now I can't get you out of my brain, oh it's such a shame
