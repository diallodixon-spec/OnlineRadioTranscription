============================================================

Looks like we're making up for lost time Need you to spell it out for me Bossing over on an all night It's like a type of alchemy Introduce me to your best friend I can come to slot right in A satellite ain't even that far I kinda wonder where you are Already know I can't leave it alone You're on my mind Already gave you the time and the place, so don't be shy. Just come be the man I need. Tell me you got something to give, I want it. I kind of like it when you call me wonderful.
