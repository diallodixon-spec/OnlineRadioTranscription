Welcome back soon, dear pastor. Let me take this call. Pastor? How are you? All right. Did you go to Peggy's funeral? If I went where? No, I'm asking if you went to Peggy's funerals. Peggy, your friend Nathan, did you go to her funeral? I did not know Peggy had died. Yeah, Peggy died about a month now and buried. Anyhow, I call about that.
