You know what, there was a gentleman and our brother that made a comment about how we're selling our people and I've been hearing this a lot and I want to learn with some love here and I'm going to spoon feed. I'm not no historian, I'm not no well-educated individual, the planet is my teacher. But let me just spoon feed people this, because I really need people to stop using the Western narrative about Africans selling African. Let me break it down. If Rima and Tivoli in a war and some Shaka found Rima get caught in a Tivoli, yes, if you get more weapon, we are going to sell the people in Farima. We are going to sell them, see, and get weapons, ammunition, sustenance from the manipulating Europeans. Then they put a side line on what you know.
