20251226 184427 You come alive with one wine, baby With you, I want to dance the night away One jam, turn a lifetime, baby So don't feel away You don't like the fast life Look on the bright side, girl I go take the blame I just want you come and bite the top Just a little winding up Come and meet me behind the truck and we rev it up Whole day, keep throwing it back at the way you stop Baby no way, we could post up all the pictures you want When you're ready, I go over here, darling. You go over there. But we compete in the middle and start a bacchanal. Play in the middle, hey. What we gonna do now? Jam to a rhythm in the heat. I can't eval, but in the heat, hey, what we gonna do now. Start a wine on it. I say compromise on it.
