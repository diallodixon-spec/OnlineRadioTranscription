And she stepped on off the train Yesterday in the pouring rain With her clothes all packed, her face messed up I could tell she was feeling pain I thought I had something sweet to tell her. As I opened up my umbrella, she was so confused, scared and abused, tried to hide it with a smile. And just like the night in China, I used my charm just to calm her, engage her in a good conversation, just trying to ease her the frustration Have she told me her story? I told her, baby, no worries I'm the man that you're looking for Baby, count your lucky stars Cause I'm taking you home with me tonight
