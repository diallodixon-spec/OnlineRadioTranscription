============================================================

Praises ends in victory for you and for me One day an angry crowd, they crucify this king who wore the crown And they gladly watch my champion going down But I will never count enough for I'm written a song The day you rose to attain the title Champion of love And you find that the hardest Said he's greater than the great No one could ever take His crown away For He's more mighty than the mightiest He reigns from above
