And Seema, talk about the preparation now, going into this now, because I get a sense that they are showing some talent here for this type of activity. How much practice will you be able to get in before the tournament actually started? How many hours? Practice. How many hours of practice? You know, we didn't have much because at first we started out once per week on a Saturday. And then as the time drawn nears, we include another day, a Wednesday afternoon. So on a Saturday morning, we start at 10 and we finish like 12. So that is two hours. And on Wednesday, it's approximately one and a half hours. 3.30 and by 4.30, we are home because it's getting dark and we don't have any light on the court, so we have to move out by 4.30. It's great to see that things are happening.
