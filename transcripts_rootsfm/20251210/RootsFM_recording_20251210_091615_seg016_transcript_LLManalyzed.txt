of the activities going on at Blessed Assurance, and there's so much to do and so on. But we are thankful that you were able to take the time out to share with us today. You know, the parish of St. James has suffered tremendous damage, to say the least, due to the passage of Hurricane Melissa. And Blessed Assurance was not spared. Blessed Assurance is located, of course, in the parish. But could you share, first of all, quickly, how many residents do you have there, first of all? Thank you again. As you mentioned, my name is Deacon Dalmas. I'm the Assistant Administrator of Blessed Assurance. That is one of our children's home in St. James, Massasin communities. The home we have currently 33 children with various disabilities and we also have about 35 staff.
