20260102 215735 What the hell the police can do? What the hell they can do? What they can do? Roses are red and violets are blue Sugar is sweet but not as sweet as you Nothing in this world is what I do with you Want to go shopping, money me give you Want to pay the school, pay money me give you I will make you happy, I will never make you blue. But what the hell the police can do? What the hell the Police can do? I swear if you love me, you'll say I do. Leave the baby and come out in the night too. When you leave me, I don't know what to do. I'll do just to comfort you I will never ever turn my back on you Just remember Dr. Koppelmeck too This is all about faith, don't blame me too But what the hell the police can do? What the hell can the police do?
