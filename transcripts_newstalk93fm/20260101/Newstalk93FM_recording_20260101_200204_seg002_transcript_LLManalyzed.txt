20260101 200204 I tell you I love whenever you bring a vibe with your hands them up in the sky Watch we drunk and having a time Cannibal time again And we have all money to spend And we go right down to the end Watch me with me cannibal friend Them, them me cannibal friend, friend, friend. Now me cannibal, friend friend, friend friend. Now me carnival friend, until we meet up again. Until we meet up again, meet, meet, meet. Rumble beats, beat, beat, beat. Things so sweet, sweet, sweet.
