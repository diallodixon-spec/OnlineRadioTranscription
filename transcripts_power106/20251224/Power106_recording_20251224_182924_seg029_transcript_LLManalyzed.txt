20251224 182924 For 2025, going into 2026, we are well underway already, even though the period has not yet fallen due. Our financials are already with the auditors and are being kept up to date. And by early next year, our audited financials for 2025 will be available. So the financial stability and foundation and strong administrative governance processes are some of the key things, including juniors concentrating on our younger players, women's chess concentrating on our young girls and our female players, and our coaching platforms so that the players get regular coaching from good coaches, local and international, and also many great opportunities to travel and play. Mr Ian Wilkinson KC, President of the Jamaica Chess Federation. Thank you very much sir for being here, very informative and we certainly enjoyed the conversation and you have an invitation to join us here.
