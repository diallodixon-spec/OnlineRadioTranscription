20260101 131713 Pretty feathers in disguise Back together we will rise So don't you ever Let me down again Cause I'm depending on you So you better come through this time Please hear my cry And if I ever Let you down my friend It was a misunderstanding So if I took it for granted You're not promised from today I go drunk like I never drunk We're in like I never went blind Like I never went before Just to show you I saw you, I saw you And I need you back in my life You got people by the truck Emotions running high We are not in the sky Tears running down we eye Can't you tell that we sorry We sorry And we need you back in we lie I need you back on my mind
