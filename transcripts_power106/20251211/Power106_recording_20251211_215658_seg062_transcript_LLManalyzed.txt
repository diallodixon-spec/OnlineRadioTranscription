When the rain has fallen, the water comes down. And eventually I find this hurricane and mash up the whole of the gully down there so we don't even have no road down there. And he must say, he must say I'm going to take the picture and bring that in and eat. And if I didn't know, I wouldn't have been telling Bridget when I went over there. Take all that picture there, and owe him to tell me to do it. And what have you done? That's out of the reach, where nobody can go listen and grapple on them something and go out of place to go fix up that. Don't cost too much money and time on them something, you know, makes sense. You understand, sir? It seems like tomorrow I'll go back down to go talk with him and make him know, sir. It doesn't seem like I'm going to take up the load, you know. Too much things attached around it, you know. The farm is not so well. When I get the load, I can do everything one time and get the money I carry, you know. What he's saying what.
