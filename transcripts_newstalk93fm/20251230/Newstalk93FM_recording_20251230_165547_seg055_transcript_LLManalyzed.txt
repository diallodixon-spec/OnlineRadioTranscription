20251230 165547 beach cleanup activity, transforming environmental stewardship into hands-on actionable action. Nestled along the coastline of the small fishing village of Robbins Bay, the school overlooks what Grade 6 teacher Alicia Wiley describes as a perfect view of the beach. Now, with the sea just steps away from their daily view, she says educating students about the environment and the importance of protecting it is not optional, but necessary. It is our duty as Jamaicans, everyone needs to be involved in keeping the environment clean, especially in light of climate change and other environmental challenges that we have. So everyone must participate to ensure that we have a better future in our country. This is something that we would definitely like to participate in. We have been in it for the past three years and we are very happy to be included in this initiative.
