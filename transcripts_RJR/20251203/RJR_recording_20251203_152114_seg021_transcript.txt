============================================================

I would have lost anything I wanted. I was nothing to you. I was crazy about you. I was just thinking I was kind of special. You were running round the head and every other girl was out. Could you love me when you knew you planned it for me? You knew that you were wrong. Dead wrong to be mistreating me. How can we go home? I work for you. I'm just about you. I can't take you home, can't take you no more. I've had enough of you. I'd rather be on my own, yes, on my own. Same old days, they're not a work of you.
