20260102 185738 If I say that I could be your one and only Promise you'll never leave me lonely I just want to be the one you need But I just wanna be the one to serve you Sometimes I feel as if I don't deserve you I'll cherish every moment we share And if I don't deserve you. I'll cherish every moment we share. And if I am in love again, I will be sure that the lady is my friend. And if I'm in love, so true, I will make sure that the lead is just like you. Oh, hey, no very first time.
