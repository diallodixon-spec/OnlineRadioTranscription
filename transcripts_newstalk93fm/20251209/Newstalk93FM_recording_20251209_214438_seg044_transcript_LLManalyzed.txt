Lyons in the place, it's a bambam Women start whining, it's a bam-bam And she a make up her face, it's a bomb-bam Still up on her mic, it's a bom-bam DJs make in the place, its a bomb-bom Women start whine, it's a bombs-bomb And she a make-up her face, its a bombs-bom Still up on the mic, its a bom-bom You better tell, I'll treat you well, I. It's good I can tell, come give me hell, come here. Your favorite tale under your spell, I am. She gets your nail, I'll wear it all. I guess I done ran out of options. Can't keep fantasizing. I'm calling you so we can lock in But you call me toxic You make it easy for me to believe in your lovin' You better believe it cause maybe I'm livin' with somethin' Cause it's better than the dick you had before
