So it's very important that we connect with them outside of just providing them with the service to give back to them to say, hey, we're here with you and we will be here until we would have recovered from this category five, which may take many months. And even after that, the ministry and its agencies will be here to assist our farmers. Beautiful. Well, congratulations on a lovely Christmas village. Thank you very much for the work that you do in our agricultural sectors, supporting our farmers in a great way. And we thank you for partnering with us, continuing the partnership with us on Paul 106 FM. Thanks, Christine. Thank you too. Have a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year when it comes. See you on your Christmas. Alright, good. All the very best to you and yours. Christine Forbes there, Public Relations Specialist with the National Irrigation Commission Limited. What a great way to bring down the curtain on our broadcast from this, the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Mining's Christmas Village. As we go, a big thank you to our production
