20251229 174230 Life it's a journey, it's a long race Mama says son be wise and don't bring disgrace So me take up the broom and start sweep the place Cause all these ways they got to get erased A love to me people that me embrace The truth of the truth and that can't erase So hell to all of those who want hate just send me to finish this race so we ain't giving up now we put up a fight we got to be ready. So we pray. We pray, we pray, we pray.
