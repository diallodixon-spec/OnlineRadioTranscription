Be very careful about, because some of these items are electrical items, including things like charging pads and all kinds of things, over half a million. So you need to be conscious of that when you're purchasing. Drop the things in your cart and then go back and do your search to find out if these things have been recalled, the brand, the item, and so on. Amazon has done a good job of listing these things. Descriptors are there to help you. So please, check before you purchase. That's online. And make sure that you're in the proper location, the search site, the website, directly.
