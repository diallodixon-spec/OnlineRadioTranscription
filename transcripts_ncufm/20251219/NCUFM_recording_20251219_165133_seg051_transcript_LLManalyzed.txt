20251219 165133 I wonder do I got any brothers that will lift up their hands and cry with a loud voice. My steps are ordered. Sisters, can you say ordered? You've got to stay right there in the furnace. You know exactly what you've been going through. Won't you know? Through the fire, through the blood When life takes you through the winding door Now everybody under the sound of my voice You need to know, you need to know Can you see or not? You're just so right. When you're crying in the middle of the day. Now somebody just lift your hands and praise him. Praise him.
