============================================================

I'm in the building and they're watching I know this I'm rocking I'm rolling I'm holding I know it, you know it You know I know how To make them stop and stare as I fall now The clock can't even handle me right now Watching you, watching me, I go all out The clock can even handle me right now The club can't handle me right now Where have you been all my life? Where have you been, all my life?
