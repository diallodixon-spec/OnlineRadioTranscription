Come throw your hands up in the air. Celebration. Wave with me, wave with me. Come out and wave with me. You can spend the day with me. Wave with me, wave with me Come out and wave with me, come out and rave with me You can spend the day with me Wave with me, Wave with me, Come out and Wave with me Come Out and Rave with me Sky blue and sun is bright All's well and all is right Why don't you come outside? We're waiting, just come and vibe Arms spread spread both long and wide. Heart warm like fireside. With more love than valentines. It's waiting. Take all of mine. Pass me one B and O. Girls, let them hear down. Go fast or hear down. We do this all year round. Look left and look right. Now you'll see what we've got.
