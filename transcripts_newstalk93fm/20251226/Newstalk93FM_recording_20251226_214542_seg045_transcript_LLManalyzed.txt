Rockin' around the Christmas tree, let the Christmas spirit ring Later we'll have some pumpkin pie and we'll do some caroling You will get a sentimental feeling when you hear Our voices ringing. Let's be jolly. Deck the halls with boughs of holly. We're rocking around the Christmas tree. Have a happy holiday. Everyone dancing.
