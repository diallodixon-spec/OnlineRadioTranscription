20251216 181410 Hey, can we talk some business? You know, I want your company. And it's nothing too risky. Limited liability. Don't worry. If you try all the things I like, you could still be shy in the morning. So don't't feel away You don't like the fast life But look on the bright side, girl I go take the blame I just want you come and rise it up Just a little ride and I'll say Come and meet me behind the truck and we rev it up Say hold it hold it. Keep throwing it back. I know why you stopped us. Baby, no way. We could post up all the pictures you want when you're ready. I could overshare, darling. You could overshare. But we could meet in the middle and start a bacchanal.
