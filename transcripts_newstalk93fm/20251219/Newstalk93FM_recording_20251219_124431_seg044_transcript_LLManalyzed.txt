20251219 124431 It's my life Won't you let an innocent woman be Never hurt or self-care Half your brain just ain't fair Let you out While you always come running Taking all my loving from me My boy's playing hard to get and I like my boys playing hard to get And I like my men all incompetent. And I swear they choose me. I'm not choosing them, amen. Amen. Hey, man. Hey, man! Oh, yeah.
