20251226 105637 Don't be afraid Don't be afraid I'm loving every single thing you do Lord, you give me hope and strength To help me make it through Even when I turn my back on you Lord, you pick me up again You'll always be my friend and just wait I thought that this was it Me lower than the floor Me done, me quit You reach down one more time Say my child never mind, you're my friend
