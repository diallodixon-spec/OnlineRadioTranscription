your natural aspirated car. There are two different animals we're talking about. And so it requires better fueling, better oiling, better coolant, and a quicker interval between services, right? So we have seen persons that neglect their turbocharged engine, especially diesel. They neglect them. Now diesel burns diesel fuel. And as a result of that, even though we're burning low sulfur fuel now, we have a thing called blow-by, meaning no matter what, no matter how good your engine is, there's still some amount of unburned fuel that is going to go past your pistons, and it's going to go into the oil and contaminate that oil. Over time, if you don't change that oil, small particles, acids and so on can build up in that oil and deteriorate things like the shaft in the turbocharger and so on, and so eventually you may have a premature failure of the turbocharger.
