And then you just pin it down and record it. Pin it down and make sure I don't forget it. And then it becomes a hit. Exactly. Praise the Lord. So then what encouragement do you have to give the drive time family, especially the young folks among us? The encouragement I would like to give. First of all, I would encourage them to lean not on their own understanding. But in all their ways, they should acknowledge Christ and he shall direct their path. You know, trust God with their dreams, decisions and future.
