20251218 091609 because when I went last night to drop off my cousin so much people was at the airport coming into Jamaica and you know there's thousands of barrels that come along with them and are shipped overseas and transportation activity intensifies. How can members of the public protect themselves from fraud, theft and unsafe practices? So joining us to address these critical issues are senior superintendent of police Stephanie Lindsay commanding officer in charge of the ports division who will speak on airport and seaport safety and we also have superintendent of police Rochelle McGibbon Scott officer in charge of Newport West police station who will focus on motor insurance motor motor vehicle scams and transportation of barrels during the busy period. Good morning ladies, good morning. Good morning. Good morning to you and your listeners. Thank you, thank you. Welcome, welcome to the Hello Jamaica show. Thank you so
