If I could light the world up for just one day. Watch this madness, to the full charade. No one can be just like me anyway. Just like magic, I'll be flying free I'ma disappear when they come for me I'll keep that ceiling, what you gonna say? No one can be just like me anyway It's just like fire, fire Just cause nobody's done it y'all don't think I can run it but look I've been here I've done it impossible please watch I do it with ease
