Tell the real people to do their best right now Go up on the road, drop that mine now Run up on me, take that money right now Shake, shake, I'm in your friend's mind pow! Don't fuck with me, do not sell, right? Now, we're gonna tell the boss I'm your friend, right? Chop, B.A.B., they just want to help, right? But, but, but, but change them lives, what you did? They're right, huh? Used to be a good life, right? What you did? Well, you know me, don't be more like me. Big love, big love, big love. What you did?
