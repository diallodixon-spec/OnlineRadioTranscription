wheelchairs are the shoes of those who use them. So when a wheelchair is not in place or somebody who uses a wheelchair doesn't have that wheelchair, it becomes a mobility issue. The person is unable now to move around and it makes, if they would require any type of support, it would make it more difficult for them to access it because they don't have the resources to move around. So they therefore lose even more of their independence? More of their independence. Other people have to be filling in and just to try to move adults around, as we all know, can be a bit of a task. Yes. Wow. Okay. And is that necessarily all disabled people? Are you also, does that also include, for instance, elders who may also have mobility issues, not necessarily because of disability, but simply age? It's a mixed number, yes it is. Some persons are clients of the council who would, because of their disability, are utilising a wheelchair.
