She said most times, I'm home alone, so RGR is my company. She said the hotline, the tool live show, the jokes and the laughter and information. There's so much and more beyond the headlines and the programs that follow. RGR is a whole vibe. I remember you were reading it earlier. And she said, how could I forget this on the side? I totally enjoyed the show today. Safe travel home. Thank you, Lady Belle. Thank you. Thank you so much. I want to thank all our guests who made their way here today to make the show such a great show. Sit on a black wood, founder of Zion Restoration. Such a powerful young lady. I don't even think she knows the power that she has yet. But when she steps into her fullness having experienced all that she has. She has experienced so much. Shani we didn't have the time today to go through everything that she's been through and still going through. Still going, still standing. Yeah man Job faith man it's an incredible thing.
