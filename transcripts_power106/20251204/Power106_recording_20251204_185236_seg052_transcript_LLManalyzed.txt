You've been a major player in the hospitality industry. Talk about what this type of achievement is doing for brand Jamaica, Christopher. Well, as I witnessed with Tommy and Senna when they did GT4 last year, they have drivers signing before the actual race and to see the attention they got as you know Jamaican drivers was really special not to mention the car itself with the Jamaican flag colors so again that was why I was so happy to be Senna's teammate, that we could have a car that was similarly branded with Jamaican colors. But I'll tell you, we have actually had guests come to stay at the hotel as a result of our racing overseas.
