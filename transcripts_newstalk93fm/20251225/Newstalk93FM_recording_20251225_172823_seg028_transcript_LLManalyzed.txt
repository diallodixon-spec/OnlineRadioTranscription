Too much ice, I'm a bris That's why everybody hate to know me like Chris Kilo me, kilo me, kilo me I don't come, I don't come kilometers. I don't walk that many kilometers. People think I be journey just come. Like I just got rich, like my money just come. Send them back to where they come from. For talking like the product of a torn condom.
