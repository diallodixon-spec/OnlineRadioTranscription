20251222 113428 We've weathered many storms, and Hurricane Melissa has tested us once again, but the strength of our people is unbreakable. Now it's time to rebuild together. The Government of Jamaica has launched SupportJamaica.gov.jm, the official national platform to coordinate relief, mobilize support, and assist families affected by Hurricane Melissa. Visit supportjamaica.gov.jm and encourage your friends and relatives to do so as well, so that we can all donate securely, submit pledges, or locate nearby shelters. Every act of kindness, every dollar, helps bring hope and healing to our island home. Let's stand together. Let's rebuild stronger. Because when we Jamaicans unite, nothing can break us. Spread the word today.
