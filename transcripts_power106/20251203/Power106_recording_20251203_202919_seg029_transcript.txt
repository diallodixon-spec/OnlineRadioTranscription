What was your last reading? Did you check today? When was the last time you checked? What kind of reading are you getting? A lot of them, especially the men, they say, it's all right, man. And then that's when you engage them a little bit more. And you say, what was the reading? Why, let me check, man, it's good, man, It's all right. It's a response they get. I said, what was the number? What number did you get? And then that's when you realize that they don't really know the numbers. And it's a good opportunity for you to bring them in your confidential room and give them a little talk and just offer to even check it for them and let them see what the numbers look like and explain to them also what those numbers that they're seeing means. You know? And then you can do that little correlation between what the numbers mean and the importance of taking the medication and, you know, just their dietary, I mean, their dietary modification that needs to be done and exercise and all of those.
