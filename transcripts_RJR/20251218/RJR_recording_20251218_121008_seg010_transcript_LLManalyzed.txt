Now, President of the Jamaica Hotel and Tourist Association, Christopher Jarrett, is appealing to Jamaicans to support domestic tourism as part of efforts to aid the sector's economic recovery in the aftermath of Hurricane Melissa. He says domestic tourism has always been a lifeline, pointing out how it helped keep many hotels going during the tough days of the COVID-19 pandemic. Mr. Jarrett adds that there are special rates available to locals at some hotels.
