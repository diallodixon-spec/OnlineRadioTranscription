20251231 203423 Walking, standing tall, but still fall for me You come in with baggage, it's costing me Still don't have it all, but give it all to me Come and turn me on, but go off of me Please say you love me, girl, you end up crazy Face like crazy, man, don't chase me Say you wanna see me, well, you're gonna take me
