Here is a financial literacy tip from your friends at Power 106 FM. Save for retirement now. No matter how young you are, plan for your retirement now. With the power of compound interest, when you start saving in your 20s, you will earn interest not only on the principal you deposit, but also on the interest you earn over time and you will have what you need to retire someday. Company-sponsored retirement plans are a great choice. Not only do you get to put in pre-tax dollars, but many companies will also match part of your contribution, which is free money. If you don't start early, you may end up needing to work much longer to catch up on your retirement savings. Join Jason Downer, parenting consultant and associate forensic psychologist every second and fourth Tuesday at 8 p.m. live and exclusively on Power 106 FM for Raising Boys and the Journey to Manhood. Do you have a son? Are you the guardian for boys?
