20260101 190001 ever the wind may carry us I will never let you go one thing I have to say to you I just love in it and let me gravitate to you give me the compass let me navigate to you fly up and sail on my way to you deep as the ocean your love's flowing into me and even though the waves out from this love wave just love me deep as the blue sea. Your love's flowing into me. And even though the waves are from this love, the waves are deep as the blue sea, deep as the blue see. I said this love is so strong. No, we won't break. No, no, no, no. The love in me is deep as you see. Because love is as deep as can be. Deep as the dark blue, yeah. Kavaka and me. Oh, oh, oh, oh. So accurate. So deep as, baby. So deep as. I said I need your love. One's deeper than you and me. Yeah. DJ Frost, it's another one. Oh. Oh, it's on Frost.
