I will bless the Lord at all times. His praises shall continually be in my mouth. He has forgiven me of all my sins. He has healed all my diseases. He has delivered me from destruction. He has crowned me with love and kindness and has satisfied my needs that my youth is renewed like the eagles. Thank you, Father, for enabling your people to say these things like David. In Psalm 103, we pray and thank you for all the mercies and blessings we ask in Jesus' name. And Father, we continue the conversation with you because we pray now for our children there are so many of our children that are suffering right now many of them are going through some difficult times many of them are hungry many
