20251226 122014 Oh That's when You left me. I died in the rain. That's when you left me. Lord, You brought me through. Now I'm back to You. That's the way You left me. Come here to save. That's when You let me. Lord, you promised me. You would hear my plea and You would hear the words you said. Oh, have your way. You've got me through. No, just promise me.
