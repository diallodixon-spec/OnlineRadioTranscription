Baby, when the bright lights start to fade Fire up your lights, I float on with the waves You make me feel lighter, lighter You make me feel, lighter, lighter Oh God, baby, must get better No one left me, feel I'm only mine Don't go come from No one left me now But that movie must get better Get in on your head, so you start gimme attitude One hand on your friend, tell me You don't know if I true but me know it is just start to flow You really woulda do me that After me tell you say me love you then Come for your dance and we'll split up But me give you everything that we have You really woulda' do me that
