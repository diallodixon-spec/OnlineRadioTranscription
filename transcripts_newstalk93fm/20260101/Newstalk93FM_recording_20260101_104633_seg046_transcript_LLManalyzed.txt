20260101 104633 It feels good to love somebody and somebody loves you back But it feels one sided now It feels one sided now You don't have to return about it cause it's crystal glad now, now. Guess it's bye to the good times. I'll be gone by the sunrise. I'll be better on my own. I'll better on my own, now, now. Nobody should call my phone. Nobody should call, my phone, now. This is my last heartbreak song, this is my last heart break song. I'll be good on my own, I'll be good my own. Why are you so quick to leave, when we both can make it work?
