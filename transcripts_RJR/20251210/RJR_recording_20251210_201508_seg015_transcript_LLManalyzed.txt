It's another Wednesday, day number 10 it is. And so we got just about 15 days getting to Christmas 2025. The streets are busy like trouble. My gosh, every little shortcut. All taken up by traffic, believe you me. You just got to be patient folks, believe you me, that's how it is. In the the meantime some music to take you back as we rock together on a Wednesday right here on the 94 the nightcap on your radio Be mine tonight, give me your love You're all I need Be mine tonight Be mine tonight, touch me again
