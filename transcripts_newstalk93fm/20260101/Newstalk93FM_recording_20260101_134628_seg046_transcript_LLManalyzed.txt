20260101 134628 So you're my fashion. So tell me if you want action. Until the lights back on I got the one we gon' last long I don't even ever know my time Feel like what I waited for lifelong I pull up in my high fashion Every night I shit in any way We can go ahead and just head out And chill up in my villa, take it out the whole night Just get in the drop top, take the head out And cruise with your head outside Go ahead, it's your time baby It's your time baby, get by baby That's the difference when you're my baby That's how it is when you Nobody make me stop the world
