The man who worships silver and gold shall surely, surely, surely lose his own soul, then fade away. One who's always acting smart And don't carry no love in his heart Shall fade away God is here and there and everywhere And he knows when you play the game unfair Some people beware or else you fade away Beware or then you fade away You gotta fade, you gotta fade, gotta fade now
