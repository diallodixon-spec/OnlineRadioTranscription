I've been low, the money no fit in me. You be cold, we dancin' those I. Independently, I'll take the liberty. And I'm gonna love you special. All the love, all the care, them they fake. Don't be hard, baby, give it. I'm gonna love you. All the love, all the care, damn, they fake on me. Don't be hard. Baby, give it. I'm going to love you. I want you to text me. I'll be that text me. But you're going to be hushed up on the back.
