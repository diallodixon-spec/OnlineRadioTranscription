20251218 212923 Yeah, man. I remember when things were so difficult for me, I remember in Kingston I was to give up my apartment and sleep in my shop. But that was sacrifice for a better life. Doing something that others would not do so eventually you cannot have what others won't have. If you don't make sacrifice, you going nowhere in life. And those who have achieved a lot can sit down and tell you where they are coming from, what they had been through, and they have done things that maybe me and you might not have done. That's why they are ahead of the game.
