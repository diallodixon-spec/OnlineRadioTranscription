============================================================

But I don't love you any less I thought you always thought enough of me To always be impressed I may not be a lady But I'm all woman From Monday to Sunday I work my fingers to the bone. I know, classy lady, that I'm one woman. This woman needs a little love to make her strong. You're not the only one.
