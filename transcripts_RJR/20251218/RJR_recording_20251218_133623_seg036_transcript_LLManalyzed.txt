He was one of those rivers that, I don't want to say silent because he make noise, you know. But when I say noise, what I mean is Jimmy Cliff is one of those figures where you would miss him in a room because he would not be the loudest person no but but but very intelligent very intelligent yes um extremely i'd say in touch with his people yes trust me he's an observer but very you hear you hear how descriptive he is in his music yeah i mean you watch him on film that just is one movie when you watch how they come. Nice eh? Just a very honest portrayal of the role. Nice. Beautifully done. Like, like, I don't even, I mean I wonder if some Jamaicans even know this man is an iconic creature. I don't think people understand.
