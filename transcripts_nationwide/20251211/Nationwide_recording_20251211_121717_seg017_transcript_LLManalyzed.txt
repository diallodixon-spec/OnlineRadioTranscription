meet a briefing on Thursday morning. The National Health Fund working with the ministry has adopted the government of Jamaica emergency procurement methodology which has activated repair works at four of the main hospitals in the affected health regions and so we have seen work commenced already in the critical institutions the Black River Hospital, Sablamar Hospital, Noel Holmes Hospital, and Falmouth hospitals. More details will be provided on this in the coming weeks, but the important note here is that we now have work that have commenced in earnest to restore these major institutions, and Cornwall had already started, just to be clear. Dr. Tufton says work will also be done to determine whether three hospitals located in coastal zones may have to be relocated. We are engaging a technical support team through our collaboration with the Inter-American Development Bank.
