2025-12-12 14:54:17 Well, Jingle Bell Rockin' Jingle Bells time and Jingle Bell time Dancin' and dancin' in Jingle Bell Square In the frosty air What a bright time It's the right time To rock the night away Jingle Bell time is a swell time To go gliding in the one-horse sleigh Giddy up, jingle horse, pick up your feet Jingle up around the clock Mix and a-mangle in the jingling feet That's the jingle bell rock Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell run Jingle bell chime in Jingle bell time Jingle bell square in across the earth
