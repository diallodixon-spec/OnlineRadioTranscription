20251230 200703 You still show mercy and keep me safe. Lord, I pray. I honor your name. Deliver your mercy. Whenever I fall, you lift me up. Glory to me. Oh God. All-powerful omnipot. Step in on me life and take precedence. Be the captain, the pilot, the teacher. Be the head and the boss and the leader. Be my guide, me shepherd, and me keeper, beginning and the end, you and the alpha and me. Lord, I pray. I honor your name. Deliver your mercy. Whenever I fall, you lift me up.
