20251225 105336 Whenever you doubt it, I'll be letting you know I want to be dancing with you forever You see through the storm and take me as I am Baby it's magic anytime that we're together I make I just love you and hold you for my hand Hold you for my hand It's time to go home. It feels like time is frozen and night is for us. And we're alone again, every moment stolen, yeah. Feelings I've been holding in, it must be love. Whenever I'm broken, you make me feel whole.
