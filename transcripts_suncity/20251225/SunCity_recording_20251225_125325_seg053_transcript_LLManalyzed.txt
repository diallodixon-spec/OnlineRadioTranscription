20251225 125325 Merry Christmas goes on to Andrea. God bless Forbes. Andrea Forbes, big up yourself. There's so much life I've left to live And this fire is burning still When I watch you look at me I think I could find the will To stand for every dream And forsake the sunlit ground and give up this feeling of what would happen if they ever knew I'm in love with you
