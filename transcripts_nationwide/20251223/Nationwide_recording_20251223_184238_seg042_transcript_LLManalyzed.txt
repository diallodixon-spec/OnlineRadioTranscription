20251223 184238 Good evening, listeners. Welcome back. It's time for the nation's business and we continue our year in review. This time we turn to the Major Organized Crime and Anti-Corruption Agency, that's MOCA. And to speak with us about MOCA's year, we will speak with the Director of Communications, Major Basil Jarrett. Good evening Sir Jarrett. Good Evening. Good evening to you too. So please Sir Jarrett, MoCA has the enviable reputation I would say of being one of the most trusted law enforcement agencies in the country and I assume 2025 was no different. How did it end up in this position to this very much respected and trusted position? You know, I think the public approval rating that we currently have is down to just how we conduct our business.
