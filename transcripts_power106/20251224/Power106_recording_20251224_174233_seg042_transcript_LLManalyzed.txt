20251224 174233 with every Christmas card I write may your days, may your days be merry and bright and may all your Christmases be white I'm dreaming of a white Christmas Just like the ones I used to know Where the treetops glisten And children listen to hear sleigh bells in the snow. I'm dreaming of a white Christmas.
