Why are you engaging with the water meter? I said, why are you looking for the water meter? Right. They get a report that it's leaking. I said, from where? The app. They have an app and the app says it's leaking and whatever. And then he shows me the app. I said, right here on my gate. Then he shows me a picture of my gate. What? And I said, National Water Commission sent you a photo of my gate. I said, that's an invasion of my privacy, though. And I'm a really one Clarified Water Commission that them other app that's going to send their own people's gate like you can send the meter if you want to on the ground. Right. I said, but why is my house in this app? I'm not comfortable with that. That's serious. So by the way brother, where your ID or the other contractor down the road is a carer of them and the other two, the ID down the road. I said but you shouldn't come out of the carer without your ID. I said you put yourself at risk. Yes.
