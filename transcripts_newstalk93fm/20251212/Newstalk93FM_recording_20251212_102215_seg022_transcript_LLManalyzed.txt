20251212 102215 Like yourself, like yourself, like yourself Until the party done Boy don't try to run the line And you don't try to stop me vibe so don't say You do what you want, I do what I like You ain't have to get no change When it comes to party, I ain't such a man And I know when we come to party, we don't have a plan You don't tell me, why not who I want you? Why not who you like? We doing me your thing So when you ready, you to try and follow your heart and never wanna follow what I like And it's your kid, so why not everybody inside? Like yourself, like yourself, like yourself Until the party comes, come and do your work Come and do your work, wine and do your life Wine and do your lolly, like yourself
