Welcome back to Cliffhuse Online. Again, I'm holding the ground for the captain of this ship called Nationwide 90FM who's somewhere at an elevated position listening to us. Morning, Cliff. Morning. And the fans, your listeners, your antagonists, they send their love and appreciation, and they're prescribing all sorts of remedies for you to beat the ailment. You know, Cliff, as a town man, Cliff gives countryman vibes, you know? Yeah? But he doesn't know no more country. He's a town man through and through. But he gives off country man vibes. Which is good. Country people are, they represent the best of Jamaica, you know. I love them. Anyway, they story this way.
