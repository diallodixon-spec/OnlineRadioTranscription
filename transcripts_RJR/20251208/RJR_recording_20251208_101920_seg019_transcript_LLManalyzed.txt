Of course, Mr. Finlayson, good to have you. Yes, I am. If you're on speaker, it's rather difficult. Are you on speaker? Oh, that's okay. I think I'm hearing you. All right. So, speaker, performance evaluation process in the public sector, that is a mouthful. So what are PERs and are they important? Hello? I seem to have lost him again. All right, so hopefully we can solve that out. And of course, this is some very critical information he'll be sharing with us this morning, you know. And the critical thing is the public sector, and it has rules, it has regulations, and of course, speaking now about the evaluation. And of course, when you speak about evaluation, the process has to be fair and has to be clear for all involved. So I really hope that we are able to appreciate the importance of this
