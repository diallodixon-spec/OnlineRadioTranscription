I can't imagine who your granddaughter has come in from up there spending the time with you. It is precious. Absolutely precious that is. Believe you me. All right. Thank you so much for calling. You too. Thank you, Mr. Morley. All right, ma'am. All right, good, bye-bye. I tell you, family, you know, I was listening to the news. Heard that side of the news, a child who drowned.
