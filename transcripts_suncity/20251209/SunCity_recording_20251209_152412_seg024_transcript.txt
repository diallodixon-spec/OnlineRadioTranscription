Let me see you light it up, boy. I feel like I can feel the love, boy. Voice is so loud, can't be denied. Across the world, our light still shines. Together we are one people, oh. One people, one country, one country Spreading love everywhere we go Hey, one people, one people One country, one country Hey, spreading love everywhere we go Come to Jamaica, the land of beauty Where life on the beach feels like a movie Take a trip, touch down if you're feeling groovy We'll party every day cause we love to party We will rise above the hardest of the times
