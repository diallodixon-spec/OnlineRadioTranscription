20260101 210303 From eight until eight, I think about you. On my nights, I don't know what to do. I can't get no rest, can't get no sleep. This whole thing got way too deep, and we should stop making a big deal out of the little things Cause I got big deals and I got little things I got everything, I'm asking for what you want Stop making big deal out of little things Let's get carried away Come right now, you know where I stand I just wanna say you're mine, you're mine. Fuck what you heard, you're mine you're mine. All I'm really askin' for is you. You're mine, You're mine. Long as you know who you are.
