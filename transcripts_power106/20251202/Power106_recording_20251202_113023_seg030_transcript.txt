it just it looks mad kill it I am even double-tapping which means when you double-tapped there's no evidence left but at the same time I am pardoning Hernandez and this one they are material against him. How do you explain this one? What do you mean you can't explain man? Explanation is that it is typical of the Trump administration. That's all you have to offer me? Yeah, always pardon people who have been convicted once they are loyal to you. So you're saying he's suffering from some selectivity issue?

So all I have to say is, big up Forbes, and Forbes will give me some money. Yeah man, yeah. Fialty, January 6th, pardon, everybody, everybody pardon, yeah?
