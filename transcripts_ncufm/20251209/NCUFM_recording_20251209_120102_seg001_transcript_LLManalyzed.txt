Waste Management Authority, NSWMA, has confirmed that one of their compactor trucks was involved in an accident this morning along Bonito Crescent in Mandeville, Manchester, resulting in the death of a child. The NSWMA has extended their deepest condolences to the family and says the police are investigating the incident. And finally, government MP Xavier Maine on Monday filed a lawsuit in the Supreme Court targeting the Integrity Commission and three of its senior directors. The application follows an investigation report tabled in parliament last week, which recommended Maine be charged for allegedly failing without reasonable cause to disclose financial information related to companies with which he is associated. And that's it for the news. The weather update is next.
