20260102 115835 and as a nation, seek God's guidance. Gracious God, we desire not to engage this year on our own, in our own wisdom, or without you. Lead us, Heavenly Father, lead us. Over the world's tempestuous sea, guard us, guide us, keep us, feed us, for we have no help but Thee, yet possessing every blessing, if our God, our Father be. Guide us, O Lord, in our personal lives. Help us not to stray from you, but help us to reflect your beauty and your way. Help us to deepen our commitment to you. Be with us in the decisions we shall make.
