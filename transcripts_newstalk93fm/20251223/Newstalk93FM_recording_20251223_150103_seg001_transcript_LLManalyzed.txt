20251223 150103 I love the way that you bring a vibe With your hands them up in the sky Falling down and up in a time Wine in season again And we have the money to spend And we jammin' down to the end Runnin' with me cannibal friend, friend, friend. Oh, yeah. Yeah, I'll be a cannibal friend. Friend, friend, friend, yeah. I'll be cannibal friend until we meet up again. Mm, everything done sat, you know. Mm, the bag done packed, you know. Mmm, she dreaming to take her wife on me. Cause she coming down to please me.
