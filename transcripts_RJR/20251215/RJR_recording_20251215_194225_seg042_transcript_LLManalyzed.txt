20251215 194225 The DBJ sought to identify the gaps regarding access to finance and its ability to support businesses that have a range of impact, from those that were immediately in the path of the storm to those which had indirect exposure based on disruption to supply chains. The framework being pursued by the DBJ has three distinct product windows. The first, we have coined the name the refinance window. These are businesses that might have been indirectly affected, which already have credit facilities. And what we've done is to look at how we can engage in an assessment of terms, relax certain issues that can allow them to continue and have some breathing space. The second is what we refer to as the reboot window. And this is also what we have referenced as a light touch. You may have just some short-term needs, you have inventory to be replaced, you have some infrastructure damage that's not material to your ongoing operations, but you need to get back to where you were pre-storm.
