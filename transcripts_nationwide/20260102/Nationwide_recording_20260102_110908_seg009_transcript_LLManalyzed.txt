When you drive around to the back now, there's a big tent around there, right? Right. There's at least two tents around there where they're used to pre-process. Right, right. That's my recollection yeah i don't remember parking lot no right right and and ricardo because i i went there while i was in jamaica to um yes carlene smith carlene smith on youtube is saying there's no space there and valery says very limited parking yeah right and and and ricardo i i think it is very uncomfortable because when you get there in the morning, I got there like 6 a.m. in the morning and I had to pay a security to open the chain to one of the plazas for me to park in order to go over there.
