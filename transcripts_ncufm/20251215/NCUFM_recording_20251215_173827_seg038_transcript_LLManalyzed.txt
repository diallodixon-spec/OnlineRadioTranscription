Keep at least a two second distance from the vehicle in front to allow reaction time. Now this is something I noticed a lot of drivers have been doing. Driving a bit too close behind the vehicle in front. Anything can happen. Anything can happen causing that vehicle to stop. And you will have less space and time to react to avoid an accident. Something my dad taught me is that if you can't see the two rear wheels of the vehicle in front, you are too close and yeah man that's something I carry with me. Yes you can adopt that as well yeah man I've given you that one I'm giving you that tip. So if there's anybody going about the learners or the license right about now that's a pro tip.
