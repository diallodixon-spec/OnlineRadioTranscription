I'm saying that, bear in mind, you know, it is the same players in the entertainment industry who were the most visible people on the ground very early, cheering and giving. Yes, but that is cheering and giving. That is not eating and drinking and making merry. I'm trying to shut out the others. Let me bring back in the others, but I just want to say, finally, just before I bring them back in, that you spoke of, you make it sound as if cancelling the parties means that, to use your words, it's as if you're not allowing people to take a break and clear your head and so on, but parties are not the only way you can do that, though. You can give people a day off, you can bring in people to do all kinds of different, I'm saying there are different ways of allowing people to relax and decompress, but let me bring back in the others. Mr. Thompson there, Mr. McGarrett.
