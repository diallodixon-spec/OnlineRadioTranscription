20251229 092718 We can sit for a while and you can make clear All the things I've never known There are plenty of questions, but so little time But one thing I can't seem to get off my mind For the life of me, I can't understand why you love me like you do For the life for me I can't comprehend why I mean so much to you But maybe someday and forever The answer will be clear to see You did what you did All for the life of me
