a few minutes but but let's start because you mentioned that let me go back a little bit I know you said it's painful for you but I think it's so important to allow people to see where you're coming from you know and and you use the words there you said only a hero could survive which suggests that you're a hero and we want to hear a little bit about that heroic journey yourself but how was it that you ended up in state care? So my parents left and according to family, I was left in one place where I wasn't being treated properly. And that sounds like I was somewhere between infancy and I was in infancy. And so I bounced from that place to this woman who is supposed to be my mother's aunt, which would make her my grandaunt. So this child was just thrown on her without any plans. And she really had no interest in having me.
