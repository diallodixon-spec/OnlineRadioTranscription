20251222 214932 Yeah, now everything I go do for my baby. Everything my baby. So many things you did do, nobody do me like you do. Everything my baby, everything my blues. So many things, you did do nobody. You play happy to lose. And I get the money, money for two, over my retina when you come through, now you be my person, a person, forget each other, I need blessing, other guys they don't teach me lesson, it's not only you many things you did do, nobody do me like you do My take on my muse, everything my baby My rhythm and blues, so many things You did do, nobody like you do I carry you on my head, my shoulder Rock up on you, my knees and toes
