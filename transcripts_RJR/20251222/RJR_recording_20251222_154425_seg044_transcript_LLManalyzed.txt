20251222 154425 Melissa, I want to ask what about the small realistic ways that people can create moments of peace during a holiday such as Christmas? All right, I would say focus on gratitude. At this time of the year, and with all of what is happening in the country, we still have to be grateful for what we have. I mean, Christmas is definitely not gonna be the same for everybody in Jamaica this year, but focus on what you have. With the breath, focus on the breath, your life, that is a gift. Focus on that. Having an attitude of gratitude will make all the difference. So don't focus on what you don't have. Don't focus on what we can't afford to buy. Don't don't focus and what you're you you probably want to do
