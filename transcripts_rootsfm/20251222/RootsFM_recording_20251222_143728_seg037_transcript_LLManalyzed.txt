20251222 143728 I've got so much love to give you Too less more, baby, love Too less the world I do More for you My world was so empty, baby And my life was unfulfilling Unfulfilling, unfulfilling When I needed someone to put me up, darling You were so, so, so willing So. Now to do with me seems like a little thing. But to me, it's like a world on a swing. I've got so much love to give you.
