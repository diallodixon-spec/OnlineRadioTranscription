But you're really lovely underneath it all And do you want to love me underneath it all? I'm really lovely, underneath it all And you're really lovely So many moons that we have seen are stumbling back next to me I've seen what through and underneath and you make me better, better, better Cause I'm a little tall, you want me real brimstone And like the heat from the fire, you are always burnin' at the same time
