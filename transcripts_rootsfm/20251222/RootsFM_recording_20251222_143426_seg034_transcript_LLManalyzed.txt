20251222 143426 Just to have you by my side. Just to help me dry the tears that I cry. And I am sure that I will give you a try. And if you want, I'll try to love again. Baby, you can't around much anymore I stop dropping by without an appointment because i heard laughter coming through your door sometimes later that you still call me before you
