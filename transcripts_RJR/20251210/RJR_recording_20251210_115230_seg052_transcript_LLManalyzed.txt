6 7 6 1 5 8 8 8 9 9 1 2 0 8 0 someone so let me see this one here now hello okay so come to you right there all right good morning good morning yes sir go ahead please yes I have a concern regarding the water in Brighton Santa Cruz. Yes. I am wondering, I know that this is not really the National Water Commission, but when will water be restored to that community? My issue also is that no communication is made to the residents, to the citizens of that community. And I find that to be in very poor taste. If they are communicating with us, then we can understand. It's about five weeks post Hurricane Melissa, and we haven't heard anything.
