Instead, let us declare that God has already given us everything we need. When we face temptation, let us remember His promises empower us to escape corruption. When we feel weak, let us lean on His strength, not ours. This promise is not just for one of us, it's for all of us.

So let us hold fast to this truth. God's power is enough.
