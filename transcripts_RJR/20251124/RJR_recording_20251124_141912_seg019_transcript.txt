You can't get around it no matter how hard you try You better believe it If you should find out that you are no different than I reply The only difference I can see is in the conscience And the shade of the skin doesn't matter We laugh, we chatter, don't we smile We all at home And the feelings that make up those faces Always renew So true, so true, and for you
