I will fulfill all your needs I will fulfill all the dreams Together we will achieve Your love is what I need, girl Finger snapping, I will take you shopping. Girl, take a ride with me. Ain't no stopping, we gonna make it happen. Girl, come and ride with me. She wondering if it's just a flick. She wondering if is there someone I see. A true queen, need a king Baby girl, you are my everything Even when I'm a thousand miles away The way you step the stairs In my mind I see your pretty face I would never get better than that
