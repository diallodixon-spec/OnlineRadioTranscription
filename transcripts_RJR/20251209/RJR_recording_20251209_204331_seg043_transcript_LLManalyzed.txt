============================================================

medical term for clotting, coagulation. So if we go into a hyper-coagulability state, that means we're going to a state where our bodies are ready to clot. So the least likely thing, it will clot because it is anticipating that there's a potential loss of blood. And to save you from that potential loss of blood, the clotting factor is going to overdrive. So at the least little opportunity to clot, it will cause a clot to occur. Now other causes for hypercoagulability states are pregnancy, especially later on in pregnancy. Fractures, surgeries, stress, high stress can cause one to go into this state. So we have to be careful when we've encountered or undergone any such situations because it increases the risk or likelihood of a clot developing in our veins.
