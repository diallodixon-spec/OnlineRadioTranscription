Let's encourage them out there. Let's tell them that the blessing of Abraham is on their life. Oh my brothers and sisters, because you are in Christ. You are Abraham's heir. And you have an inheritance on your life. You're the heir to the promise God made to Abraham. Go get your inheritance. Anybody gonna go get it out there? Ah. Here we go, y'all. Ah.
