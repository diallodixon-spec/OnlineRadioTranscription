raw but you have to get past the order and get to the drink because the drink tastes phenomenal oh and it smells good it don't smell good to start off really really strong rotten etc oh wow but when you taste it it is quite refreshing especially when you mix it with guava or mango or soursop very very refreshing. So how do you ferment it? Get the ripe fruits. My grandmother usually, you know, you put it in a plastic bag, you tie it on the line and allow it to ferment in the sun. Now you can get jars. So you add the ripe fruits in there and allow them to ferment for a couple days or weeks depending on how strong you want to drink and then you can juice it it produces a lot of juice where you can literally squeeze it cheese cloth or something like that for ease you can get the ripe fruits add water and you can blend it
