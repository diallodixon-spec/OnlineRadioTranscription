20260102 114120 It is what all courtesy Margaret wall and here we go RUN UP FRIDAY! Because I ain't never heard like this before Don't want to think about her Or wear a ring without her Don't want to hit the karaoke bar Can't sing without her So make them drink strong Cause brother, she's gone And if I'm ever gonna move on I'ma need some whiskey glasses
