20251231 162319 people from down there from Louisiana doing lineman work and so far I've bigged them up. I've been to Trinidad too. I saw people from Trinidad. I think I've been to a lot of other countries. But the US is doing a lot down there. And by the way, I have been a lot down there as well. Yes, I think Canada just came in with a center truck, so I want to be of Canada also. But I just want to say, I'm doing a lot for my family down there, but I want that road in Springmount to be fixed. I'm going to call Mr. Butler's office after the New Year. I'm talking to Nikesha Birchman and she's very upfront and she's very trying. But I'm going to talk to Mr. Butler.
