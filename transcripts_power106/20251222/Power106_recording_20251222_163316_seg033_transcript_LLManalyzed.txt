20251222 163316 It's been a long, long time. And it's late while you cross my mind. I guess it's just too late. Gee whiz, it's Christmas. It's funny that I haven't thought to call you before. And why is it I haven't seen you around anymore? Another year has passed and I can't erase the memory of your smiling face. So I had to call you up and say, gee whiz, it's Christmas. Sound.
