20251217 152819 This is my last heartbreak song, this is my last heart break song I'll be good on my own, I'll be good all on my own Why are you so quick to leave When we both can make it worse When I'm gone, I'll make you nervous If you hurt me, I deserve it I've been acting foolishly Forgetting what you were You start loving me, I know this But even chaos serves a purpose It feels good to love somebody And somebody loves you bad So don't give in till you change mind Cause I'll be here for a lifetime You don't have to pretend to bow Because it's crystal clear now, now Guess it's bye to the good times And I'll be gone by the sunrise I'll be back down on my own
