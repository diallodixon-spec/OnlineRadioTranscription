20251212 190404 this week. The Ministry of Health and Wellness in collaboration with the Inter-American Development Bank, IDB, will be conducting an ecological feasibility study of all hospitals located in coastal areas. Portfolio Minister Dr. Christopher Tufton says the study's findings will guide the government's decision on whether to relocate these hospitals and redevelop construction plans. Hospitals under the study include the population, but also to the changing dynamics in the climatic situation that we're currently experiencing. Globally, we have had meetings already, terms of reference has been developed, an appropriate entity will be secured to do that ecological study, and it's a rapid study, so we're hoping to have some results in the early new year. Dr. Tufton was speaking at a press conference held at the Ministry's office in New Kingston
