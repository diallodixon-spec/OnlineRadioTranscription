20251231 135548 And thank you for this year. Hello? Yes, man. Same to you, same to you. Yes, yes. All right. You know what I'm saying? You know what I mean? But as far as social harmony, and you know what I mean, all the way, at least, you know, in some units, not sometimes. I think these are important instruments in social, you know, social structure, you know. Yeah, but we're talking about them drivers don't account for none. We talk about unity all the while. We're not unified. We only get unified when reggae boys are playing oblique civillatier down the track and so on. That's the only time we really show any unity from top to bottom in this society. So I need more than that. Who shall harm honey? Is that what you were really into you're saying? No. Alright, alright.
