20251229 100606 Peace of mind. That's just what I seek to find. Oh yeah. I ain't in the mood. I just need some solitude. Oh gosh. But everybody's trying to talk to me and nobody's trying to hear me. So you've got some things to say honestly you just i'll move you out the things you say it makes no sense and we're not at a time to figure it out leave me alone it's best you just leave me out see what i'm trying to say is that this caused me so much pain Feeling like I've got no control over my own brain When it's sad to see that you don't see it's driving me insane Leave me alone
