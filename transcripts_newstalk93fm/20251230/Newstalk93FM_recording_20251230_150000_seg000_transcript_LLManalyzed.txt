20251230 150000 That's where we leave our discussion on the medical equipment donation to the Cornwall Regional Hospital. I'm Andre Palmer. Thanks for listening. A production of the Jamaica Information Service, the voice of Jamaica. The preceding program was brought to you in time, made available for government broadcast. You're listening to Sleek Radio, 93 FM. I have a lightning spirit Early in the morning I hat it Me cooler ready, me ice done ready Me punching that's automatic I have a lightning jumbie A kind of energy inside me And it ready for the rum, ready ready for the rum Ready ready for the rum ready for the action A spiritual encounter Killing me soul taking over Telling me to start up the drinking Can't do away with good behaviour So we out on the road now BOOM! It's Mars and Riddy
