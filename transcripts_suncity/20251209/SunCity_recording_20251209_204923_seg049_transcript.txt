Yeah, my body good, yeah, me feels cute, yeah, me born blessed, yeah, me with me healed. The shine on your palate, yeah, me put you up and mute. Me a big, bright dream. Any man, them stick like glue. But me not so kind, it's not another dream. Only say a word to my girl. Me a big bright dream, any man. Them stick like glue, but me not so kind is not another dream. Think about it, you know it's a pilot. RASMILES ON THE RADIO!
