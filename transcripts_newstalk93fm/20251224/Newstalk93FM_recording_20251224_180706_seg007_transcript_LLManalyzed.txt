When outside is pouring rain, put a button on the fire. Poppin' in your, poppin' in, you're poppin' in the tuba. Raise the temperature higher. Comin' in, you comin' in, you coming in closer. Make the thing catch a fire. Spill it all make my day, I'm missing it, we're not gonna love, oh yeah And no matter what they go say I hold in your clothes I could never let you go
