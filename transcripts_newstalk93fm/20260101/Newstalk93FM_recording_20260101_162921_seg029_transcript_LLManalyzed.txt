20260101 162921 Let me be your woman. Woman, woman, woman. I can be your lady. I'm a woman. I'm a mother. But they got a problem. Put some babies in your life and take away the drama. Put the paper in a picture like a diorama. Gotta face a lot of people that are opposite. Because the world told me we ain't got that common sense. Gotta prove it to myself that I'm on top of shit. And you would never know a guy without a goddess is honest as shit. And I'm just kidding, I could be on everything. I mean, I could be the leader, head of all the states. I could smile and jiggle and tell his pockets empty. I could be the CEO just like a Robin Fenty. And I'ma be there for you cause you on my team, girl. Don't ever think you ain't had these dreams, girl. They wanna pit us against each other when we succeed. And no reason. They wanna see us end up like we Regina or mean, girl. Princess or queen, tomboy or king. You've heard a lot, you've never seen. Mother oath, Mother Mary rise to the top. Divine feminine, I'm feminine. Let me be your woman.
