20251219 125438 I like the shape and stuff like that. But so when I'm looking for other holes, I want the roof is the first thing I look at. Right through the first thing. So brethren, what is the most suitable if there is any such thing type of roof that you would recommend? No. Well, I think common the common choice would probably be a concrete slab roof. Yeah. But there are climatic issues with that. the heat gain and the overall discomfort that you can add it yeah so we have you know modern types of types of hip roofs that use constructions like standing seam or it's a whole lot more resilient yes and can still afford the occupants you know general comfort yes yeah but sometimes the roof also leaks. Yeah, it does if it's not constructed properly. Okay, gotcha. All right, so which one would you recommend? So I am all for a good standing seam slope
