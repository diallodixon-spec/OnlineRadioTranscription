20251215 125643 Just love me Deep as the blue sea, deep as the blue sea Love me really and truly And even though the storms will come, no, we won't run Just love me, deep as blue sea Wherever the wind may carry us I will never let you go One thing I have to say to you I just love it, it'll make flowing into me. And even though the waves out from this love is deeper, deep as can be.
