**Interview with Ms. Diane Campbell and Ms. Oshin Levy of VM Group**

In a recent interview on Radio Jamaica's "Talk With Substance" program, host Emily Shields sat down with Ms. Diane Campbell, branch manager of VMBS, and Ms. Oshin Levy, marketing specialist, to discuss the VM Group's financial education initiative, "Your Money, Your Future." The conversation focused on the group's iSave facility, a contractor savings plan that rewards consistent savings with higher interest rates than regular savings accounts.

Ms. Campbell explained that the iSave facility is a goal-oriented, structured savings plan that allows individuals to save in different currencies, including Jamaican dollars, US dollars, Canadian dollars, and British pounds. She highlighted the benefits of the plan, including higher interest rates, which range from 2% to 5% depending on the amount saved.

Ms. Levy added that having an iSave account also provides access to other opportunities within the VM Group, such as investments, pensions, and other financial services. She also announced the VM Home-tastic Giveaway Promotion, which will give away a brand new two-bedroom house at the Phoenix Park Village 2 in St. Catherine, as well as four quarterly cash prizes of $150,000 throughout 2026.

To participate in the promotion, individuals must have an active iSave account and deposit a minimum of $25,000 per month. The promotion runs from December 1, 2025, to December 31, 2026, and the grand prize will be awarded in early 2027.

The interview provided valuable insights into the VM Group's financial education initiative and the benefits of the iSave facility. Listeners can visit the VM Group's website or visit any of their locations island-wide to open an iSave account and participate in the promotion.

As Ms. Campbell noted, "The iSave facility is a great way for individuals to save towards their goals and earn higher interest rates on their savings." Ms. Levy added, "We're excited to offer this promotion and encourage individuals to take control of their financial futures."

The interview was part of the "Your Money, Your Future" series, which aims to educate listeners on personal finance and provide them with the tools and resources needed to achieve financial stability.
