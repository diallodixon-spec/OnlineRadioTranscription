20251215 204430 The way I follow my heart And it led me to a miracle, hey love But don't you buy me nothing Cause I am feeling one thing Your lips on my lips That's a Merry Merry Christmas It's the most beautiful time of the year Lights fill the streets, spend so much cheer I should be playing in the winter snow But I'ma be under the mistletoe I don't want to miss out on the holiday But it can't stop staring at your face I should play in the winter snow, but I'ma be under the mistletoe, yeah Shawty with you Shawty with you Under the mistletoe Shawty with you
