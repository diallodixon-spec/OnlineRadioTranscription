You're going to have to pay, and if you decide, say, you want a police record because your mother filed for you or your father, you're not going to get it. As simple as that, you know. You didn't kill anyone, you didn't do anything, but you have outstanding warrants. If you have pending court cases, say you have a court, you have a case before the court. Remember, you know, you're not not guilty you know you're it's a process you're not getting a police record if you have pending court cases you're not getting any police record because we don't know the outcome of your case so you have to stay with us until the court the case ends so pending is an operative word because you really don't know what the outcome is going to be yeah so it't know. So it's pending. But you cannot get it. You cannot get it because we can't tell you, we can't get a record. I wouldn't know if you're going to be convicted. Right. So as best as possible, if you know it in yourself, if you have a court case now and you go, you get them file for your filing, come through and you need a police record and you have court Monday.
