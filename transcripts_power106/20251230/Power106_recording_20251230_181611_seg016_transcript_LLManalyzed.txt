20251230 181611 I will play once again Chief Williams here. Hi Cliff, I'm hearing you, but you're a little bit muffled. Well, all right, we try, but I'm hearing you loud and clear clearly at my end here. So I hope you'll be able to have this conversation. All right, now the first thing we want to look at, we have lost some time, but the first thing you want to look at is just give us an overview of 2025. And then we can take it from there. All right. Thank you very much for having me on your program again. You're always glad to be on and to share. 2025 was not as bright a year as 2024, by which I mean in 2024 we were riding high. We won the inaugural Challenger Series beat in Lebanon and Puerto Rico. Matches being played between Chicago and Toronto.
