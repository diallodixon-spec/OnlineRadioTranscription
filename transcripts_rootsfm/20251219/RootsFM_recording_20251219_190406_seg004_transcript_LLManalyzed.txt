20251219 190406 I'm gonna take a little time A little time to look around me I've got nowhere left to hide It looks like love has finally found me In life, there's been heartache and pain. I don't know if I can face it again. I can't stop now. I've traveled so far to change this lonely life I want to know what love is I want you to show me
