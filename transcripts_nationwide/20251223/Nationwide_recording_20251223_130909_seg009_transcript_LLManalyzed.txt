20251223 130909 3 p.m. then we make way for the E-Zone all right yeah but for now we drop some souls yes man get in the mood right you know where it is falling and all them things and we are getting everybody know them feelings today all right yeah man that is it so here we go it's all because of you I'm feeling sad and you You went away Now my life is just a rainy day And I love you so How much you'll never know You've gone away and left me lonely Untouchable memories seem to keep haunting me another love so true that once turned all my gray skies blue but you disappeared now my eyes are filled with tears
