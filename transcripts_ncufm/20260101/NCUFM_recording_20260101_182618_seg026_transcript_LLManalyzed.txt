Sister Maureen Foster said, yes, Michael, I was thinking that I want to pray more and worship more in my home and have a closer walk with God. Those are the things I want to carry over and I want to leave stress and gossip and weakness and malice keeping in our church behind. It must stop now. It's not like you're telling me what other people must leave behind, you know? But yeah, I got you, I got you. Yeah, man, I wanted these answers to be personal, you know, and yeah, yeah. Living beyond fear and moving forward, holding on to Jesus. What I'm aiming to carry over for 2026? Take care of my body. Take care of my weight and start taking my pressure tablets and don't tell myself that I don't have any pressure.
