Can you tell us a quick history of the Jamaica Ski Federation and your daddy? A little bit about that for us please. I'm sure he's going to want to know the genesis of the Jamaica ski federation. Well, so my father Richard Sam set up the Jamaica Ski federation back in the 90s. He himself was an Olympic skier. He skied for Great Britain when he was younger. And he had always aspired for myself to represent Jamaica. So I used to race with a British racing team. Whether I would like to represent Jamaica, when I got given the opportunity, I jumped. That would be amazing. So we set up the Jamaica Ski Federation, or he set it up, and then I went on to represent Jamaica in the 1999 World Championships
