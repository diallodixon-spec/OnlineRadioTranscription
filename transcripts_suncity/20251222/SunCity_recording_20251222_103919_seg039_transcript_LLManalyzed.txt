20251222 103919 Give love on Christmas day The man on the street and the couple upstairs All need to know there's someone who cares Give love on Christmas Day No greater gift is than our love People you don't know smile at night You And the world's sincere And you wish you could have more Than just presents from a store Why don't you give love a Christmas hand? Every little child on Santa's knee
