As long as you have done one of the entry mechanics I shared earlier on, giving a plan, popping up, etc., then you are entered in our prize pool for an opportunity to win. And when did this digital gift-a-smile promotion begin? Our promotion began in December, the beginning of December December and it went from now until January the 24th. All right so you've had winners already then? We do because some persons will be getting called very shortly so again save the number guys in 76 619 5000 if somebody calls you for my number other than that, it's not us. Right. And the vouchers you say, if we win the vouchers, do we need to redeem it to the person who's actually won it or can we give it to somebody else and it will still be honored?
