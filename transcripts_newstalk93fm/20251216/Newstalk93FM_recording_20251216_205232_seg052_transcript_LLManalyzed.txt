20251216 205232 I come from the sub-Jamaica, I watch a drek. Dancers say laugh, dance off the cuff. Liquors say laugh, Georgie wants a laugh. People really see it and have to laugh. Promoters on the side, you have to laugh. Oh, them laugh. Born and grow in Jamaica. No matter where I go, I'm not leaving. I said I'm not leaving Jamaica. Not at all. I could have never left Jamaica. In comes King Kabaka, lyrical champion. Watch me chop up the rhythm like a sword from Japan. So bright and for squint like a real Chinese man. Practitioner of yoga but not Indian. Lyrics them a weapon of mass destruction. Me have nuclear bomb like a American. Can't overstand like an Egyptian. I'm a glyphic when me shift it to the fifth dimension. When the rhythm not a fit me religion. You get twist up and plot up like a Brazilian.
