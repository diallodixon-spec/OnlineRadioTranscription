many areas in St. Elizabeth. A Kompong seems to have suffered quite a bit of damage. Can you first tell us how bad it was right after the storm? So, a Kompong was significantly hit by Hurricane Melissa. The eye wall of the hurricane passed directly over the community and adjoining districts and left in its path a significant amount of devastation. In a Kompong by itself, approximately 80% of homes damaged. And damage that some, when I say damaged, their levels of damage meaning either totally destroyed or their roofs were totally torn off and rendered uninhabitable. So a lot has gone in since the devastation to bring recovery and relief to those persons most in need. And that has been on its way for the last four, maybe five weeks now, Diane. So your current status, you would say, is what? How are things now? So where we are now, we've done quite a bit of relief.
