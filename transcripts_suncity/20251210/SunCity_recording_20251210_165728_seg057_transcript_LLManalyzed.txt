============================================================

You and I were meant to be forever Maybe on my early morning of light As long as there's a sun we'll be together I can't wait to be with you my love tonight Cause you and I When we make the lovers paradise You and I, We, I just want you to know. All the punch, all the punch, whoop whoop, one knock, cha-ching. It's my turn to teach you how to win.
