Good morning sir, morning. Hello? Hello George. Morning man, how are you? Yeah man, morning, morning, morning. How are you doing? First of all, I am using the Jamaican term, Mr. Banswell. Not for only being parents, but for being attentive to what is going on around them in terms of what they observe. So I leave it there because the police matter. Yes. The person who made whatever comment was made, because I don't have any internet in, I can't see what's going on. I'm talking to you already.
