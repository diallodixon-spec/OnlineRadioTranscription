2025-12-12 06:10:00 And leave me room to be free No one's ever touched me Quite the way you've touched me People search a lifetime To find what we have You are the love of my life One thing that's's good in this life. And in a world full of change, one thing I'm sure of. You are love of my life. One thing that makes sense in this life. I'll spend the rest of my days just loving you. You are the love of my life, and I thank God I'm alive to spend my lifetime with you.
