20251222 185430 finished just outside of her personal best in the sprint event and says the early signs are encouraging. I recently competed at the Swim England Short Course Championships and it was a really strong start to the season. I was right on my PB in the 50 Butterfly. I swam 26.6, just 0.2 over my best time of 26.4. So I'm feeling confident heading into long course, which is usually where I'm stronger. Caldebank, who made her senior debut for Jamaica at the 2024 World Aquatics Championships in Doha, is also adjusting to life with a new kid partner as she bills towards the rest of the season. The Butterfly Specialist expressed gratitude for the support while also acknowledging her current sponsor as she continues her preparation. I also recently got to work with Feisty Activewear, a new brand focusing on empowering women of ethnic minorities and encouraging women to step into their power in every space.
