20251218 182515 I'll be gone by the sunrise. I'll be better on my own. Nobody should call my phone. This is my last heartbreak song. I'll be good on my own. Why are you so quick to leave? we both can make it worse When I'm gone, I'll make you nervous If you hurt me, I deserve it I've been acting foolishly Forgetting what you are You start loving me, I know this But even chaos serves a purpose it feels good to love somebody and somebody loves you back so don't give in to your dreams boy cause are we here for a lifetime you don't have to pretend to bow because it's christmas right now
