20251224 122210 I'm putting it on the beat, but nothing's right just about how life's set. If you don't know hard life, then you don't know life yet. But call me papa, just call me poverty, make him a screw. Him never know, say me have a interview. But, oh, me still have to put on the show because they don't know. I said they don't know, yeah. They don't know. They see me smile, but they don't know what I feel inside. Only you know, girl, only you know. Yeah, yeah. They see you smile, boy, but they don't know what you feel inside. Yeah, side. So lonely, make me ballin', lonely, make me cry. Cause they don't know, what I feel inside. Lonely, make my ballin'. Do you know what I feel inside?
