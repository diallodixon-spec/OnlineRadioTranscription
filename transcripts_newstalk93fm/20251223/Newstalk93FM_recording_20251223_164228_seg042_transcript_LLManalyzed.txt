20251223 164228 Follow me, come and see what you mean to all of me. You're a treasure in my eyes. The greatest pleasure in my life. Cause when you're living for the me, honesty, I'll refuse. Home is where the heart should be. Pretty feathers in disguise. Not together we will rise. So don't I ever Let you down my friend, it was a misunderstanding So if I took it for granted Then I promise from today I go drunk like I never drunk Waved like I never waved Pined like I never won before Just to show you I sell me, I sell me And I need you back in my life You got people by the truck Emotions on my mind
