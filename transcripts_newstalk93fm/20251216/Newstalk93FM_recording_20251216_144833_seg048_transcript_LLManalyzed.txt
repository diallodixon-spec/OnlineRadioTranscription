20251216 144833 I know that you are feeling, feeling. Is this a dream? Am I awake? Moon on your skin, hands round your waist. Music is love, and I heard you not play. The way how you moving got me feeling away, away, away. Both of you pull up like your favorite song. Me wouldn't mind if you think about me when you play this one. All the stars align. Used to have you on my mind. You're here with me right now.
