20251217 134733 to hear that the Lord will destroy Israel, as the same term has been previously used to refer to the annihilation of the Canaanites. God is not partial. As surely as the promises of the Lord have been faithfully fulfilled concerning Israel's blessings, the curses of the covenant, Leviticus 26 and Deuteronomy 28, will also become true if the Israelites reject the covenant. In light of the dispossession and destruction of the Canaanites, these verses demonstrate once again that Yahweh is ultimately the judge of all the earth. He declares war against sin irrespective of where it is found. Israel was not sanctified and did not acquire special merits through participation in holy war any more than the pagan nations did when they later became the means of Yahweh's judgment against the chosen nation.
