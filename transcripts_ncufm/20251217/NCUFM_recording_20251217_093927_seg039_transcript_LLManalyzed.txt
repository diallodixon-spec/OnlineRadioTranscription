20251217 093927 I can't walk without you Lord, I can't talk without you Love, I can't feel without you I can't live without you I'm not being without you I can live without you I can't breathe without you Say I can't be without you And Lord I'm convinced that there is no, no me without you Lord, I am. I can't talk without you. I can't sing without you. I'm not a thing without her. I can't live without you, I can't breathe without you.
