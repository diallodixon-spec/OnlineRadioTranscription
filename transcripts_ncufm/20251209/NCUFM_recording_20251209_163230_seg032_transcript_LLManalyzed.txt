Now this is important for record-keeping and it helps the recipient know when the letter was sent. Again, it's not like now you send an instant message, you pick up your phone, you message somebody, you send it right now, they get it right now. Then letters being sent post you probably okay i'll put it in your mailbox for some persons who have that and it's come they pick it up or you carry it to the post office to put the sender maybe i don't know two weeks later so the person won't get it tell me
