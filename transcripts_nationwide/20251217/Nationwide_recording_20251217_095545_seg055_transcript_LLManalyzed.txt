20251217 095545 circumstances that Jamaicans are upset about and the minister did say it you know it's due to the current license and so there's not much else that can be done in that regard based on what we're hearing from the minister we will have to be going through this until the government can renegotiate with JPS or with another company that may be coming with another offer we don't know. It may possibly be with JPS under a new license or it may be another company coming in to say hey we have a better offer and so the government will have that decision to make renegotiations but that won't happen until about 2027. So we are some ways away from that and so we will have to deal with JPS in this way under this license for some time that's all the time we have this morning for the consumer or we are gonna make way now for Cliff Hughes
