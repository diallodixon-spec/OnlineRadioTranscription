20251219 095238 sit down with Trump and defuse this type of thing in the Caribbean. We don't need this, you know, but no, not the Caribbean, I like a war or anything. Just to tell you, though, that when President Trump makes a decision as to what he thinks is the best in the interest of him and his country, there's no dissuading him from that, you know. Okay? And that's why he has these presidential orders that he just gets up and does them. He doesn't have to go through Congress. So even if Congress is against him, he has the power to do that and he has used it. No other president has done it to the extent that he has. And that's just the personality of the man. The United Nations has power against countries that are less powerful.
