The people on the south side of St. Elizabeth come up in Junction, Bullseye, Top Hill, anywhere around here have an abundance of scallion. And look here, man, I like maple market, and I have a love affair with coronation market. But let me tell you something.

All right, Miss Macy, and I'm not going to keep you for much longer because you came here on other business and I have stolen your time. Thank you so very much. No mention at all and tell them to come by the ladies. Alright, we'll do. Maisie Miller there. I tell you we're having a fantastic time here on location. So she came for Other Business and we have grabbed her.
