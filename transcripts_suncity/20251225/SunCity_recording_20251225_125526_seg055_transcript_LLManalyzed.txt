20251225 125526 There's no better time. From this fear, I will break free. And I'll live again with love. And know they can't take that away from me. And they will see. To feel the chance to live again I'll reach to you I know you can feel it too We'd make it through A thousand dreams I still believe I'd make you give them all to me I'd hold you in my arms and never let go. I surrender.
