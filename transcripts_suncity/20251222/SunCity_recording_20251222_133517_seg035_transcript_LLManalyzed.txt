Join Chris the Dean during the SMS show every Tuesday at 8.15 a.m. as he plays the songs and you make the decisions. Bust it or flush it on You're Ready with a Difference. If you love it, we bust it. If you don't, let's flush it. Mother in Crisis is calling on all Jamaicans to support the rebuilding of our nation. We're calling on corporate Jamaica and small businesses and souvenirs for sponsorships and to advertise on our station, which will create funding to allow Mother in Crisis to carry out their many programs, which will, in return, assist in the rebuilding process.
