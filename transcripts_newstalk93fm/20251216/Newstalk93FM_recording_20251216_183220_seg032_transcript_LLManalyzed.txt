20251216 183220 I know my life will never be the same You made your choice and I will not complain Don't raise your voice, please don't speak my name Just say goodbye, it's too late to lie I've been in love already so I felt re-learned But I couldn't help imagine it could get any worse Realizing I don't know you is just real absurd I really got to say you got away with words All those moments we shared, you'd bear me a sore Behind a perfect smile were just lies that you told Said you'd always be there, I believed you for sure By what you disappear when I leave You made your choice, and I will not complain
