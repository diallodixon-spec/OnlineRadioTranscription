20251231 141110 It's five o'clock in the morning, and I don't give it a second thought. Don't think you can keep breaking your woman's heart. And she'll sit back and enjoy it. Yes it is, yes it is, between love and hate. The sweetest woman in the world could be the leanest women in the world. You keep hurting her, she keep being quiet She might be holding something inside That'll really, really hurt you one day Here I am laying in the hospital
