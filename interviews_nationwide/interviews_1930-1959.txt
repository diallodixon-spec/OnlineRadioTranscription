**Interview with Dennis Chung**

In a recent interview on Nationwide Radio, Dennis Chung, the head of the Financial Investigations Division (FID), sat down with host George Davis to discuss his experience leading the organization. Chung emphasized the importance of having a diverse set of skills, including law enforcement and investigative experience, but also highlighted the need for strong leadership and management abilities.

When asked about the potential requirement for future leaders of the FID to have law enforcement experience, Chung stated that it would be a mistake to limit the pool of candidates to only those with such a background. He argued that leading an organization like the FID requires a range of skills, including the ability to manage people, plan strategies, and make tough decisions.

Chung also spoke about the quality of the staff at the FID, praising their professionalism and integrity. He noted that despite the challenges he faced when taking on the role, he has been able to build strong relationships with the team and has been impressed by their expertise and dedication.

The interview also touched on the topic of Jamaica's democracy, with Chung expressing his belief that the country's democracy is strong and that the freedom of expression and press freedom are essential components of a healthy democratic system.

In a surprising moment of levity, the interview ended with Chung and the host exchanging expressions of affection, with Chung saying "I love you" to the host, and the host responding in kind. While this may have been an unusual way to conclude an interview, it highlighted the warm and respectful relationship between the two individuals.

Overall, the interview provided valuable insights into Chung's leadership style and his vision for the FID, as well as his thoughts on the state of Jamaica's democracy. His emphasis on the importance of diverse skills and strong leadership abilities is a valuable lesson for anyone in a position of authority, and his praise for the staff at the FID is a testament to the organization's commitment to professionalism and integrity.
