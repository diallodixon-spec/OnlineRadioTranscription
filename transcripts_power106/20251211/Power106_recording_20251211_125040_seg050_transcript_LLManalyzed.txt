$150 million is to pay for extending the stay of linesmen already here, which would mean that if additional overseas linesmen are needed to meet the government's deadline for full restoration, JPS would need more than the loan of $150 million. Our preoccupation at this junction should not have been whether the $150 million had already been paid over to the JPS, but rather to whom the JPS must turn to for additional funding to meet the government's deadline for full restoration of the grid and all other things that go with it.
