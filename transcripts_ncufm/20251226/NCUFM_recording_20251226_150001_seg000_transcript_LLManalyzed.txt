Protecting not just that. Lisa, it is so good to see you. But sorry you catch me like this, girl. My uncle said when I'm bailing, when my family go for clarity, you don't want to hear the cries of the people they put on or something. But matters worse, me hear say half of the thing they're missing. And me know say a custom. Girl, how you know say a customs? Lisa, stop going like you're not having a sense, man. You know say everybody will talk about the thing in the media. You don't want to stop listening to hear say. You ever experience that?
