============================================================

And you're the one that I've been my whole way I hope I love you all my life, my life I never believed in dreaming It never got me very far I never believed that love could find me Like an arrow through the heart I never believed in miracles Or building castles in the air Not until that day I found you Turned around and you were there From the day you came, you gave me my only point of view I've been touched by any nature, it's impossible but true I believe in you
