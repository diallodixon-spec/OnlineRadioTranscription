20251219 130304 You better be good, I'm telling you why Santa Claus is coming to town He's making bits, checking it twice Gonna find out if it's naughty and nice Santa Claus is coming... to town He knows when you were sleeping He knows when you're awake He knows if you've been better, but don't be good for goodness sake. So you better watch out. You better not cry. You better be good. I'm telling you why. Santa Claus is coming to town. Sleigh bells ring. Are you listening? In the lane, snow is glistening A beautiful sight, we're happy tonight Walking in a winter wonderland Gone away is the bluebird Here to stay is the new bird
