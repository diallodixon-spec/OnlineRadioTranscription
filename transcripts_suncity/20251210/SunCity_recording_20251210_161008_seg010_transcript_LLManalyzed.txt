That person obviously is not that so nice. Shout out to Opal, got it locked in. All right, pick up yourself Opal over there in New Haven. Loving, loving, loving, loving the vibes, all right? All right, all right, so this person says, oh, okay, all right, I read this already. Big up to the Tasty Crew. Rasta Tashai, got it, locked in. Big up yourself, Rasta Tashi. And she says, happy birthday to Margaret Brown at May Lane in Augustone. That is it. Margaret Brown, big up yourself, happy birthday to you and thanks for keeping it locked to Sun City 104.9 FM. I think this year I'm realising that there are way, way more Sagittarians celebrating their birthday. I think the only month that gives December competition is probably September. Yeah, when it comes to people celebrating their birthday.
