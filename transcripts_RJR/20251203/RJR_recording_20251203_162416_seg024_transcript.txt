Just like an old cliche, one that simply says, you can't miss what you never had. I thought that love was just a feeling that I gave to him And every turn he'd give it back But it's more than a feeling, sensation All I had to be trippin' out on the girls' body vibration But I knew all along, yeah Love is hard to come at best And I'm so glad I can stand in the day and day. I'm too fast. Oh, baby.
