Your stories include pain, rejection, deep personal battles. What was the turning point for you that made you realize that you had to make the change and that you had to share that change with all of us. My turning point was my encounter with Jesus Christ. I feel like everyone should pray for an encounter because an encounter has the capacity to keep you rooted and grounded. And God showed himself to me while I was rejected, abandoned, left alone. I met Jesus. I had my own Damascus Road experience where the scale fell from my eyes. I come to the end of myself. I started to see what I was really doing and then Jesus showed me His love, something that I was craving for in the wrong direction. So it's my encounter that really changed.
