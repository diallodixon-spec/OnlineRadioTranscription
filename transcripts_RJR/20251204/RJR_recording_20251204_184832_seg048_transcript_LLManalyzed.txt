============================================================

We just think that we've got to take it session by session. If they declare early tomorrow, we get through the first session before any loss of wickets. We go through the second session and then go into the third session. Try Zealand 2-31 and 4-66 for eight declared. The West Indies 1-67 and 16 without loss. They still need a further 515 runs to win. England were 3-25 for nine at stumps on day one of the second ashes test against host Australia in Brisbane. Joe Root is unbeaten on 1.35 after scoring his first test sentry down under on his 30th attempt.
