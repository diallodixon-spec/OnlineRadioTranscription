20251212 193533 Thank you. The Ministry of Education has not publicly commented on this matter. A press statement has not been released based on our checks up to late this afternoon, this evening. Is that acceptable in the NPTJ's book? No, but for certain, the ministry must have a reason why they too haven't said anything on the matter. The possibility is that they are waiting on further empiricism for them to come out and say something. One has to be very cautious with these things. But your very understanding of the parties involved here, Mr. Jacobs. I have to be. I'm a parent. No, but I think you would have been chomping at the bits and be supporting the parents in this matter. No, I'm supporting the parents but I cannot be adversarial with the school administration and I can't be adversarial with government.
