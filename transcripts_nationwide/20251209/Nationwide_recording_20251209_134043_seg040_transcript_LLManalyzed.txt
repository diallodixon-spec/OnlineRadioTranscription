When I look in your eyes, baby, I see clear as a morning sun I gotta take some more time off and give you extra fun And I know you like it I hope you never get tired And I never have to go to work No one talking all the time It's just past the moon, oh, there's turf inside Ready to trade but couldn't steal my name Turn around and wonder what she is made of She just loves this little thing we got going Little less as long as her heart's so beating She just loves this money
