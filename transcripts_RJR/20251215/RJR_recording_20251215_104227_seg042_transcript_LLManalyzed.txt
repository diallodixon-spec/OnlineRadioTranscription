20251215 104227 Welcome to Hotline. This is Clive Mulling. Good morning, Mr. Mulling. How are you? Not too bad. Welcome. What's happening? Season's greetings as well. Good to see you. My problem is Mr. Mulling, I know the hospitals in Jamaica, they are overwhelmed. But they have patients sitting down in chairs for days at university hospitals. There's a sticker, the person's complaining for days. They have to sit in a chair, they have a sore in legs, and they have a chest problem. I can understand there are other people who are sick as well.
