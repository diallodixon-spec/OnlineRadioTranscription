20251216 132719 who's hosting the program and if the program has a particular format historically then that format holds so if a person comes right I've seen people sit here for half an hour while other people are on the phone and they what they do is they help and they come back and so forth and he is complaining about spending three minutes holding for three minutes then nobody nobody in Jamaica holds for three minutes on radio we man credit level anyway. That's how it goes my brother. But what I'm saying, what you need to do as I said already, in your preamble you know say alright the first 10 or 15 minutes of the program you won't be taking any call.
