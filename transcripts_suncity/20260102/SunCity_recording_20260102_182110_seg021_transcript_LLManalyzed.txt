20260102 182110 Please stay. I want you, I need you, oh God. Don't take these beautiful my mind I'm feeling insane It's been a while but I'm finding my faith If everything is good and it's great Why do I sit and wait till it's gone? Oh, I'll tell you, I know I've got enough I've got peace and I've got love But I'm hoping I'll be fine
