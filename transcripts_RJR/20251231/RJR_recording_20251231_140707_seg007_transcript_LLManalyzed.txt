Oh, the friends you seek may be the ones you have. That's the thing today that we all will need for yesterday. We'll come back again. Oh, don't you burn. Oh, hear me, boy. Don't you burn your bridges down. Hear me talking to you. Don't you burp. Get it in your mind. Don't you burned your bridges down. Ooh, ooh, ooh.
