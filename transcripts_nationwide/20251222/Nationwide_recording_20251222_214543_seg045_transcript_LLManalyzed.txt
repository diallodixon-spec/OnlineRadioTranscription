20251222 214543 Sailing with a cargo full of Love and devotion So I'd like to know where You got the notion Said I'd like to where You got the Notion Rock the boat, don't rock the boat baby Rock the boat, Don't tip the boat over Rock the boat Don't rock the boat over, rock the boat Don't rock the boat, baby, rock the boat But tonight we sail through every storm And I've always had your tender lips to keep me warm Oh, I need to have the strip that flows from you Don't let me drift away, my dear, when love can see me through Our love is like a ship on the ocean We've been sailing with a cargo full of love and devotion
