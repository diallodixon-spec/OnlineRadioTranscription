20251217 094231 charges and JPS are not so sure exactly what JPS means if it means the LNG plant at all I doubt it but the plant that broke to my mind would fall under the LNG would fall under the JPS umbrella still and this is owned by JPS that's not a private arrangement okay right So I don't know how this number is broken down right now, in terms of more precise detail, but JPS is down this month 33% of the bill from 34% last month. IPPs down to 15% from 16% last month. But fuel has gone up 45% from 43% and taxes is still 7%. But now you know the government still have other taxes that they earn apart from their direct 7% that they charge on the bill. There are other things that they earn from.
