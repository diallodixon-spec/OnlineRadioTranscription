============================================================

If you've got life, then give God praise You may not have much, but you're living day by day You can't have faith and don't want to work Get up off that seat And put that brain to work It's a beautiful day It's a Beautiful Day It's a Beautiful day It may not be the way I want it to be But I thank you for every situation That made me good and bad friends That came into my life And those who are still here today
