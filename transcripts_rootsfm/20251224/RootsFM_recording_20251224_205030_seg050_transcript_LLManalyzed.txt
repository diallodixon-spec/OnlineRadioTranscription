20251224 205030 Hallelujah. We rest in heaven, we rest forever, we rest forever. We lift our heads, we raise our heads. We join the hearts of heaven, to sing of God's reign. We belong as the kings of kings, the dreams of kings, I am not alone, I am not ready, we live forever. I'm not ready, I'm not ready.
