Conrad O'Brien Interviews Darrington Ferguson on Newstalk 93 FM

In a recent broadcast on Newstalk 93 FM, host Conrad O'Brien interviewed Darrington Ferguson, the counselor for the Papine Division. Ferguson, who made headlines when he dethroned former PNP counselor Venetia Phillips, joined O'Brien to discuss various topics.

During the interview, O'Brien and Ferguson touched on several issues, including the recent road works and Christmas programs in Jamaica. Ferguson shared his thoughts on the current state of affairs in the country, and O'Brien asked him about his plans and initiatives as a counselor.

The conversation also delved into the topic of crime reduction in Jamaica, with O'Brien mentioning that the prime minister had stated that the country was on track to end the year with under 700 murders. Ferguson shared his insights on the matter, acknowledging that while the numbers had reduced, there was still much work to be done to address the issue.

O'Brien also used the opportunity to praise individuals who were making a positive impact in their communities, such as Michelle Gale, who runs a breakfast program in St. Thomas, and Deputy Superintendent Bartley, who has been working with overseas connections to provide aid to those affected by Hurricane Melissa.

The interview provided a platform for Ferguson to share his vision and plans for the Papine Division, and for O'Brien to engage with his audience on pressing issues affecting Jamaica. As O'Brien stated, "Jamaicans are indeed good people, we're loving, warm-hearted, kind, fun-loving, in the main," and the conversation reflected this sentiment, focusing on the positive aspects of Jamaican culture and the efforts of individuals to make a difference.
