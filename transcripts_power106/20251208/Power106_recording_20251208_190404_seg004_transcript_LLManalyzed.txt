============================================================

The final phase is where the transformative work happens. Rebuilding infrastructure using stronger engineering, climate-ready design and future-proof standards. This includes resilient housing, rebuilding schools, hospitals and public buildings to higher resilience standards, including relocating them where necessary. Climate-smart roads and bridges, coastal and river defence systems including natural defences, strengthened public utilities and grid resilience, digital and transport infrastructure to support productivity. Our reconstruction is not merely about restoring what was lost, it is about building a stronger, more competitive Jamaica capable of withstanding future climate shocks. Prime Minister, Dr. Andrew Wholeness. That's where we end our conversation today. I'm Warren Bertram.
