20251230 163120 I remember the last time we spoke. By the way, what do you want? What are we talking about today? What are we sharing today? Thank you for the opportunity. Definitely. So I was saying good afternoon, Michael, and thanks for the opportunity to share another time. And also I'm saying good afternoon to all the listeners wherever in the world you are. We're catching on to the Spanish quite well. Wonderful. I'm using up my Duolingo. All right. Wonderful. You know, when we talk about the modern languages in schools, I know sometimes students might wonder why do I even have to learn Spanish? I live in Jamaica. It's an English speaking country. Who is Spanish for and why is it important?
