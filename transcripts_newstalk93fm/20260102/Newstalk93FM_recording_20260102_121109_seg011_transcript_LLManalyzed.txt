20260102 121109 Give me energy, real energy I tell you that we all need love Jump and show me love, wind up and show me love Together say we all need love with my head to the ceiling stay I'm drowning alone and I'm lost together, hey. I lay in my bed with my head to the ceiling. Head to the ceiling. Say I'm drowning alone, and I'm lost in my feelings. Lost in my feelings. Somebody send me a sign, because you know that I need it. You know that I need you. Can't even come back to me, because you know you're my hero.
