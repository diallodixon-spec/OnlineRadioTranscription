Can you work that out for us as to what percentage this is going to take us? three years so if we make the broad assumption that they might draw it equally in three years right yeah it means that next fiscal year is $336 billion more added to the debt so that would have put us to like 2.5 2.4 trillion dollars right yeah if we made the assumption that the 41 percent of GDP that we lost will bring GDP down to 1.9 trillion it means that we're back over 100 100%. That's the point. Yeah, precisely. That's the point? That's why the key question I want the Minister to tell us in Parliament today. What is the new debt to GDP ratio? Because when we made a projection, she was very upset and ran to the World Bank to try and back her and all of those things.
