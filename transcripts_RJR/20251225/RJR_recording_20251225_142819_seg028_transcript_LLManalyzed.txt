20251225 142819 Down, Santa Claus did not know, sir Hotel is singing, I'm a partchooser Are you taking it light? Jingle bells and sing won't put me in a spin. Cause I got my head screwed on right. Hey, now all I really want for Christmas is just to be a little bit more conscious. I don't really ever look expensive and dear. Hey, Cheyenne, do you really want to deal in Kwanzaa? I'm the rock-a-muffin in a debt differently. Have a happy new year. No, I am not ill-ill-ill-illin'. Yes, I am just chill-ill-illillin'. So go on, eat your turkey in a row.
