20251216 204731 Let us reach this generation Every tribe in every nation For we overcome the world By the blood of Christ the Lamb. We are united in Jesus Christ. We are the soldiers of the light. We don't rest on flesh and blood, but principalities of the dark. We too are marching to one week, crushing the enemy under our feet We are mighty in our stand With God's blood in our hands Lord our God is a sword and shield We fight our battles for our land
