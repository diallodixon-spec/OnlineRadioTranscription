20251224 095036 Well, maintain the discipline and, you know, just remain focused. The military people have been out there as well and the people fixing up for the Christmas, you know, secure yourself properly, you know, and also be careful and be wise in what you have to do. And, you know, don't forget our health. We can't forget that part of it because we have seen so many situations throughout the last year. People have lost quite a bit of their family members. We remain hopeful and as I said, keep the peace and keep the faith. Thanks for accommodating us and we will be doing what we have to do in the new year. We're going to want to do something different and we'll get some more objective discussions and, you know, fortresses from the powers. We need that, we need that. And we'll keep the public informed as to what is happening and where we are.
