20251218 152418 I like what I like and I fair and square because you don't know. Bounty Killer and Bounty Killer have sung out together. We're all entitled, I think, Jerome, to picking a side if we want to. It's all right. if we do what we want to do as long as it does not impede on anyone else's right. I'm not picking a side though. That's fine. Yeah, because I'm a DJ. I have to keep mutual. That's lovely. And I love that for you. To those who win in the clash, but I'm not picking any side. Both artists are great artists.
