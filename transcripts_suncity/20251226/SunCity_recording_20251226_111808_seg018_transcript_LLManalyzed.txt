20251226 111808 I could go on and on, the fool has never been told To this life he gives me down I'm living while I'm living, to the father I regret Only Only him know how we get through. Every day return the light, in the price. I'm a living y'all for pay. Why no one lead us play? All I see, feeble every panoramic. All I grind, no teeth, never no fisted teeth.
