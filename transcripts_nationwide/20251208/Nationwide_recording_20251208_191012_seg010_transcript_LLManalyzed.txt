I suspect there is a reason why Stephen Miller and Tom Homan have not selected New York City for this kind of targeting. And I was glad to see that the mayor-elect got along so well with President Trump. The mayor of New York needs to have a good relationship with the president of the United States, whoever that is, for lots of reasons. Some of us are old enough to remember Ford to city in 1975, drop dead. And so, you know, like everything with Donald Trump, you're good until you're not. But I thought it was a terrific meeting. They got off to a good start. And Trump obviously respects the mayor-elect's political skills. Right. And he's and the mayor-elect still being true to what he believes in. Curious like you to prognosticate carefully if you could. Does this have any concerns in terms of a connection to the midterms and if it doesn't overall what should governors and secretaries of states be doing right now to prepare for the midterms?
