You had a time to remember His only bomb was a fender And the chink scared gun big up the bartender When last you been to a party Girls wakin' up lookin' naughty And the DJ just drop a tune Every man bust up like wine up on a shorty And the rum just passin' on me head Champagne on me eyes red My vote hands up to the sky, I testify Tonight me nah go back home to me bed On the left, on the right, it's so much critical On to the carnival, with a bag of green on me It's so critical Send for the bad guys, cause this ring's all around me And we're having a good time Yes, we're having good time Just take the shot one time, come and enjoy the life When last you've been to a party Plenty women looking so nice We must be in paradise When last you had a time to remember His olive and butter fender And the drinks got done big up the bartender
