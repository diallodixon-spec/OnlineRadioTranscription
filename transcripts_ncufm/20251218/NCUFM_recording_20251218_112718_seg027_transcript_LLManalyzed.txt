20251218 112718 Happy birthday to these celebrants of the Newland SDA Church, Tamasha Brown, Tamara McCarthy James, and Romare Wright. They're celebrating their special day today. Wishing you lots of love song, pat yourself on the back. Venise is enjoying them all. She's also shouting happy anniversary to the Andersons. Many more happy years. Blessings from Venise.
