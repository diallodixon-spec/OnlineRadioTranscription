20251231 161916 Before you walk in my life I guess it's true Can I live without you? Don't ever go away Oh yeah, yeah Never miss a touch of something, baby, yeah I just wanna go back to being in the same And I only wanna make things right, baby Before you walk out my life, oh yeah When can my heart beat again? When does the pain never end? And when do the tears stop from running over? When does you give up?
