20251224 153920 I'm talking that we are complete, darling Heat me up Only you alone can put fire back in the soul Heat me up And they're telling me I should leave that fire alone Well, the more they tell me, it's the more I hold in you Close, close, close I could never let you go Miss Oshine, Miss Oshine Girl I'm coming home and I'll see you again All day through the night I dreamin' Miss Oshine Miss Oshine When you turn the top make it smooth my darling When outside is pouring rain Say put a button on the fire Poppin' in here, poppin' in here Poppin' in the tuba Raise the temperature higher Comin' in ya, comin' in ya Comin' in closer Make the thing catch your fire Smell it all on the ground All over the counter With that button the fire Is your cocoa tea alarm Boy, we're not feelin' under the sun
