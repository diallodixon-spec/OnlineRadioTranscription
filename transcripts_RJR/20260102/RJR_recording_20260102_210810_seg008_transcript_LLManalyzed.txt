I see that life is not easy, that's why I fight the hardest. I make you a brief, you rap and kill, you know she said that's a madness. Oh, oh, oh, me a fee work for mine. Oh, oh, I fee work for mine, oh, oh. Me a fee work for my. Oh, oh. I fee work for my, oh, oh me a foe. Double life be my teacher, say people not easy. You ain't just a sword dog, everybody greedy.
