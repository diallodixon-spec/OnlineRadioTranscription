What I don't understand is, I remember one time I gave my son somebody to go to the barber and he came back with only his a line up so I said what is what will I wear? Will I wear it? What you gonna do? I said I'm gonna line up, line up my hair. I said hey, are you gonna give me all of my money? If you line up your hair. I said come back you know, go back to the barber to give back change. No because even if you don't trim, line up. I'll wait for him to tell the barber. No, I'm not going to worry about my money man. I'll wait back to the barber and say hi. Trim back half of the money. No because that's a line up and a line up on the paper is for X amount. Lord Jesus. You're not going to come waste my money. Go get a full trim.
