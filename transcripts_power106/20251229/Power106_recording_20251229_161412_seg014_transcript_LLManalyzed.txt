20251229 161412 some stray cats, about six or more, I think about six of them. And every time you fuck up the place, they come inside there and just get, you know, the thing where you fuck up, you know. And I don't know, I can't, I won't get rid of them, Jesse. So I'm asking if any cat lovers, they are wild cats, you know, if any cat lovers around that want to get those cats, they could get some traps and trap them and then get them, because they're not so wild to that. You see, what happened now, the little area that I have, the big place that I have, to fence it up, it caused me a little treachery. I have no money, I have to get some wire, some chicken wire and all that. And it's $5,000 a year to chicken wire. Because I'm going to look at the deal and check it out. I don't really have that money to spare.
