20251215 145337 Deep as the blue sea, your love's flowing into me. And even though the waves are rough, this love is tough. Just love me. Falling out around. Deep as the blue see, deep as the blue sea. Love me really and truly. Just love me now. And even though storms will come, no, we won't run. Just love me, deep as the sea. Wherever the wind may carry us, I will never let you go. One thing I have to say to you, I'm just in love with it. I'll make me gravitate to you. Give me the compass, make me navigate to you. Fly up and sail on my way to you. As the blue sea, your love's going into me. And even though the waves out from this love, it will just love me. It's deep as the blue sea. It's flowing down and down. I said this love is for you now. No, we won't run, just love me.
