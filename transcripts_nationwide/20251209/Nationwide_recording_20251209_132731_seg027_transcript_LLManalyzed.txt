Everybody's got something they had to leave behind One regret from yesterday that just seems to grow with time There's no use looking back or wondering How we could be now or might have been All this I know but still I can't find ways to let you know I never had a dream come true Till the day that I found you Even though I pretend that I've moved on You'll always be my baby I never found the words to say You're the one I think of
