20251217 181612 We want a security committee, proper lighting, regular de-bushing. The students were frustrated, Ms. Jackson, because from the first incident a couple years ago, it was a matter of security. The second, security. The third, security. Fourth, security. And it is just consistent throat. So the students were frustrated. I am frustrated. You know, it was just too much. All right. So you say you asked for a security committee, lighting, debushing. I mean, all of that sounds reasonable and doable. What was anything else? Yeah. And I just like to add all of the things that we propose, you know, they are not fictitious. You know, they are reasonable things, things that, you know that are standard for a college or institution to operate. So what was the response? It was good. It was accepting. So we started seeing a difference last night. There was a heavy security presence on campus.
