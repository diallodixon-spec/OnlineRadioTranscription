2025-12-11 23:00:05 You don't see a banana tree, you don't see a mangled Lord Jesus, Pastor. Something to see. Anyhow, Pastor, I am giving thanks tonight, and for this time of the night. I just want to pray for everybody around the world. Churches can't go back together, gone. School gone. Home gone. Anyhow, Pastor, have a blessed night. Yeah, but I believe that we will bounce back. Yes, I'm not going to give up on the people then. If you watch this thing, I'm going to go in some big house.
