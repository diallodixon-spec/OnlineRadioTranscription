============================================================

And it's all because of you Don't tell me I don't know I want the truth Cause they call it, we call it, you call it, I call it love It's so clear for you to see Don't let nobody tell you what to do When they can't just let us be happy I don't wanna hide nobody knows If you know what's really in your heart, then don't let it tear us apart. Baby, I don't know what love is. Maybe I'm a fool. I just know what I'm feeling. And it's all because of you. Please don't tell me I don't know I want the truth Cause thinking that we call it you call it I call it love
