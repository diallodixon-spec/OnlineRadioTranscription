Yes! While you're far away and dreaming I could spend my life in this sweet surrender I could stay lost in this moment forever Every moment spent with you is a moment I treasure I don't wanna close my eyes I don't wanna fall asleep Cause I miss you babe And I don't wanna miss a thing Cause even when I dream again
