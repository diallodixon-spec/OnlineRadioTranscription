20251217 190706 There is the Shelley and Fraser Assessment Center at the University of Technology, Jamaica, and other places in Jamaica that you can go to and have your child tested and assessed to see what's really happening to the child. You're listening to Beyond the Prescription right here on Roots 96.1 FM. And if you're online listening to us, we are grateful that you're able to join us on zeno.fm. You can also call in 876-580-5706 if it is that you have a topic, a burning desire to hear of something that's happening health-wise and you want us to have a discussion on that. I'm your host, Dr. Stephanie Mullings, and this is brought to you by Providence Pharmacy, 25 Olympic Way. We're going to go to a break, and when we return, we're going to talk about Usher Syndrome.
