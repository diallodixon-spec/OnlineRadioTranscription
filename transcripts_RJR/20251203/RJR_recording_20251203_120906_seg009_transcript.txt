The St. Catherine's South Police report that the 21 males and eight females, including a juvenile, were found about 3.30 Monday afternoon in a house used as an Airbnb in Edgewater Portmore. Preliminary investigations revealed that they were picked up from the airport by a taxi service and then taken to the premises, where they paid for the accommodation, were properly logged, and then assigned rooms, most with more than one bed. The police say it was discovered that all the Haitians entered Jamaica legally via the airport between November 26 to 30 and were landed by immigration for a period of three days to thereafter transit to Panama. However, most of them overstayed. On Monday, they were interviewed and processed at the Portmore Police Station and preparations then made for their departure from the island. Thirteen of the Haitians, who had legal standing to depart Jamaica on December 2 and 3, were released, while the remaining sixteen were charged.
