20260101 151009 in the club Bouncing to reggae and hip-hop in the club Don't forget the licorice rock Oh damn, it's getting hot in the place Feel all the things lined up in your face Watch how the girls die right in their place Oh, what a reggae feeling Oh damn Throw your hands up And sing all the play like you're feeling insane then what? Keep those hands up Go up in the club and listen to Robert Dobin Everybody get worked up And I go down the wing and I go down flank like Zidane. Play it work up. Just dance, just dance, let me see you show your heart. It's getting hot in the club. Millions of females back in the club. Don't forget to lick your roots No, no, no way.
