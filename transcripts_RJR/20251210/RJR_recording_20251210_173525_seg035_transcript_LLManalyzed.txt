Thank you so much for staying with us. We continue with you on Beyond the Headlines. I'm Dionne Jaxmiller talking about an incident yesterday in Clarendon where a six-year-old child was taken from a school and found subsequently and in a second we'll talk to Seon Barnswell, Councillor Hoof, found her but we're talking to DSP Clifton Green who is in charge of crime for the Clarendon Police who was was telling us that after the father went to the school, found that the child, heard that the child had been taken by a man, he made a report to the police, and then the word was spread. DSP, the word seems to have spread through Clarendon very, very quickly. How did you do that? Well, Dionne, let me just say this, that the strengthening of the stakeholder engagements, the partnerships, over time has really given us that backdrop, you know, on which to get these kind of assistance when it is really needed. Tell me what that means.
