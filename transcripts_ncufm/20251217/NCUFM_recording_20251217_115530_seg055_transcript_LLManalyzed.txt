We're coming to you now confessing our sins because the word says that if we confess our sins, you're faithful and just to forgive us and to cleanse us. So I'm asking that as you forgive us that you would cleanse us from sin because, Father, time is wrapping up. So many things are happening around the world in America, in the UK, across the world, in Jamaica even. And it's showing, it's showing how true prophecy is and how close your turn is. Help us to prepare ourselves and to prepare our hearts. And let us turn towards you even when time gets difficult, even when things become unbearable, help us to trust you. In Jesus' name I pray, Amen.
