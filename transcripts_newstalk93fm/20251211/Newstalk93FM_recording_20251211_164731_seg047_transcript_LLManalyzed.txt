2025-12-12 10:32:17 you in my eyes. I felt bad when you were afraid. First time I asked you your name. Now you're in my domain and you're safe. And you got me saying, I ain't gonna leave. She loves, she loves you now. And I believe somehow we're in the perfect place. I ain't going to leave Finally She wants to come and stay Can't wait another day And now I don't feel so far away Feel so far away I am here to stay Well, here comes the musical thing, a love is all I bring. Come on, Papri, I'm a real lyrical sling like King David. And rhythm like this, we not play with love.
