20251218 161713 Make your bed up on my shoulders like you used to Just like you used to Don't give me that good old-fashioned loving that's so good for me You don't give it a good old-fashioned kiss So right for me so right for me Could it be that you don't love me anymore? No, baby, if you don't want me and you don't need me Then why don't you let me?
