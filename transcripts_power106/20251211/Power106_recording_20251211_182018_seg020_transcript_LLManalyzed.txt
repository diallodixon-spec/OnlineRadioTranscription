So that's her great form continuing. And again, remember that she had a bad injury ending the last season, I think, or earlier this season. So that could have taken her out of international competition somewhat because the club was trying to protect her I think and in the Guardian it had said she had taken a year off but they didn't say for what reasons but now that she's back I think you should see her climbing the ladder back up again I mean as a Ballon d'Or highly ranked Ballon d' candidate, she's naturally going to go right back up in the rankings. Let's focus a little bit on her strike rate. She's at the highest at the international level, believe it or not. 60 girls in 45 games, that gives her a 1.33 per match.
