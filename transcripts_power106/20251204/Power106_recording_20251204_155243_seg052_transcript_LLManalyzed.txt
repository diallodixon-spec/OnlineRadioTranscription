The people it's what six weeks have gone by now and people are still getting wet when it rains and West Milan it rain almost Every day down there almost every day. So people are getting wet. When it rains night and day and it's it's it's heartbreaking It's just heartbreaking and there's nowhere for them to go. Nowhere for them to go nowhere for them. One of the things that I see happening daily is the the fact that the airlines that are taking flights into the country, they are allowing people to come in with extra pieces of luggage free of cost. I think that has alleviated certainly some of the challenges that people face in terms of taking things home for their relatives who are in need. So I would encourage people to take advantage of that, particularly those who are going to be coming home to spend Christmas here at home. And it does make sense
