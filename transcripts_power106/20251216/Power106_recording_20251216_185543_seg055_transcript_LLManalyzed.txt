There's also development on the female side of football. So I would think it has an economic future if it can get on the ground and be backed. That's a great point you make about the female angle. Brazil is hosting the next version of the Women's World Cup. They all remember here who knocked them out of the last version of the women's World Cup. It was Jamaica. They didn't see that one coming. So congratulations to the Jamaicans. But Brazil will host the next one in 2027. And with the success of the women's game in the United States, you could certainly see something happening there. So maybe, and I hadn't thought about this before, thank you very much for the idea, maybe some kind of Pan-American initiative in the women's game will happen first.
