20251222 173623 Call me hero, soon as I reach the dance Bad vibes on zero National hero, soon as i reach the dance Conduct on zero I don't know about you, but I come here to fete Come to play a mask I'm not leaving until I wet Come to play a mass I don't live my life with regrets No, I come to jam on a bumper Come to drink on the liquor Until my head's gone and I'm miserable All down on the ground, I'm causing trouble Look how these security watch me, they don't know I'm out there I just mushed up in place and I defect like a jumbie and don't wait
