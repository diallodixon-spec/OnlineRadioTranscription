Check, check, check. Testing, testing. Drive time, family. Good afternoon to you. It is time for the drive right here on NCUFM, transforming lives through education and wellness. I'm happy to be here. I am happy to be tuned in with you. Let me say welcome on board of The Drive to all those who are tuned in, all my peeps who are at work right now. I know I have some persons who are at work and they're looking at the time and they're counting down and they're saying I can't wait until five o'clock comes so I can get on out of here if you're one such individual. Let me say special good afternoon to you now. Good afternoon. Special good afternoon to you. This afternoon I hope
