20251215 174534 I want you laying me down to a dead and buried. On the edge of your night, staying drunk on your vibe. The angels up in the clouds are jealous knowing we found service to our ordinary. You got me kissed in the crowd, crowd sanctuary. Trying to be what you're taught. Oh Lordek Radio, 93 FM. Is this a dream? Am I awake? Moon on your skin Hands round your waist Music is love And I heard you not play The way how you move
