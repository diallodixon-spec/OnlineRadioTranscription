20251225 093825 Santa Claus, when will you come to the ghetto? Ghetto! Santa Claus, we would like to see how your reindeer grow. All year long we've been beating down plants. How we hold on to those hard times. We ain't gonna fight, we ain't gonna fuss. We're all the presents that you brought along. Santa Claus, do you ever wonder why we're so close? Santa Claus, when will you come to the ghetto? And at boss, we would like to see how those freaks do. See you in the papers, you on TV. This is the cause to start faking. Everyone's happy for people like me.
