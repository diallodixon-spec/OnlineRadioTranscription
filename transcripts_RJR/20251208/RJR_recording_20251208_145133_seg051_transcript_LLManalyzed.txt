Let's pray. I mean, just pray. Let us pray because I think persons don't know really who God is. They just say, you know, I'm a Christian, but it's a clue that they put on a shield to say, you know. But if we really, genuinely, sincerely go to him, surrender with a perfect heart, it will get better. There's this peace that sometimes I can't even understand it, but it comes from surrendering. And he said in his word, take up the cross and follow me. He never said leave the cross, no. He said take that in me at the time. You have prayed for yourself. Yeah.
