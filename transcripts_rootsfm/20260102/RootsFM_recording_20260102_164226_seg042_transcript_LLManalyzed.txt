20260102 164226 Until the love leaves Never to say that you saw me No, no, no, no How could you hurt the one you love Just like you don't care? No, not in my book, no, no way Oh baby, baby, touch me one more time. No, no, no, no. Whisper in my ears your sweet little lies. This will keep me going, even for a moment, till you understand that it's not right. And you know that love means never to say that you're sorry. Oh, no, no, no. How could you?
