They inspect it and somebody often presents it for inspection. Eh, so how customs ever get so much concern then? Tracy, and the customs are alone involved in the clearance process, you know. Even though it's them we tend to talk about. Look at it this way. Shipment delayed, talk to your airline agent. Missing items, talk to your freight forwarder. The charges surprise you now. Call customs. But remember to collect your signed and stamped declaration or C number from your agent. So when you call customs, they can better help you. We're never too old for learning. Some of us know it all. What when customs roll on your item them now? You mean they taint it? But that's only for restricted or prohibited items Tracy. And in such case, make sure you get a notice of detention for the restricted and seizure notice for the prohibited. The information is all over them social media pages and websites Tracy.
