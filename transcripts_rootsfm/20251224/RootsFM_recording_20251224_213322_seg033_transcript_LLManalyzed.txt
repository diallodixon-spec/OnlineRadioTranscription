20251224 213322 We know it's a tropical Christmas Christmas on the islands From the sunrise to the moonlight It's Christmas in the islands The islands When the sun shines and the mood's right It's Christmas on the island The island, the island Sunshine on a silhouette, Caribbean vibes the best A place where the girls play hard to get Can't believe my heart she get, baby That day I don't regret, a Christmas I won't forget
