20251218 180303 I just want you to come and light it up Just a little winding out Come and meet me in the truck and we rev it up Say hold it, keep throwing it back I know where your stuff goes Baby no way, we could post up all the pictures you want When you're ready, I could overshare Darling, you could overshare But we could meet in the middle and start a bacchanal Play in the middle, hey What we gonna do now? Jam to a rhythm, heat a carnival. What are we gonna do now? Start a wine on it. I say compromise on it. Baby, spend time on it. I said compromise on it. Little boy, how we looking?
