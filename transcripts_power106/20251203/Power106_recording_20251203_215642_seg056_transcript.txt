============================================================

I hate to think about us all leading up together But soon as I look at you they will show my face Then they'll know that we've been loving each other We can never know, no, no, no We can't leave a trace. Secret lovers, yeah, that's what we are. We shouldn't be together, but we can't let go. No, no, because we love each other so. Sitting at home, I do nothing all day But think about you
