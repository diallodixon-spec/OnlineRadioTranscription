20251215 140907 Jesus! Stay together and we go in places I'll be by your side no matter the case We have a one way ticket to greatness You're not the one to lie Cause I believe in the truth And I just wanna live good I don't want no dirty secrets fighting me and you We drive one car at a time But I still want to, but I still want to Now that we get to the truth, truth, truth I just wanna live good Look the sun could shine the same time with the moon
