20251223 173621 This time, I think we will be, yeah, we would have officially entered the winter break. Yeah, the winter break. It's a time to have fun. It's also a time to be responsible. So to give me a proper student's perspective on balancing fun and responsibility during the holidays, I have two guests with me this afternoon. Firstly, we have a student of the Bishop Gibson High School for Girls, Ms. Gabrielle Williams and Mr. Theodore Jones, a student of the University of the West Indies. Good afternoon. Good afternoon to you. Welcome to the drive. Good afternoon. I was happy to be here. Oh, yes, man. Yes, man. I know you're ready. All right. Okay, so Mr. Theodore, this one is for you. How do you spend your holiday break while keeping God first in your plans?
