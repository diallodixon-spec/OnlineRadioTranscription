20251223 104720 It's too late to lie You give me one of them sweet lies How silly am I For watering a love that wasn't really alive And now it feels like it was all in disguise The way you switched the phone, you got me losing my mind Cause we spoke of the past and I told you the pain That I had to endure over and over again Even though you showed me this won't be the same You went and did just that, was it all just a game? I know my love will never be the same You've made your choice and I will not complain Don't you raise your voice Please don't speak my name Just say goodbye It's too late to lie Just say it's too late
