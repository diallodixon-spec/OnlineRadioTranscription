20251215 123122 says RGR radio station has been fixed because it's not coming through clearly in St Anne. Well you know after the hurricane things will happen you know I know that we're trying to sort things out. This one says someone is when your radio has been stuck on RGR since the 1960s it is hard to change and I don't want you to change either those are my words. Although Minnesota was bad I'm still disappointed that out here in Moorpark, St. James, you cannot hear RGR, nearly two months after the storm. Yes, we can go online, but that is unreliable, either from RGRs or the telecommunication companies end. For instance, I was all geared up to watch TVJ News online on Saturday night, but there was no sound. I hope we'll be able to access audio and radio soon, at least by Christmas. I really hope so as well. I know that we've been battered here in St. James, but in Moorpark especially, so the teams are working.
