**Interview with Dr. Neil Gardner on Pyomyositis**

In a recent episode of "Back to Health" on Radio Jamaica 94 FM, Dr. Neil Gardner, a chiropractor, discussed the topic of pyomyositis, a bacterial infection that causes inflammation of the muscles. The conversation was hosted by Mrs. G, who introduced Dr. Gardner and facilitated the discussion.

Dr. Gardner explained that pyomyositis is a condition where bacteria infect the muscles, leading to inflammation, pain, and swelling. He noted that the infection can cause a range of symptoms, including fever, chills, and difficulty walking. The doctor emphasized that pyomyositis is not a common condition, but it can be serious if left untreated.

When asked about the causes of pyomyositis, Dr. Gardner identified two types of bacterial infections that can lead to the condition: Staphylococcus aureus and Group A streptococcus. He explained that these infections can be treated with antibiotics, but it is essential to seek medical attention promptly to prevent complications.

The discussion also touched on the importance of seeking medical help when experiencing unusual symptoms, such as pain or swelling in the muscles. Dr. Gardner encouraged listeners to consult a medical professional if they are experiencing any unusual symptoms, as early diagnosis and treatment can make a significant difference in the outcome.

One of the most striking aspects of the conversation was the story of Winston, a 70-year-old colon cancer survivor who called in to share his experience with persistent pain in his abdominal area. Despite visiting multiple doctors and undergoing various tests, Winston had not received a clear diagnosis or effective treatment. Dr. Gardner offered to examine Winston and help him explore possible causes of his pain, highlighting the importance of persistence and advocacy in seeking medical care.

Throughout the conversation, Dr. Gardner emphasized the importance of being aware of one's body and seeking medical attention when something feels off. He encouraged listeners to take charge of their health and not hesitate to seek help when needed. The discussion was informative, engaging, and inspiring, leaving listeners with a greater understanding of pyomyositis and the importance of prioritizing their health.
