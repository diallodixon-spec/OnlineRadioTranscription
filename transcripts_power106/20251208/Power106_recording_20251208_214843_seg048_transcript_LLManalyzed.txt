============================================================

The traffic was so noisy that you could not hear my cry. I gave you my love in vain. My body never knew such pleasure. My heart never knew such pain. And you, you leave me so confused Now I'm all cried over you Over you, all over you Never wanted to see things your way I had to go astray Why was I such a fool?
