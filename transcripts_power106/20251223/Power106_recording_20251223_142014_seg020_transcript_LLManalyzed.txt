20251223 142014 Thank you so very much for that, Richard. I take no credit for that. I credit my late aunt, Vivian Tomlin, who raised me well. I have more than one mother, and I do. In my family, I have two mothers, my mother who gave birth to me, who I now take care of, and my late aunt who raised me. And the kinds of values with which we were raised makes it very easy for us to operate in whatever space we find ourselves with that kind of approach. And it makes a difference because it makes it easier for you to have conversation. And we're not telling you that we don't get vexed like some people do you know because we have times when we get vexed right right but it is how you handle everything going forward that makes a difference yes so
