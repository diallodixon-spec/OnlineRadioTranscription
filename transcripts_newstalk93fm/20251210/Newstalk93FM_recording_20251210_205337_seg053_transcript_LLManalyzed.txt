When you speak to me, I hear a song Every word you say feels like a poem I will take you with me everywhere Listen to you every day Oh, oh, my sweet inspiration When I feel like I can't do what I'm supposed to And I can't even pick myself up When you speak to me, I hear a song. Every word you say feels like a poem. I will take you with me everywhere.
