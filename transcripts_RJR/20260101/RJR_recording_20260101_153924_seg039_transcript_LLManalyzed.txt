But Hansi was the one who produced it. But he sold the tape, them time there, we don't have the money, you know, so you have to make the money, just sell it and then sell it. And then so, so I'm calling the session now. So he come and say, come you you should like, I'm using like a right hand money and I knew where I'm gonna go. Okay. Well, it's like, I'm saying, all right, I'm gonna come. So I'm taking this day, I'm supposed to go out some week, you know. I'm saying, I want to go to the restaurant tonight, I want to finish for a little bit. Map it out, I'm gonna map it out, man. And the lightbox that play guitar, them ten, the lightbox take up the guitar. We work with a real car, real printer. That's why I'm still so wicked, you know. So, we book the session now.
