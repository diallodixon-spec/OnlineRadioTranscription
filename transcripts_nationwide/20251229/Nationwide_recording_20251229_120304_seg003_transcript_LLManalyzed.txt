20251229 120304 As at December 27 this year, 666 people have been killed across the island. This is the first time since 1996 that fewer than 1,000 Jamaicans have been murdered in a calendar year. Police divisions in western Jamaica have contributed significantly to the reduced murder tally across the country. Leading the decline is Area 1, which consists of the Trelawny, St. James, Hanover and Westmoreland Police Divisions. Police Commissioner Dr. Kevin Blake notes that these divisions account for the greatest source of reduction in this part of the country represented the largest contributor to increased violence statistics. This year, era one, led by ACP Glenn Miller, represents the greatest source of reduction. Across the western parishes, murders and shootings have been reported.
