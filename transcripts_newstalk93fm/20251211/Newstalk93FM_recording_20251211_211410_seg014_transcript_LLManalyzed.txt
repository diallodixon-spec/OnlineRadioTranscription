That's when I need you the most That's how I get right Baby, if I'm safe in your arms, I feel safe Saved like the money let it sit up in a bank Saved like a cold with the alarm, I feel safe My body got right by my side, so I don't need a rich To somebody that can make me feel safe yeah look I don't want a couple but nobody ever made me feel safe like you facts cause when I'm with you I just know I'm fine you take all the pressure off my mind all the time patient in time will not be going out my mind safe from the problems I don't worry cause I'm hard to find
