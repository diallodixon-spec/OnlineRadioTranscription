20251217 115328 Wonderful, merciful Savior Precious Redeemer and Friend Who would have thought that a lamb could rescue the souls of men? Oh, you rescue the souls of man. New every morning is Thy love. Our awakening and uprising prove. Lord, every single time that You give us another day, You're really giving us opportunities to change, to improve, and to turn our hearts to You. You're so loving, Father. You're so forgiving, so loving.
