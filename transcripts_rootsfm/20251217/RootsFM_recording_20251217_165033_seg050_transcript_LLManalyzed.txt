I was at walkin' A little young girl I was seein' I see a young girl, she started smiling. I walk over, we started talking. I said, hi, babe. She said, how are you keeping? I said, I'm cool. I'm just doing my own thing. She said, hey, man, I hear you are the ending. Your tip for Ivy from that sax and sax system. I said, babe, this is my first time in following. She said, how about we just make it interesting? I said, there's one thing I want to do, my darling. We can go home and have a quiet evening and have a meal, you know, that's very finger licking.
