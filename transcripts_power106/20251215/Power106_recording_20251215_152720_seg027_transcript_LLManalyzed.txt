20251215 152720 So what, the problem is the house or the problem is the size? What's the problem? The size, the size. So what does the size of the house have to do with it? Well... Anyway, I won't go into that part. This isn't a building house, at least he's an ambitious young man, but he built a mansion. Alright, so you can work about the things for him to get the piece. Alright. Okay, thank you very much. Okay, you're welcome. And I want to encourage persons, don't build on property unless you have a title. Okay, because I think you have done your uncle a disjustice, you know, in terms of going to put up the holes without getting, you know, his proper permission and taking more land than he has given. What has happened already?
