20251224 172310 I don't need to end my stocking. Live upon the fireplace. Santa Claus won't make me happy. With a toy I'll miss today. I just want you for my own. More than you could ever know. Make my wish come true. All I want for Christmas with you, you, baby. Oh, I won't ask for much this Christmas. I won't even wish for snow. And I just want to keep on waiting. Oh, don't leave the mistletoe. I won't make a list and send it to the North Pole for sending. I won't even stay awake till the magic rain is clear, cause I just want you here tonight.
