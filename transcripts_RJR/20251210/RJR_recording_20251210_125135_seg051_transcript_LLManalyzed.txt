You will never know to do for yourselves That is why you'll always need aid in good times and bad times. For your information, Jamaica has per square kilometer, not miles, a higher density of resource material, a higher rare earth material. Take a look at the modern devices in front of you. Guess what the stuff to build it comes from. Precious
