============================================================

Here in your arms I found my paradise My only chance for happiness And if I lose you now, I think I would die So you'll always be my baby, we can make it shine We can take a ride, we're just remaining out of town More than a woman More than a woman to me More than a woman There are stories old and true People so in love like you and me And I can't see myself Let history repeat itself
