From every whisper to every commotion. That's rubbish. The KSAMC cannot investigate itself. Every news story unfolds here first at Nationwide 90FM, the new revolution in media. Every sound is a story and every from Flow. Due to a malicious act of vandalism, there has been extensive damage to Flow's infrastructure, which has impacted internet, cable and landline services for businesses and residential customers in the New Kingston and surrounding area. Technical teams are working to restore these services as quickly as possible. Flow regrets any inconvenience caused and thanks its customers for their understanding. That was a public service announcement from Flow.
