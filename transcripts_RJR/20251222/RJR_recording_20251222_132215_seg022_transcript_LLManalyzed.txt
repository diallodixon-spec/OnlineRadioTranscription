Yes. Put up in here you know. Two Life Crew is all about Christmas this week. I hope that is the same for you. I don't know if it's the same for you, not everybody actually celebrates Christmas time. Some people, the religion don't really allow you to celebrate Christmas time. But if that's the case, then just enjoy the fact that it's a cheerful time. It's a cheerful time of the year, a time for family. We all can celebrate that. Definitely, definitely, definitely. Because even if you're apart, even if you don't celebrate Christmas, generally your family is probably going to celebrate Christmas. That is true. It's kind of hard to ignore the season, right? Yes, yes, yes, yes. Especially Christmas Day when it's a day of food. Yeah, everybody's around.
