Because girl, you've got the real thing that all my bendin', even my feelings are so sure. I know it is you, girl. You, girl. The sunshine and the flowers, jealous of the power of you, girl, you, girl. Reasoning my heartbeat, we hit the bed with no sleep, oh, girl, oh, girl. Body like a blessing, say amen when you want just in front of me I'm losing all control. Girl, I can't fight this feeling. It's all right. Champagne and candlelight, they'll bring you hold me tight. Girl, I could fight this feeling.
