20251216 205535 La la la, oh lord, have mercy. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. A chance at least. It's going to be a good day. We're rocking from Sunday to Sunday. Look, now I miss how we moved. But just how I can move. Don't make me rock and move. No, no, that's how I move. I'm just a walk in the truth. Gonna make rock and groove. Them say, oh, yes, I show off. Oh, yes, I hype. Do you have liquor up your neck and all your life? Now, you're used to so fighting all day, all night. Oh, some of myself, I feel the rest of good life, step to keep up. I'm good to me, so I'ma lay back. You see the trouble, me I leave that in the mission.
