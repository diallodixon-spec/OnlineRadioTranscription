20251215 112013 Thank you so much. Thank you so much, Mr. Kevin. Yeah, we have to get to the point where we understand it's Christmas. No, Christmas. Mm hmm. Canada is on the line. Good morning, Canada. Good morning, Cliff. How are you? I'm good. Wishing you all the best for the season. And the same to you and your staff at NNN. Good. I was actually on TikTok the other night. But you know, I always have to come to the true source for information. And I was informed that there is a card that is issued in a compound. And I would equate it when I was asking a couple of questions.
