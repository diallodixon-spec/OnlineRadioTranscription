You saved me, so I can come back to Aki Village to buy more breadfruit. The Breadfruit Man. As you enter Aki Village, Johnny, and you swing left. I want Breadfruit Man. No, that's why I'm here. You swing left. And right in the corner there, so. Yeah. Send out his name to somebody. Because he asks me, you know. He says, Miss Daly, I never hear you big me up yet. But it's true, I call him the Breadfruit Man. But another time. 8-7-6-5-5-3. Help out, please. My week felt like I found money in her jeans. You know, you find money in a jeans or a pants packet. It's sweet. Suppose I tell you something. You remember first time if money in your clothes when you wash it, it done? Yeah man, the money done because of paper. You see that new B.O.J. nice money ah? Niceness. Oh gosh, let me wash something man.
