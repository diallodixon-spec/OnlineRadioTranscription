20260102 123422 stop killing. Good morning hotline, please can you tell the people with the bright light on their vehicles that it can cause accidents, not only the phone, the light all in the day. Please something has to be done, God help us. So it's on all of these vehicles. So yes, driving and using the phone is one thing, but the bright lights create problems as well. All right, someone says, good day Mr. Earl, greetings to all the RJR staff. I would like all Jamaicans to stop throwing the rubbish on the ground and keep Jamaica clean. Rosalie says Happy New Year Mr Earl, one thing Jamaicans need to stop doing is disposing of their garbage
