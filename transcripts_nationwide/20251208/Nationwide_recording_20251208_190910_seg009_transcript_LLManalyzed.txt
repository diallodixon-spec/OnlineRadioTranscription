It's a densely populated city like New York. How do you see what the Mayor-elect's saying here, the advice he's giving legally? What sort of confrontations may be ahead? Well, first of all, I agree with what Mayor-elect said. He specifically said a judicial warrant. There's a thing called an administrative warrant issued by the agency itself, which is basically, I hereby authorize myself to go into some place. You need a judicial warrant to go into a home. And I want to add that there are a number of different ways people can be lawfully present in this country. You're a citizen, you're a lawful permanent resident, you've been paroled into this country, you're a DACA recipient, you have asylum. So there are number of different ways someone can be lawfully present, not eligible to be swept off the streets by ICE and put into detention. You're right. New York City is a much, much different place than any of the other places ICE has targeted.
