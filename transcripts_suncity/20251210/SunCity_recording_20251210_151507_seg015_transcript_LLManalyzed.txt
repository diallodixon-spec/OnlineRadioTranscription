============================================================

I'll be free. Only him know how we get through. Every day we donate, I give the price. I'm a leg we have to pay. While our leaders blend, Mr. Who can afford to run will run. But what about those who can't? They will have to stay. Opportunity has here's here's come a detail. In this time I say, when momma spend a lass And send you the class Never you ever play It's a competitive world for low budget people Spending the time while earning in the earth With no regard to who it may tickle My cup is full to the brim I could go on and on, the fool has never been told. While I'm living, thanks I'll be giving.
