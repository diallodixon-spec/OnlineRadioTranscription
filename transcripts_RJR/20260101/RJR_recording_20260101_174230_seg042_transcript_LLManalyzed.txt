20260101 174230 When the rain hits a path on the roof Herb just a steamed pepper pot on the skew Life is a dream if you got gratitude So go tell the regime they can't stop where we do now Information you think on your own Or else you're a slave to the things that you know What do you know if you learn every day So be careful of things where you say Who knows, who knows, who knows I just go work at trade windows Sending love to my friends and foes And I suppose I'm pleased to be chilling in the West Indies
