2025-12-12 15:25:48 I couldn't see the sky Sometimes when I'm standing It seems I got involved for miles And my heart could be crying It's in the middle of a smile But then I climbed the hills and saw the mountains I hollered help cause I was lost Then I felt the strong wind With a small voice saying the storm is over Storm is over now I can see the sunshine Somewhere beyond the clouds I feel heaven, heaven is over me Come on and set me free I don't wanna go another day So I'm telling you exactly what is on my mind
