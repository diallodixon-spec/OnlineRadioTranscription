I hear your voice even though you're really not there. Over and over there's a vision of you in my life. When I look out my window each night, I think about you more than twice. Let me love you, please you, and do all the things that you want me to do. Let me touch you, yes, kiss you, and show you what I feel inside my heart. My unforgettable dream. Unforgettable dream, you're the light of my life and you mean so much to me. My unforgettable dream You're the light of my life and you mean so much to me My unforgettable dream I wanna tell the world how much I love you My unforgettable dream
