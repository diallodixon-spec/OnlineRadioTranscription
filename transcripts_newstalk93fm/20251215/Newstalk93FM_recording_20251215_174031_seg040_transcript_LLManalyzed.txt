20251215 174031 I'm going to make the cherry on the top. It's heaven in my heart and we could find you some space. I could be the world to you, the missing piece, the extra sentimental kind of chemistry. Some people make it hard, but me that isn't the case. Cause I think it's so easy to fall in love So come give me a call and we'll fall into us I'm the perfect mix of Saturday night and the rest of your life Anyone with a heart would agree It's so easy to fall in love when the way I do my hair, the way I make you laugh, the way we like to share a walk in Central Park. I could be fresh air, might be the girl of your dreams.
