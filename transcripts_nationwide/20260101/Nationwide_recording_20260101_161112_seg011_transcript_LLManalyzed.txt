20260101 161112 You keep me rockin' all of the time Red, red wine, you make me feel so grand I feel a million dollar when you're just in me hand Red, red wine make me feel so sad Anytime I see you go, it make me feel bad Red, red wine you I give you one leap a zing One leap a zing, let me do my own thing Red red wine, we're building a home for love You're kind of loving like a blessing from above Red red wine I love you right from the start Right from the start, with all of my heart Red red wine in an 80's style Red red wine in a modern beat style Give me a little time, let me clear up my mind Give me liquid wine, let me clear out my mind Give me red wine, be kind, let me feel fine Let me feel fine, all of the time Red, red wine, it make me feel so fine
