Newer LED type bulbs generate significantly less heat and are generally safer for household use. Another fire safety tip is to avoid overloading the circuit. The situation with Christmas lights is that they have a plug-in, all of them provide a plug-in. What that does is that if you are not careful it leads to overloading of a circuit. So no more than three sets of lights should be plugged in at any time into one socket. Remember to turn off the lights when you are leaving the house. The lights are for your enjoyment. You are leaving the space. Unplug the lights. You don't want a situation where something starts and nobody's there.
