All right, so Sandra over there in Mandeville says I had KFC in Florida and I couldn't finish it Jamaica is the best no joke All right to look like Jamaica lead no surprise there well it looked like the Caribbean is leading because I heard great things about Guyana. I've been hearing good things about Trinidad. I've been here and I just found out that Barbados also has great KFC and Costa Rica. Man, so it look like this region knows how to do KFC the right way. Alright Chris in Atlanta says I carry up goat meat and fish from Jamaica to US.
