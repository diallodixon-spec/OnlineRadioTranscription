20260101 104835 This is my decision, decision. This is my decision, decision This is my decision I don't think you'll listen, you'll listen I don't you'll listen For me to come out, it must mean I'm out the door It It must mean I'm nothing same. It must mean, I'm on your case. For me to go out, it means that I'm not the girl. I want to show you my world. Give me one break, I need faith, faith to believe.
