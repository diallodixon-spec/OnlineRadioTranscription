20251230 115035 One of the things that happened was that the methodology of the calculation of GDP was changed. One of the most important changes is that they changed the base year from 2007 to 2015, which means that they eliminated a whole lot of the inflation, so they reduced the size of the GDP deflator, so you get a higher real rate of growth. So we want people to understand that we have nominal GDP, which is GDP before adjustment for inflation or deflator. And we have the adjusted. Yeah, the deflator is a measure of both consumer and producer prices. So when you move it from 7 to 15, you cut out a whole lot of that. So we've got 1.1, 1 1.6 right that's up to the second quarter right we haven't gotten the third quarter thing yet the PIOG had estimated that it was about 4% we never got anything from starting in relation to that up comes Melissa in October
