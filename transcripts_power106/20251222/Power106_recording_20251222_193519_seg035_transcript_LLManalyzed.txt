20251222 193519 This weather was ideal on Sunday at the championship? Pardon? The conditions were a little bit challenging at certain points of the day because wind changes affect the way the waves break and there were a lot of squalls passing through on the day. So we had heavy winds and then the wind would die down for a bit and then get heavier again. So as a surfer, we are used to having to adapt to these conditions and change using conditions. So it wasn't really much of a challenge in that aspect. So I would say we had really good conditions. It was consistent.
