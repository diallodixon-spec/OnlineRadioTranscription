20260102 091208 the Lord is watching over me and and I felt that protection and I always remember that once you preach and talk good words, it will happen. So, um I remember in the music business for years and years and all of the suffering and the struggling and in 2000, I said, you know, I'm going to change my name. I'm a go. So, I'm a change my name and say, you know, you know, at the time, they were calling me Lady. I'm a say, I'm a new name. I'm what a new name. A time for me. Now, I'm start telling myself, you say, I'm going to and I'm suffer too long and I go through the whole journey and I see so much artists come and go and you know, I might turn out and you know, in the 2000, I changed my name and and call myself and during that time, when I call myself, you know, what happened? I started to pray a lot, you know. I'm going to go home and I'm going to promise God, I'm going to say, God, if any of you make me boss, I'm always going to be kind to people. I'm always about loving that, and anything you want me to do, I'm gonna do, and you know, I'm always, I'm gonna wish this money thing
