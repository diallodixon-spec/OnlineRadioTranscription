============================================================

you're assessing them on, and sometimes it brings into sharp focus one's job title as well. Are persons doing the job assigned to them, or are they doing another job? So even as you work out, and this is just my view here, as I'm trying to get through to Mr. Finlayson to flesh out a bit more what's happening in the public sector, but even if you are performing, but if you're not performing the role in which you are so hired, then you may well find that your performance is falling short. Not just telling lack of effort on your part, but because of lack of direction and of course the role which you are in, you are not fulfilling that role. It should be for another section. So all of these things are important, yes? And of course we will try and make connection again with Mr. Finlayson as we seek to get some clarity on a very important aspect of performance in the public sector.
