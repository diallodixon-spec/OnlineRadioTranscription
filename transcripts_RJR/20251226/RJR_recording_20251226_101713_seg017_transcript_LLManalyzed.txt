20251226 101713 Give the love from me to you. Sometimes, sometimes, let me be all on your cue. Give the smile, give the smile. Give the smile. This season, make sure everybody's good. Digital is everything to you. So, and it deals with the issues. It's Teacher's Time. Coming up in Teacher's Time, Sunday, December 28th, 2025. Join us as we hear from members of the support staff of both the JTA and the JTA Cooperative Credit Union as they reflect on the reason for the season, send their greetings, and look to the new year with promise. I'm sure being part of this great Sunday afternoon Teacher's Time program will be your pleasure.
