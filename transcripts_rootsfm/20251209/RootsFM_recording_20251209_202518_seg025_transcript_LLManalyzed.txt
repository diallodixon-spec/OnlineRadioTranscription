Oh, no, the youths them ballin' out. The youths them callin' out. Well, justice is where the youths them need overall. The way them deal with mankind, all mcgall start ballin'. Justice is where the youth them need overall, the way they deal with mankind. Listen, now I'm on the set, Jack and Jill went up the hill to sell some marijuana. Puck up the freddy, broke Jack's account and Jill came tumbling after. Think about beef shit after sheep to thief in the pasture. And if one tried it after again, it's going to bring disaster. Kings and kings are the lords of lords, everlasting, everlasting. Inspire Dianite to be a microphone laster. Men are gonna bow down to no safe mass. Let the youth in person ask the questions themselves.
