We give it all we got We finally left the table And what a simple thought You're starving till you're not And all of the folks and all of the friends Have messed up before, they'll mess up again Life is a song, it ends when it ends move on. And that's when I told you it's all right. You were dancing through the lightning strikes. Sleepless in the onyx night. But now the sky is all my light. Oh, oh, oh, oh. Oh, my lord. Never met no one like you before. You had to make your own sunshine. And now the sky is all for light. Oh, this is just the beginning.
