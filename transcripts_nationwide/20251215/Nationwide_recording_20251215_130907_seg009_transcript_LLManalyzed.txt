20251215 130907 that maybe you would have seen in the circuit court that might be affecting the time adjudication of matters. So what are those challenges? All right. If I might, you know, I like to do a little history before I go to the matter. So if you could give me a little bit of time so that your listeners will understand what it means, what, what, how it operates and therefore what are the real challenges that the courts are going to experience. Am I permitted to do that? Please do. All right, so first of all, the history of this court, the circuit court, is rooted in English common law. And the courts were modeled on the English aseis, where judges travel to different parishes to hear the case, right? So this system of itinerary judges laid the foundation of what had become our circuit court system. And it is designed to ensure an unwell access to justice. So the purpose of it was to bring justice closer to the rural parishes and reduce the need for litigants to travel to Kingston.
