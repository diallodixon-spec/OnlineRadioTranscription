20251231 192216 Jamaican food or meal? I don't want to sound cliche, but the first thing I want to eat is KFC. You are reinforcing this idea that Jamaican KFC is the best. Yes, I went to Trinidad, their KFC is not that great. In the US, K., KFC is less than stellar. So, Curry Goat and KFC, how's that? Oh gosh, you're putting me in trouble now. Because I would want to say Spice, but the church people gonna beat me up. I love Spice, but I would want to say Kevin Downswell. That's a safe choice. That's a save choice. Especially as a politician. I know, right? Okay, all right. So thank you so much, unless there's something you want to add that I haven't asked about.
