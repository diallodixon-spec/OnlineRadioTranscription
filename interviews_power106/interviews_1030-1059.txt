**Interview 1: Michael Leckie, Past President of the Small Business Association of Jamaica and Farmer**

In a recent interview on Power 106 FM, Michael Leckie, past president of the Small Business Association of Jamaica and a farmer, expressed his concerns about the 5.1% GDP recovery recorded in the third quarter of last year. Leckie stated that the growth is not sustainable and that the government needs to stimulate the economy. He also questioned the accuracy of the 5.1% figure, suggesting that it may be an exaggeration. Leckie emphasized the importance of agriculture in driving economic growth, but noted that it is not being given the attention it deserves.

Leckie's comments came as a response to the government's announcement of the 5.1% GDP recovery, which he believes is not a true reflection of the country's economic situation. He argued that the government needs to focus on economic growth and not just public relations. Leckie also expressed his concern about the debt-to-GDP ratio, which he believes will continue to rise if the economy does not grow.

**Interview 2: Lucius Wright, Veteran Public Commentator**

In another interview on Power 106 FM, Lucius Wright, a veteran public commentator, discussed the recovery of the Jamaican economy. Wright emphasized the importance of understanding the reality of the situation, rather than just believing what is being reported. He noted that the 5.1% GDP recovery is not a true reflection of the country's economic situation and that the government needs to focus on increasing productivity and efficiency.

Wright also stressed the need for the government to diversify its trading partners and to invest in areas such as climate-resilient infrastructure, scientific agriculture, and renewable energy. He warned that if the government does not take these steps, the country will continue to struggle economically.

**Interview 3: Unnamed Guest**

In a third interview on Power 106 FM, an unnamed guest discussed the need for the government to provide opportunities for young people in Jamaica. The guest noted that many young people are talented and have the potential to make a positive contribution to the country, but are being held back by a lack of opportunities. The guest emphasized the importance of education and agriculture in providing opportunities for young people and in driving economic growth.

The guest also expressed concern about the impact of anti-immigration policies on Jamaicans living abroad and the need for the government to provide support for those who are affected. The guest stressed the need for the government to be honest with itself and with the people about the challenges facing the country and to work towards finding solutions.
