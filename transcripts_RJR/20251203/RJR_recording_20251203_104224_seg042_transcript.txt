No service. No service at all. Sparling. that too all right oh I'm reading I'm seeing a text here from an adjoining district anyway about it so yes I'm gonna do a follow-up on that one yeah to see what's going on here thank you sir all right good good blessings not to mention I see another one here as well not from the same area
