20260102 191721 Years ago, the 2nd of January, 1985, West Indies' greatest captain bowed out of test cricket. The great Sir Clive Lloyd played his last test match against Australia at the Sydney Cricket Ground. At age 40, Lloyd made 72 in his final innings and the West Indies lost the match. However, the series was won 3-1 by the West Indians and they kept hold of the Sir Frank Warren trophy that's the trophy that's played between these two teams exclusively. Lloyd was one of the most outstanding leaders in the history of the game. He was at the helm when the West Indians became the most successful team of all time. Lloyd had a career with numbers that defined greatness. He played 110 test matches, scored 7,515 runs at an average of 46.7, including 19 centuries. A giant of the game, a leader of legends.
