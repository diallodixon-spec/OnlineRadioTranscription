Welcome to Power Play. My name is Keith Williams. Yes. Good evening. Thanks for having me. Yes. And I get particularly excited being a coach myself with a few championships. With you, I quote, what a way to start the record girls qualifying during an absolute demolition of Dominica 18 nil. The biggest margin ever in the Jamaica World Cup qualifier from Bullishaw returning with a hat-trick to be 16 at the goal. It's good. Tony Brown, Kalysha Van Zanten, and several others timed in the back of the net. So it was a performance filled with confidence, discipline, and real intent. So tonight, coach, you want to delve a little bit deeper into all of this, but let's start here. What was your immediate reaction to the team's execution and overall performance? Start there for us, please. Yeah, well, I think first and foremost, it started with the week. I mean, they arrived in good condition.
