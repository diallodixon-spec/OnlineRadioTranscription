I know how you make me feel for you and Each and every day I try to make some sense of it What you mean to me I know it could be serious Each and every night I dream about just holding you Why don't you like that? What is a girl supposed to do? I love you. I want you. You're the one that I live for. And I can't take it anymore. I love you.
