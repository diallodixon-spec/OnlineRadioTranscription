Give me a break, baby. We need to be with you. You are now live in the mix. It's DJ Stray. I feel the shivers. It's down and out. I'm a dreamer. It's all about. I know it's not the flu. It all because of you I feel it trembling when I wake Come back and give another beret I feel a shiver Running up my spine This hurting, hurting feeling It hits me all the time Every time you go away Seems I can't live another day Oh, my bed, it is so cold You've got my happiness on hold Oh, I feel a ton of joy And my heart gets warm
