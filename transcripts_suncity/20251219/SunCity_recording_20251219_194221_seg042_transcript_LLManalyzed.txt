20251219 194221 Sun City Radio, we run the block. We have Portmore and Kingston lock. By the end of the year, we're going to have country lock. I lock the whole island and we're going up on top. You know we must get the number one spot. They can't start Sun City Radio. Because if you're fed up with the I, let them go. And if you fed up with the Z, who's off, you let them move. And if the F's not moving, who's off you let them move? And if the H's not touching, who's off let them move? Sun City Radio, people know me as Mr. Lex. Lex. You need to call me Joseph Dawkins, otherwise known as QQ. Sun City Radio, who else you want? This is Baby Man, the king of all the DJs. And so... Sun City! Yeah, you know, they are the boss every single day. Sun City, emperor, emperor of government, you know. Sun City!
