Dr. Tufton notes that healthcare workers from other regions of the island have been redeployed to Western Jamaica, where they are now providing on-the-ground support. He added that authorities have already dismantled the field hospital in Falmouth, Trelawny. Meanwhile, the field hospital in Black River St. Elizabeth is to be relocated from the Black River High School to the grounds of the Black River Hospital. Minister of Health and Wellness Dr. Christopher Tufton says the decision was taken as the Black River Hospital is gradually restoring its services and relocating the field hospital will ensure patients receive continuous care. The team expects to complete the relocation by December 14. The intention here is to consolidate services given that the Black River facility is now cleaned up. Some services are going to be restored there and the staff are better able to coordinate the management of patient care at the same geographic location. That, we believe, is the best approach. We are in the process of training our local team working with the JDF for that relocation.
