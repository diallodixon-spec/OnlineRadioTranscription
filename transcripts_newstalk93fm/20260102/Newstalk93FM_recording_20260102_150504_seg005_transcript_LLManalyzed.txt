20260102 150504 So clear. I don't know about you but I come here to fight Come to play a match I'm not leaving until I wet Come to play a mass I don't live my life with regrets No, I come to jam jam on a bumper, come to trip on a level. All the money grown, I'm causing trouble. Look how the security watch me, they don't know I'm out there. And it's much a big place under the sun.
