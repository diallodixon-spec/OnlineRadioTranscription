Yesterday I was speaking to mr. Mullins, but there and then I never get to say my part that I have to say so maybe start it all over again. What is your intake with that? statement that mr the opposition leader opposed to Mr. Vaz the other day, and why did he speak of the house, of how he had treated the thing there, like her bedroom, with the opposition? That's inappropriate. That's inappropriate though, but hear me now. I believe that Mr. Vaz has a tendency to be a little bit too strident whenever he's being criticized and he needs to chill. Plain and simple.
