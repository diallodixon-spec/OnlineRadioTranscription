Baby you're all that I want When you're lying here in my arms Finding it hard to believe We're in heaven Love is all that I need And I found it there in your heart It isn't too hard to see we're in heaven Do you ever think about me? Do you ever cry yourself to sleep in the middle of the night when you awake?
