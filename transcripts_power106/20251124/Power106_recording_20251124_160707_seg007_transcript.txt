============================================================

face like wolf in sheep clothing and you know it's you're praying to God to have one, I think a one-day prayer or so. God's not going to hear them. Wasting time. Because if you pray to God, the first thing you have to do, the government, they have to come together, the opposition, repent and confess. Let them sin and allow the people to do the same. You mean the politicians, the political class? Both of them have to come and confess to the country and God and repent and then the country do the same. We can't start up there. Away from that.
