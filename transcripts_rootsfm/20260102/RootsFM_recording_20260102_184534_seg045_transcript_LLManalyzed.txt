20260102 184534 She loves me now She loves me now And I sing glory, glory, hallelujah Got to give thanks and praise unto the Father A long time I've been with my little daughter She loves me now She loves me now After me talk to the mother and the father Send love letters with the brothers and sisters Then me talk how I can get the data But she don't know a nutty good luck stick over She loves me now, whoa, she loves me now, uh-huh.
