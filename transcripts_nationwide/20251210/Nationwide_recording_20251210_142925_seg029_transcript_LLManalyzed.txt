You have to believe me when I speak, boy You see in this life you got to practice what you preach, oh It's no secret, me love the ladies today, great Girl, come in like a scripture Style and pattern, we killing them with the beat, them bad Out and clean like a prison of workers, switch up a simple mat We not from the dead, we burn, no exaggeration Your ration, your skillet, make we show them how we do it now. We do what we can do it easier, I drop in my partner neck in a freezer, skillet pull up inna the G-Wag, make every girl happy say Jesus, mad man she love. I pop up inna your speaker like a media, when you wanna feel that, Jesus.
