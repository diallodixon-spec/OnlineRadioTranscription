20251226 101914 Keep it in the 60s. Rock steady now. So we move from ska. And we're gonna get into a little bit more easy, steady kind of groove. What do you say already now? 19 after 10 is our time. So happy to have you on board on a Friday morning like this. It's a holiday and so we are in the music. We're gonna keep it coming at you until we get up to the one o'clock hour. Don't forget we have the news from the Radio Jamaica News Center when we get up to 12. So if you're just joining, we want to welcome you. I want to say good morning to all the people over by Rocky Point, the southern section of Clarendon. And we want to reach up into the Frankfield area.
