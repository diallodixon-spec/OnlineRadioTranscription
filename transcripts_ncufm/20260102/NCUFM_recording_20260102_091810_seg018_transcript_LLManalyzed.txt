20260102 091810 history. It is a personal promise. Just as Noah was raised up to bring relief, God raises up comfort in our lives, right where we feel the strain. Today I want us to declare these things over our lives. Toil will not define me. Struggle will not consume me. And God has already spoken comfort over me. Lord, thank you for the promise of comfort in the midst of toil. Just as you raised Noah to bring relief Lord, raise up the rest in my life today. Teach me to trust your redemption, to lean into your peace and Lord teach me to walk in the assurance that you are my comforter.
