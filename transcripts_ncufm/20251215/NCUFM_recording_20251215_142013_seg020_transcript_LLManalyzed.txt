20251215 142013 Always bettering It's the greatest thing Loving I'm walking in my purpose In my destiny Moving by His Spirit No chains are me. You change the way I'm thinking, the music to my song. Change the way I'm walking, I'm no more alone. Never more will I turn to the left or right Never will it stray away from the one who gave his life It was for me he paid the price
