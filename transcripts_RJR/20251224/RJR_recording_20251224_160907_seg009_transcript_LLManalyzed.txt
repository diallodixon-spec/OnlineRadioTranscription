20251224 160907 Believe me, I do. I apologize. Honest and true. Because I know I was wrong. And so I save you this soul. And I'm trying to get through. And make it up to you. Operator, it was like a bad dream. The Lord just should have heard the way he shouted at the world and he screamed. I regret it, because I was unfair. I took it all out on him not just because he was there. When the road gets rough, you say things you shouldn't have said. I never meant to treat my dad the dead way. I apologize.
