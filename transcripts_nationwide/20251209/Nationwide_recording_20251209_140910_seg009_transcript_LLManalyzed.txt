The smell of your perfume I thought I was immune Looking around this room Can't help but see the traces of you This moment is surreal I can't put into words how i feel oh twin where have you been nobody knows me like you do nobody gonna love me quite like you can't even deny it every time time I try When I get my eyes you know I'm lying, lying Body to body, skin to skin I'm never gon' learn like this again Just for me
