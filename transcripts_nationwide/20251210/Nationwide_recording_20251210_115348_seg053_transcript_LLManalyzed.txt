I heard it for the first time one Sunday morning I went to a wholesale my granny said I'm going to shop and you know when you line up on your way to get served and children, there are all kinds of hijinks going on and all kinds of things. And she came and a couple of the boys were there and they blurted it out. And, listen, I'm not making fun of anybody. I'm relaying a tale to you from my childhood, right? When it was said, the whole, whole seals, everybody will start laughing, even the big people. Yeah? And she don't pay no mind to stand up in the line and say I'm buying what she's buying. I don't pay no no mind. But yeah.
