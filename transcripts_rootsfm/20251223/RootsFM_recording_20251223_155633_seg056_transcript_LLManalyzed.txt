20251223 155633 I wanna feel the heat with somebody Yeah, I wanna dance with somebody With somebody who loves me I've been in love and lost my senses Spinning through the town Sooner or the fever ends, and I wind up feeling down. I need a man who'll take a chance on a love that burns hot enough to last. So when the night falls, my lonely heart calls. Oh, I want to dance with somebody for Christmas.
