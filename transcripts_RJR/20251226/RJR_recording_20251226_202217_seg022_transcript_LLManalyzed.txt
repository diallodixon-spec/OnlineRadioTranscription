20251226 202217 Happy, happy, happy. My life is happy. Happy, happy happy. I'm more than happy. I am living it up. And I'm singing it now. I'm not giving it up up so we don't have no time with them if you're feeling blessed, blessed, blessed jump up and say yes if you're feeling bad, stop and see your son or two down. Happy, happy, happy. My life is happy. Happy, happy happy. I'm more than happy. Things in my cup are happy. And the girls of our cup are happy.
