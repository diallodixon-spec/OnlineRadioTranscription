2025-12-12 03:22:48 presentation. Join me, your host Roy Black, every Saturday between 6 p.m. and 11 p.m. for this unique show right here on Who's 96.1 FM as we continue this musical journey that links the past to the present time. This past week, the world lost one of its most iconic entertainers in the person of Dr. Jimmy Cliff. Next to Bob Marley, it can be argued that he was Jamaica's most impactful and influential recording artist and screen personality. Join host Roy Black inside the spotlight hour of The Saturday Night Alternative this coming Saturday at 8 p.m. as he looks at the life and works of Jimmy Cliff. Be sure to join us.
