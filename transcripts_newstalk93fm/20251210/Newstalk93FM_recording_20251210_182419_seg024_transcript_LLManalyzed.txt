============================================================

Baby, I've traveled through the stars And many moons to find you Baby, the sugar on your skin The sweetest melanin, yeah See when you step out into the light And your body looking right No constellation in this sky could ever take your shine I'll travel a million miles just to look up on your smile Baby, look up to the clouds right now Say it to me, I will be around for the entire night See baby, while I'm close, I'll be here by your side You're doing doing things to me that I cannot deny. The way you're looking, girl, you are so certified. Put me back one time when you give me that fast wine, fast, fast wine, fast wine. Fast wine, fast, fine, fast wine. Take my boat to the dockside and anchor down by the bedside.
