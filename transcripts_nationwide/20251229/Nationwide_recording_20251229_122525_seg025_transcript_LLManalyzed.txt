20251229 122525 The Jamaican Dads podcast is all about providing men with a healthy, safe and functional forum to tackle many of the taboo topics that concern our masculinity. Like everyone else out there, we're dads of varying amounts of experience who come from different backgrounds and often view the world differently. We're definitely not perfect, but're all bridging and we're all committed to this piece of rock called Jamaica. Too often there are no safe spaces for men to explore the issues which are important to us. Plus most of the content out there about parenthood is produced by women for women so we think it is important that we be the change we want to see. Follow us on YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter at Jamaican Dads with a Z. And definitely join us here on Nationwide 90 FM every Thursday at 8 p.m. with a repeat on Sundays at 6 p.m. for the Jamaican Dads podcast. It's a revolution in media.
