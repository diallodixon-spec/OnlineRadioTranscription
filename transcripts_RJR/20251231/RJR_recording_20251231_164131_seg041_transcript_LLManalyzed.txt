20251231 164131 They can see the tears in our eyes But we don't have the pain that lies deep in our hearts Or maybe that's a pain we can't hide Cause everybody knows that we're both torn apart. Why do we hurt each other? Why do we push love away? Let's go wait till the water dries. No, no we may. When one shot or hearts pass us by. Let's don't wait till the water runs dry. We'll make the biggest mistake of our lives.
