20251231 144126 into January having a hydrate to heal challenge. We will be having a water challenge where we will be educating persons on how to drink your water, how much water to drink and all of that to stay on track because water is one of the simplest things but it is so powerful. That's one of the number one things I would definitely tell people. Start hydrating. A lot of times we think we're hungry but we're not. We're actually thirsty. The hunger center and the thirst centers in the brain are right beside each other. And sometimes we confuse the two. And a lot of times if we find that when we feel hungry we drink water, we're fine. We're no longer hungry all of a sudden. Because you really weren't hungry, you were thirsty. But because every single time we feel a little thirsty, we run and grab something to eat and drink at the same time the body starts to say oh grab something to eat so this is one small habit that I would encourage all of us if done consistently to drink water daily very very important drink water
