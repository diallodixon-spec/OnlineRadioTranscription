20251225 154628 All I want for Christmas is you. I don't want a lot for Christmas. There is just one thing I need. And I't care about the present Underneath the Christmas tree I don't need to end my stocking Live upon the fireplace Santa Claus won't make me happy With a toy I don't miss a thing I just want you for my own More than you could ever know Make my wish come true All I want for Christmas is you You, baby
