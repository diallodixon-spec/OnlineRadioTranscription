20251231 092413 and gloom. We may go to a party and feel like, oh, yes, it's nice. But when you go home and you're in a solitary place and you're by yourself, the entertainment you had can't sustain you no more. That time has passed. What are you going to do? And this is what the presence of God does. It comes. It's with you 24-7. It says, I'll never leave you nor forsake you. So you may boldly say, the Lord is my helper. I shall not fear what man shall do unto me and because Destruction is coming through man influenced by the devil, but we know we have authority over the works of the devil So we don't allow the doom and gloom to make us feel cast down We want to be people who have the joy of the Lord so we can stand and say no He has mended my broken hearted, right? My spirit is not feeling feeling like it's departed but my spirit is energized and it influences my soul and my body is going to reflect that so you can see my joy in my face in my actions in my behavior because i have the joy of the lord is my strength yes he has healed
