They ripped me off like false lashes and then threw me away And all the headshots on the walls of the dance hall Are of the witches who wish I'd hurry up I tried so I say I'm married to the hustle, and now I know the life of a showgirl, babe. And I'll never know another. Pain hidden by the lipstick and lips. Sequence of forever and now I know. The life of a show girl, babe. Wouldn't have it any other way.
