Do you know what you started? I just didn't hit a party. But now we're rocking on the dance floor, acting nutty. Your hands around my waist Just let the music play We're hand in hand, just to trust And now we face the fate I wanna take you away Let the tape into the music, digi Let it play I just can't refuse it Like the way you do Just keep on dropping to it Please don't stop the, please don't stop the music I wanna take you away Let the taping to the music DJ, let it play I just can't refuse it Like the way you do this Keep on rockin to it
