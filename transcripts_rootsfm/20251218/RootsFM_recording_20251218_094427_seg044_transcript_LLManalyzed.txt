20251218 094427 Listen to the birds when you hear them sing. Listen to the leaves all along the tree limb. Watch all the fishes in the sea when they swim. Every living thing I pick and heal the king. And all the water in the sea when they swim Every living thing I pick and heal the king And all the water from the spring, my sick eye Say all the wicked men will have to fall. And the righteous man will have his tent up. And the wrong man will have them knocked out. And hold them back against the wall. The wicked man fall but the righteous man stand.
