2025-12-11 18:24:11 I am tossing and turning in the night and I sleep again and again and again She's coming back, coming back and I know And I'm gonna love her better than before Yeah, she's coming back, coming back, and I know And I'm gonna lo-ver better than before I could not stand by me, but she wasn't listening She followed her friend, her company, and did her own thing Now she fuck up her things, I follow her friend and go away In my life, I come and I give her the world I gave her the diamonds and the pearls She's the one that I need and I love it to need
