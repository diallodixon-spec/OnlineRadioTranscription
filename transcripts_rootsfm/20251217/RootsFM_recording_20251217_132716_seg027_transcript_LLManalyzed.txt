20251217 132716 I'm not the kind of brother who'd be making mad ends I got myself a girl but we'd be kicking it as friends It's not enough, well maybe that depends again Not everything you want is everything you really need Just standing up society's motivated by greed Are you prepared to fall or tell me you're prepared to leave? So persevere and you'll succeed Keep Keeping it real. Gotta dig up all my peoples who'll be working on the future though they know they gotta struggle. Keeping it real So all my homies working on the nine to five and doing right to keep themselves up out of trouble. Keeping it real Although sometimes I know it seems impossible there ain't no need in drowning in your sorrow. Keeping it real If things are as bad as they can be you could be sure there'll be a brighter tomorrow All the harsh realities appear Still coming Tuesdays and threes Don't worry cause there'll be a better day One thing I can promise you Just keep on keeping on I swear to you there's gonna be a brighter day
