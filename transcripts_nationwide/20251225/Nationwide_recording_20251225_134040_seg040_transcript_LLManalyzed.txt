20251225 134040 Nowadays, some of us kids aren't quite sure what Christmas really is. Mommy and Daddy always told me that Christmas was a happy time, especially for kids. But now it seems that grown-ups have turned Christmas into one big shopping spree. When the best and most precious gift of all is within us, and it's free. That gift is love. Let's give lots of love to this Christmas and all's well that ends. May the universal love of Christ try and fold. So we can leave the pain of hating and misery behind us. You wish know, time and things will fade away. But the gift of love remains forever. Let love be your party.
