When did you first start cutting hair, man? Alright, it was in about 1998. I started cutting hair out of desperation. I needed a job. Bad. So you didn't cut hair before, though? Not professionally. I used to like my cousin and friends in my community. I used to cut them hair but I signed up with this agency. I look at job, went on an interview. Didn't get the job. Saw a friend of mine that we went school with and I see him well dressed up nice in a white shirt and in black. You know, me see him, me never so so clean so I kind of hide from him. So he see me and he say, hey lords, what's going on? So I go over to him and I talk and I say, why am I looking at work? I don't get it, you know. So he say, he's a barber, you know, I say a barber just like that. He say country, I say, yeah, man. So he carry me to the bar.
