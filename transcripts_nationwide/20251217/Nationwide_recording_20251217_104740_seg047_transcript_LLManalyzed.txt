20251217 104740 I just want to get you back to the rest of the year. Uh huh. I want to publicly thank you, Cliff, on behalf of the Labour Act bloggers. Oh. For the hard work that you did throughout the year. Especially during the election season. Thank you for choosing Jamaica. Go on. Go on. So people like you and George Davis who stand up and tell the people of Jamaica the facts and deserve the rumours and lies did a lot for the country.
