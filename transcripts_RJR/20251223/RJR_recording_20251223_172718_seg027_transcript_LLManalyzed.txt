So why won't people are needed to be fed, just send a chef who knows how to cook and who know how to cook to everybody? So what started us as a small organization is now all over the world. We are finishing the year with over 18 million meals served.

So for us it's just about doing what people and mankind should be doing together and cooking for persons that need the help.
