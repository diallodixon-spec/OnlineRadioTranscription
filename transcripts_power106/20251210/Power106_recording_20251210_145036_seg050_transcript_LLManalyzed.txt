Alright, I hear we have the pleasure of being joined online by Vincent Morrison, President of the Union of Clerical Administrative and Supervisor Employees on this Human Rights Day and of course, Michael Manley's birthday as well. Mr. Morrison, what a pleasure. Good afternoon. Thank you very much sir. Good afternoon to you and your listeners across the world for that matter. Yeah man across the world indeed. Thank you for joining us. Yes. A very important day in our history. In our aspect of our history whether it's political, economic, cultural, sports, whatever. And that tells you what sort of person Michael Manley was. I mean, tremendous. I had the pleasure of working with him several years at the NW. In fact, he was the person who employed me.
