20251212 160706 When the seas are troubled And then we all need someone My life I'm up No be smarting no more We all strive for more To live life in our comfort So forgive me if I fumble up Cause I'm only human Somebody move that I don't know You tell me to open box combo Always looking out my window Paranoid and confused I'm not sure anymore Always knocking at my door And so as the day comes, as I go on Protect me, Lord, I cannot trust my neighbours Be my saviour when the day comes, defend me
