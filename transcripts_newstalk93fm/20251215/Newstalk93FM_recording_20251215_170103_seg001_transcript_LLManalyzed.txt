20251215 170103 You're listening to Sleek Radio, 93 FM. You come alive with one wine, baby With you, I want to dance the night away One jam, turn a lifetime, baby So don't feel away You don't like the fast life Look on the bright side, girl I go take the blame I just want you to come and light it up Just a little winding up Come and meet me at the end of the truck and we rev it up All day, keep throwing it back at the way you stop
