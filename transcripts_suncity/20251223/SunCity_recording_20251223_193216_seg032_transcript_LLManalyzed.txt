20251223 193216 Gracias por escoger a escuchar el radio La Ciudad del Sol 104.9 FM. Radio con la diferencia. Thank you for choosing Sun City Radio 104 not all that matters to me. Mother, she can't find food to eat and them still not enough to share. Girl, overtime still can't get a dime and that not all the matters to me. Feelin' just about still can't see me try. That not all the matter to me. We need a little bit of play with a breakfast match or dinner.
