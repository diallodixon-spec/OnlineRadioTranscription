============================================================

We better stop fighting, better you win Cause baby I've hurt I'm so too many, many times before Now I know better It hurts To hold on to this kind of love Even more No, I'm not crazy I won't be a fool A fool for all love Cause I know I'd rather be alone Than be unhappy I'm gonna choose, choose for you Cause I know I'd rather be Alone than be unhappy
