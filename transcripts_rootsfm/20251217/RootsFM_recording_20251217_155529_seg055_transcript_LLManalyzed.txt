20251217 155529 You with the sad heart Don't be discouraged Still I realize It's hard to take courage In a world full of people You can lose sight of it all In the darkness No inside you make you feel so small But I see your true colors shining through I see your true colours And that's why I love you So don't be afraid to let them show your true colors. True colors are beautiful like a rainbow.
