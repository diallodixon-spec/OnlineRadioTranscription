20251223 161007 This is Tiffa, before you heard Ghost. So bad. Hello. Hello. Hello, why? Hello, why? I see no table, I see no food, I see no style. From your class, it's a lap of your collar, pop your collar, not happy. Ask all the rats out, the one you knock your hammer. Bust the broken moon feet and go for me. Mother, father, auntie, uncle, gate, and kiddo go to school.
