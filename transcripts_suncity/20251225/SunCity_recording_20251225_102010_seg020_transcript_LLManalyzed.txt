The love that she used to give me can't be found. I lost my way. She said she'd stay. And lately, I've been sleeping with a ghost. My stock is down and out. I used to be left my way and go. That was before the great depression kicked in and rocked us. And that was before the hurricane came in and stopped us. I told you to leave, but you lied to me when you said that. Maybe no worries, I promised to get us back. I'm sorry, just wouldn't do it. Our heart is obliterated. I'm trying to travel through, but it's like mountain mountains. It's like mountain mountains, hey. But I keep climbing and hoping things will change. And the sky turns red, and the water from the rain washes progress away. It's like moving mountains.
