20251224 104426 I have a lightning spirit Early in the morning I hat it Me cooler ready Me heist done ready Me punching that's automatic I have a lightning jumbie A kind of energy inside me And it ready for the rum Ready ready for the rum, ready ready for the rum ready for the action A spiritual encounter Kid my soul taking over Telling me to start up the drinking And do away with good behaviour So we out on the road now BOOM! It's Mars and Riddim and Sulker And a ready for the rum. Ready ready for the Rum Ready ready for therum. Ready for the rum, ready, ready for the rum Ready for the action, come! This sweating spirit havin' me feelin' good!
