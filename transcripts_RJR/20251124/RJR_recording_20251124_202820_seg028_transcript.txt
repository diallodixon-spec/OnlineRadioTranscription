============================================================

Just hold on to Jesus. And just ride out your Patrick, Mr. and Mrs. Beale. I'm so sorry to hear that, but this is just part of life. I know it's rough times right now, but ride out the storm as the song suggests, as the song says. I hope you find enough courage to now. Just hold on. We've got to do what we have to do.
