============================================================

When my sound play pictures lighters in the air You birds up in the street And that's just how it feels The music is sweet Singing Shag, we be killing this beat, yeah. Cause when satin high treacher, nobody not step. New clothes, new car, everything trep. Be a bossy walk in a design, a crook. Forward in a shelly bar until no molly come.
