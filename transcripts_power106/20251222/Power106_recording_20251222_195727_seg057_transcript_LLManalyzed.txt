20251222 195727 That's our program for today. We hope you enjoyed it as much as we enjoyed bringing it to you. My name is Dave Willam for inviting you to produce an agent with a technical mind and we are inviting you to join us tomorrow at 6 p.m. where we will endeavor to present yet another program of Power Playing Musically. And we leave you now with the third and final Christmas carol of the day, Celine Dion ye, O come ye to Bethlehem.
