============================================================

That's why I'm still in love with you Hold me close and look into my eyes And tell me you don't feel it too The way it used to be when we Don't look forever You and me together And we never really said goodbye We never really said it's over We never really said goodbye First love never dies When I saw you I could hardly speak You're just as beautiful as ever, babe Guess it's still the same mistake First love never dies Maybe youth is wasted on the young We can't go back but we'll go on
