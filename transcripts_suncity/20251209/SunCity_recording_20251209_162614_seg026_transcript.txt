You put it on the ground by the roadside You tend to get out your place to come inside Baby, don't do me that, you'll go break my heart Can't believe you're ready to give up on me just so Cause if you want me to go You gotta be looking the way you do You gotta be walking the way you do Because you're looking at me Boy, I come here to whine, I come to whine, my way's down low. I come out to whine, boy, I come here, to whine, and go down low. And let me show you how it tingles, and let me show you, how it tingles.
