20251218 092515 This is Your Radio Jamaica. You're now listening to Emily Shields' Talk With Substance on Hotline. Radio Jamaica, active for the good of our nation. Thank you, listeners. We're back with you on the hotline. So many things to cover today, so we're going to make sure that we get everybody in. My medical lead for this mission, pain to purpose, has been my sister, my friend, and the head of Rehabilitation Institute of the Caribbean, Dr. Paula Dawson. Morning to you, Doc. How are you? Good morning. Thank you, Amber. Well, how are you? Very, very good. Good to have you. Good to be here.
