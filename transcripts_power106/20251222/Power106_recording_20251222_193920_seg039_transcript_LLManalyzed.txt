20251222 193920 Going to these events and getting results and really putting the name on the map is already a big stride, not only for me, but for the sport itself overall in Jamaica. With more support from the Jamaican government, which we are getting, we just want to keep on getting those results into into a place where we're really proud of like we want to be on podiums we want to be waving the Jamaican flag high so I see coming we're ready my my friends are really pushing the level of surfing as well as people like Ivor Wilmot, Garen Price just to name a few Ronald Hastings so these are names to look out for in the sport of surfing, you know? In terms of improvement though, this is the best version of the Charmer we have seen so far. All of those athletes, harder than yourself.
