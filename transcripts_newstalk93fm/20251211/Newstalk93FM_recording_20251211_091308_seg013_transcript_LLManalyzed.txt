============================================================

indeed indeed indeed indeed this Christmas this Christmas very very lovely Christmas song there and of course as I said to you that for the rest of the year certainly while we're on you will be hearing a Christmas song at the beginning of the program here, straight up. Your mid-morning number one fix right here, and the big 93. And remember, I've been telling you to stick and stay with us, and the 93 FM, because we're coming bigger and better. Lots of offerings up and of course I'm sure you're hearing some jingles and you're saying what's going on there, what's sticking with us as we continue to get things going.
