No, I don't know. Nobody's gonna help me. See, on the weekend, they don't want me. I'm gonna go back and get them more breadfruit. I don't believe this. Johnny, when I see you, you're not gonna ask me, you know? Of course, because you're going right back to the breadfruit, man. What's a breadfruit, man? I call him... Oh, my God. What is it? Whitby? Minus 11. Minus five, minus one, minus five. You ask who gave him that name? We should proudly not just say, I gave it to him. His mother? His mother called him Tittie Man? We have the break coming up, isn't it? I'maggen, Mcquaggen. Johnny McQuaggen, McQuaggen.
