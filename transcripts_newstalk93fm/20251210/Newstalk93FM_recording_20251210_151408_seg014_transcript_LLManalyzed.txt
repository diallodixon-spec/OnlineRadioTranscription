You're starving till you're not And all of the foes and all of the friends Have messed up before, they'll mess up again Life is a song, it ends when it ends You move on And that's when I told you it's alright You were dancing through the lightning strikes Sleepless in the onyx night. But now the sky is all but light. Oh, my lord, never met no one like you before. You had to make your own sunshine. now the sky is all for light This is just a star inside a teacup That shelter here with me, my love Thunder like a drum
