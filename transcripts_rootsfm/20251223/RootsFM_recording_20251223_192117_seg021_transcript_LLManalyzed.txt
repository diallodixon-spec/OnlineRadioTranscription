20251223 192117 I am a champion, my brother I'm a champion, my friend Mama, try your tears and move your hand from your head Never wear a front because that's another day Trust in every word we say, lassie say Lean in and mark us, fellassie fake us Sometimes the skies come tumbling down on you But of this one thing I'm sure George and Eve are given more than what I can pay Sometimes the road gets dark and it feels like no one cares Friends and family, they are gone But I will overcome cause I am a champion I am a champion friend so I run hungry and edge high teeth I stand up on my own two feet I make no trouble come and get rid of me I fight it
