20260101 125424 It's been as still as a tomb I needed you all so badly tonight But I guess you had better things to do I should have known that it was coming in this But I must have been blind I bet you still got a trace of her love in your eyes And you still got her eyes on your mind You swore you'd be with me at seven o'clock Now it's a quarter to three And whatever you got and whoever it was I guess you couldn't get it from me Whatever you've got and whoever it was I guess you could get it from me I know that you love me There's no need to talk
