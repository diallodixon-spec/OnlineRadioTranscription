For all the rough things that you go out and do Never know that John is watching you Just live up right and sit down And you will be okay, okay See each other first And if you're lost, you will guide us We'll guide your way Right this way Looking at the shooting star Up in the sky so far And the moon that shines in the night could make me you. It seems like it's daylight. Only a supernatural and true ordinary person could do what you do. So I know we've got to be you.
