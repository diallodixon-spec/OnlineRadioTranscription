============================================================

I'm gonna live life like the movies And if you start off I'm going to put you in the sea I mean, jewelry more than diamonds and rubies No matter where the moon is No angel I'm crying Stand below the black man Keep on wearing your smile Hey, that's just the way you are. You ain't changing your style. I appreciate you. There's a crowning in the sky. That's just the way you are.
