I'm just saying though that when you say a lot of it's not all churches but those that have damage that's all I'm saying to narrow it down. You see I'm not saying you got to tell it to your opinion. I mean I agree with it but I'm not saying it's a wrong one. I'm not saying that at all. I'm just saying to you that in terms of the question of need, not just to give me a fact that you are a church.

I'm saying that if your church is damaged, you can pull up a chapel and have a covering and still worship the Lord.
