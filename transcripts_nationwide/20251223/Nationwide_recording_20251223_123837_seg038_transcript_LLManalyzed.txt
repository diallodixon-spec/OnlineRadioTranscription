20251223 123837 running around in Mandeville like a chick without a head right and one day a teacher saw me and asked me what are you doing and I said to him nothing and he said there's no young man in his 20s can go around and say he's doing nothing you must be doing something yes and that is when I pick up a paintbrush and I learned to paint. Before I left Jamaica, I owned a little painting business, painting houses. And I came to America 21 years ago, enrolled in the International Union for Painters and Allied Trades. Went to school for painting, trade school for painting for three years. Well, I was supposed to do three years. They saw my skill. I only did one. Wow. And I took care of my family, took care of my son, take care of my family back home in Jamaica and took care of myself very well. Yes. Matter of fact, I am confident to say I live above average life in America. Very well.
