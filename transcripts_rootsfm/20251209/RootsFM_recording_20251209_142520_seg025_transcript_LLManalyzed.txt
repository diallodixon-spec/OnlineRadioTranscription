============================================================

All the gold in all the world is nothing to possess. All the things that it can bring, an attitude and ounce of your happiness. For your love, I would do anything just to see the smile on your face. For your love I would go anywhere. Just you tell me and I'll be right there. A diamond that shines like the star in the sky. It's nothing to me. Wait a minute. To you.
