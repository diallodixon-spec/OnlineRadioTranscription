20251231 190608 We are loan rangers and we recognize that we need help. So very important that we get the help under the support. Very good. So even if you're planning a family dinner, you don't have to do all five courses. You could get help. Somebody could do the rice and peas and other person do the meat to get help. I think we're moving to that now. I went to a couple dinners now and everybody was asked to do something and it was so, so fun. It was so interesting and delicious. Everybody's skills were experienced. So definitely, I agree with that. And the work wasn't left to one person. So definitely. So definitely a good way to manage the stress. And as I said, sleep, get that sleep in, try and get that sleep in. I don't know what you're talking about, you don't have to.
