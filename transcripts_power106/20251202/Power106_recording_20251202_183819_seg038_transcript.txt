of the DWH Foundation. Very good evening to you, sir, and welcome to Power Play. Good evening to you and your listeners. Yes, and certainly, every single day of this life, I think about the times we used to have, David Wallahund and myself going off to the mayor of the classic, taking the boys over there, coaching the Meadowbrook team. so it's really very special that I see and remember one of the brightest you'll ever see in terms of his ability to coach and he's superb all around not just a football people would remember that but track and field as well and not a day in our lives as far as we don't remember the great Wagahunt. That is very true. That is true. And I know you're aligned with what David has done in the past, Cliff. So, yes, we want to follow suit, you know. Yes, man, absolutely. All right, now we're talking about something new here, a new mentorship program.
