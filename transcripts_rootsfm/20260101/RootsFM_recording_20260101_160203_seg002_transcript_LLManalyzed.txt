20260101 160203 Some of this feeling just grows and grows, alright The more I see you is the more I want you, girl You wanna go back to what I knew before, oh no Got to take my time, cause you're genuine And I'm not blind, yes me know you're fine The only one for me can only be you. All right. My heart won't free you, my heart won't try. So the more I see you is the more I want you, girl.
