20260102 170908 I can't wait for that day when there'll be peace In the valley, in the valley, for me Someday there will be peace in the valley for me There'll be no sadness, no sorrow, no trouble for me There'll be peace in the valley someday I can't wait for that day when there'll be peace Troubles will be no more On that peaceful shore Oh, sorrow will go away Someday there'll be no sadness, no sorrow
