Jamaica people have something in their head. Courtney Walsh broke a record, set a record at Sabina Park on my birthday. I was hosting Smile Jamaica at the time. And I came on television and I said, thank you Courtney for that birthday gift. Couldn't have been a better one. Bl and Courtney there, you know? me say young Courtney Walsh I get married I said Courtney Walsh and I are not getting married. Wow. No the person who tell me son I get married and I true you don't want invite me make you never tell me. One time I just stop arguing people. I call Courtney one day and I say you don't want someone to give. I say you not want someone here.
