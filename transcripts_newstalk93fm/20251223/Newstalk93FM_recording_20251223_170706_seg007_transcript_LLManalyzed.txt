20251223 170706 You can find me out on the road, I'm ready to walk. Just the one time tonight Don't sign the party, can't no send no third party to find me I'm not going home tonight, not going home tonight Drunk in the party, so I don't think no third party can find me I was blind by the melodies, now the Now the liquor take all of me. And the bass knock my soul out. I'm a chess hooker, won't let me leave. I don't know if I'll survive. Song after song, wine after wine. I go sing strong and fit for life. Weak like the masses, kryptonite. You won't find me wherever I'm for sure.
