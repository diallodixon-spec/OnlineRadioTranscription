20251218 191617 I am operating from my recollection. I no longer have my documents from that time. I lost my documents in a computer wipe some time ago, sir. But here is what I rely on as support for my memory. When you look at the sexual offenses act, and you look at the provision under that same section 10, which criminalizes a person, a person who has sexual intercourse with another person who is under the age of 16. So if that person is 15 and has sex with a person under the age of 15, then they have a criminal liability. As well, if they're over 16 and have sex with the person under 16, they have criminal liability.
