mix martial art to have them gravitate or understand different methods from the methods that we're using to apply to their personal life. And we also try to involve a lot more hands-on training so some life skill learning goes on throughout the program. We also have mentors come in and speak about their experiences to help them understand that they are not worse off and being where they are right now. And every lesson is every opportunity is a lesson to learn from so that they can get to where they need to get to. So the program helps to develop most of these kids and some of them see the environment as a safe haven. And we want to continue to do this because we realize that it, other than contributing to the combat sport world, it also contributes to our society of having more rounded people being developed.
