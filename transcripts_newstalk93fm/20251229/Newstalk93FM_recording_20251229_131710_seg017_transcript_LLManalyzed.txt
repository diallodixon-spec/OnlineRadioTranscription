This world concrete, flowers grow. Hard days, she only doing what she know. Weakens, skitter popping on the low. Better days coming for sure. This world, world. If it was love to me, I wouldn't give if nobody's no sympathy I'd take away the pain, I'd give you everything I just wanna see, you ain't wanna see If this world were mad, you'd go in, out, door, slow Maybe you would stop, strike, close And I'm with you everything goes i'm coming for that on my soul
