She said she's not going to know all about eating in the day, in the evening, yeah, but she was going on meditation and I thought that was so cool. You know, she didn't get caught up in the old, yeah, ray, ray, lay, lay, you know? So I always like to hear when you are in your garden, you know, and being in the garden is so healing. It is so healing, you know? Absolutely. It's actually part of my daily routine. Oh.
