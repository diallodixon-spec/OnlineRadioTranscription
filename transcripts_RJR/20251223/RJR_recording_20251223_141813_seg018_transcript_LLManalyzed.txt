20251223 141813 Mama says son be wise and don't bring disgrace So me take off the broom and start sweep the place Cause all these ways they got to get erased I love to me people that me embrace The truth are the truth and I can't erase So hell to all of those who want hate Just send me to finish this race So we ain't giving up now We put up a fight we got to be ready We pray, we pray, we pray. Bless not the flow when the prayer gone up. Not the evil can harm us. Them think we don't care.
