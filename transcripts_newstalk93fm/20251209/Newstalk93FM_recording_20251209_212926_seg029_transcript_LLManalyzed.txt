The angels up in the clouds are jealous knowing we've found Hopeless hallelujah Hopeless side of heaven's gate Oh my life, I'll the clay. Oh, my, my, you're taking me out of the ordinary. I want you laying me down till we're dead and buried. On edge of your night Staying drunk on your vibe The angels up in the clouds Are jealous now that we've found So this world is ordinary You got me kissing the ground, sanctuary
