God demonstrates his love and faithfulness toward us. Almighty and Sovereign Lord, we adore and praise your matchless name. We lift our hearts and lives in praise to you, because you are our God, the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end, the first and the last. O God, the complexity of your Word reflects your power and wisdom, your creativity and sense of order. O God, we see you as the giver of life and the sustainer of all thy form. All that we are able to do as human beings, all our accomplishments we owe to you. We praise you, gracious God. We exalt you. We give you thanks for all that is at our disposal. Help us in all that we do to live our lives in gratitude to you.
