I think this is a step up. Of course, as I've said to people, it is very difficult when you are accustomed to certain facilities, certain utilities, and to lose them, and to be told that you won't be getting it back until four months, five months' time. But the character and scale of the damage is just inconceivable. So I think they are doing a good job and we have to recognize that I think it is not exactly what everybody would be satisfied with, but the damage is just unimaginable, as I said before. All right, we're going to leave it there, Mr. Wilson. Hope we can catch you next week, because we haven't even touched telecoms and the others yet. But we really appreciate your time and the update this afternoon. Thank you.
