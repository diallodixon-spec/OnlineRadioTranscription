20251224 115448 um i i think in terms of it in terms of the economy it could have been better um i i see where folks are getting new jobs um the economy is is not as great as it used to be but i think people people are coping. People are still living. People are still making do with what they have. And for the most part, look, we still get to do the things that we enjoy. And my friends, we get to travel, we get to go places, we get to do the things that we enjoy doing. So from that perspective, I think for the folks that I am associated with, I think we did relatively okay. Very well. Who do you want to shout out to in Jamaica before we go?
