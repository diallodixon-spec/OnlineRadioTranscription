20251216 133926 I'm glad you're doing so well. If only you could see how I've been. If I'm being real, no, it ain't been the same. We could talk if we want. I already know it's no good for me. It's all right. I think I'm fine with the silence. There's some good and goodbyes Oh, I'm back on your sofa Of course I still care And love's never wasted when it's shared And although it's over I'll always be there Only have a couple minutes And we're going back to real life
