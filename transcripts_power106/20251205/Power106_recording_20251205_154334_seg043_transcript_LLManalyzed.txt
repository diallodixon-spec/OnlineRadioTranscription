In my opinion, we have an estate in our state. So if that is so, we must find some international arbitrator or a coach or something. And we just go about solving this problem once and for all yes yeah man you can do because right now based on based on the laws of jamaica probably it is in the the the right of the prime minister to extend the treaty but why the prime minister would want to do that considering that there is there is you know a dispute between the mar, the way the maroons think about their community and think about the rest of the country.
