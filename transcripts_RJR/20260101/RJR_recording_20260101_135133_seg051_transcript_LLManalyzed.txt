20260101 135133 some tech issues. We're trying to sort out. So if you don't hear me and Johnny saying happy birthday to no one, one don't feel the way we want to say happy birthday to everyone who is celebrating a birthday today on this year, January one. Absolutely. Yeah. Yeah. I'm seeing a few things here. It says blessings to my family. Wish ZJ Jeremy happy birthday coming from fans in Queens, New York to my family. I would like to send new year greetings and belated anniversary greetings to mr. And mrs. Victor Gordon and Enid Gordon from one price lane celebrated 25 years of marriage
