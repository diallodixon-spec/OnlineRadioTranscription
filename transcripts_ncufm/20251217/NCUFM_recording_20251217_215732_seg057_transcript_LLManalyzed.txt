20251217 215732 Let their voices loud and strong Let those verses by His blood Live to hear the song of love Nothing more He'd rather hear Not so bleeping to His ear Has His favorite song of all He loves to hear the angels as they sing the Holy, Holy is the Lamb Heaven's choirs in harmony lift up praises to the great I am. Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Hallelujah! He lifts his hands for silence when the weakest saved by grace begins to sing. And the million angels listen.
