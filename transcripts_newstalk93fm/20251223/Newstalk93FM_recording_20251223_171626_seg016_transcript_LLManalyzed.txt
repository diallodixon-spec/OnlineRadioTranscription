20251223 171626 Let me be your woman. Woman, woman in your life and take away the drama. Put the paper in the picture like a diorama. Gotta face a lot of people that are opposite. Cause the world told me we ain't got the common sense. Gotta prove it to myself that I'm on top of shit. And you would never know a guy without a goddess is honest. And speaking honest kid, and I could be on everything. I mean, I could be the leader, head of all the states. I could smile and jiggle and tell this pocket's empty. I could be the CEO, just like a Robin Fante. And I'ma be there for you, cause you on my team, girl. Don't ever think you ain't had these dreams, girl They wanna pit us against each other when we succeed And for no reason, they wanna see us end up like we Regina or Mean Girl Princess or queen, tomboy or king You've heard a lot, you've never seen Mother Earth, Mother Mary, rise to the top
