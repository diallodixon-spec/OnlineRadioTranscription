20251229 200704 I love you, God. You make me strong. God is a bedrock under my feet. The castle in which I live. My rescuing night. My God, the high crag. Where I run for dear life. Hiding behind the boulders. Safe in the granite hideout. I sing to God the praise lofty and find myself safe and saved. The hangman's noose was tied at my throat. Devil waters rushed over me.
