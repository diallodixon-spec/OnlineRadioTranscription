Um this person is asking about that uh visa integrity fee that we haven't really heard much more about but I'll I'll ask the question just the same. Um it's asking if students are going on the J one program, if they will be required to pay that integrity fee. If it when let's not let's not talk about integrity until next year because yeah, we we really know when yeah, if you're supposed to pay a fee, you're going to be notified guys. Just yeah, we we don't know. We haven't heard much more. The visa fee remains the same as it is now. Um we cross our fingers and hope that it remains that way. Um but yeah, there no fee right now. Just the regular fee that you're used to and we we press along until uh here is oh well, we have a caller on the line. Who do we have?
