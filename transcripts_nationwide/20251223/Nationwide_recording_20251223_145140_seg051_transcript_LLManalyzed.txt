20251223 145140 Together we flow If ever apart All I want you to know Is your love is life changing And I couldn't even tell me that you died Your love is life saving You always get me when I fall There's people just like you and me who pass them in the traffic That people fall in love and some of them have except lucky Enough of them are fortunate enough to have somebody Some just can't see beyond the flesh and it's so funny Never get too caught up in yourself to feel the magic Love come and pass you by and life at it's a tragic Opportunity is grace at the end of the day
