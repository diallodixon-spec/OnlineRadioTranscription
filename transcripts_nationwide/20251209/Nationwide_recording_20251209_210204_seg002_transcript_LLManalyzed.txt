to put in the work and that can be a variety of many different men with different traits but i feel like he must have told himself and made up his mind that he wants to be in a relationship and he's going to honor it and do his best that's the type of man that should be in a relationship does it matter in that, you're hoping that that ideal man who has made these choices has the ideal woman or is it a good idea for a man to have that idea generally and seek to apply it to relationships? Ask again, go again. Should a man decide that he wants to find the specific person to be that person to or is it a general idea he should have and say Any woman may find that's how I will approach it
