20251230 125137 When I found you, you were young We were lost in the cold Pulled up to you in the jag Turned your rags into gold The winding road leads to the chateau You remind me of a younger me I saw potential I'll be your father figure I drink that brown liquor I can make deals with the devil Because my dick's bigger This love is pure profit Just step into my office I dry your tears with Wesley Leave it with me I protect the family Leave it with me, leave it with me, I protect the family Leave it with me I protect the family I pay the check before it kisses the mahogany grain Said they wanna see you
