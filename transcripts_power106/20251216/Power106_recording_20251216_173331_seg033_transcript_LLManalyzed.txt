I made note recently that my favorite, right, in response to your question, the song The Harder They Come, The Harder They Fall, the one and all, because that one speaks to my own journey, a journey of empowerment, and one about having confidence, and one where you tell yourself, and not only me, but many Jamaicans, that I'm a child of the universe, I have a right to be here, get up, go there, get it, and to know that those who may be your detractors, or whatever challenge there may be in your life, you tell yourself the harder they come, the harder they fall. Because as sure as that sun shines, you have something to get. You must get your share of what's mine. That's the type of, that's the character, that's the life, that's the man who we will later rest tomorrow.
