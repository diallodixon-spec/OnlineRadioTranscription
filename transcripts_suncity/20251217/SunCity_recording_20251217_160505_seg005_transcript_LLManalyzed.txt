20251217 160505 Stay on Sun City 104.9 FM. It's Sun Jock. Alipatch. I'm full for the blessings that are falling on my table. Learning all my lessons, now I'm willing and I'm able to do just what I can. As humble as a lamb, working towards the goal and we give thanks for helping hands. Pray for health and strength and life and length and peace of mind. Good people and good vibes, we give thanks every time. In every single line, even if it's not rhyme, I'll go sing redemption songs to the people when I think of where I'm coming from. Looking back, I dread the journey.
