Yeah, we're going to attach a device to you that's going to measure your heart rate, but it also measures how much you sweat. Oh, this is going to be a very fun experiment, that is. You're going to try to annoy me and see how sweaty I get. So, James, I'm just going to hand you over to Adam Thomas from Arup, who's going to get you set up for the experiment. Hello, Adam.
