20251231 181106 Angela big up yourself for blazing the fire for this one so let me play this back once again for Angela here we go I'ma leave my head above water and try to save myself from drought. There's an overnight scheme all worked out, designed to keep me down. Still I'm putting up a resistance. I'ma gonna work it out. You know I'm putting up resistance. I've gotta work it out. Window, oh, window. I wanna stay home tonight. I long to spend some time with the family. But staying home won't make it right. Sometimes the pressure make me feel like taller. When every sign says no way out. Breaking my back to make an overture.
