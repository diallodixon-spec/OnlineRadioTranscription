Every time I'm out in the yard, he comes to see me. Who is monitoring my headset? Give me a little bit more volume on that. Thank you so much. We're out in the yard at 32 Lindus Road. It's just to treat the people. Give them a slice of ham. You want a slice of ham, don did you hear that? I had a bad ulcer. What did you see?
