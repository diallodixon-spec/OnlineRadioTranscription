As we celebrate International Day for Persons with Disabilities, I call on Jamaicans as we seek to rebuild the West to allow the West to be a model for the East for accessibility and inclusion. We have this great opportunity through Melissa to build back better to ensure the inclusion of everyone. Thank you so very much for giving me this opportunity. A pleasure and see you much sooner than later Dr. Hendricks, all the very best. Definitely, you too, thank you.
