2025-12-12 14:17:26 You're coming in, you're coming in closer Make the thing catch your fire Spread it all on the ground, all over the counter With that button, the fire is your Cocoa Tea alarm When I'm feeling under the weather You just make me feel sweet Ice the Cocoa Tea, use the sugar And together we are complete, darling. I'm not leaving until I wet Come to play amass I don't live my life with regrets, no I come to jam on a bumper Come to drink all the liquor Until my head's gone and I'm miserable All down on the ground I'm causing trouble Look how these security are watching me They don't know I'm on the ground
