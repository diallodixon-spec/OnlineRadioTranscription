I hopped off the plane at LAX With a dream, my cardigan Welcome to the land of fame and sex Am I gonna fit in? Jumped in the cab, here I am for the first time Look to my right and I see the Hollywood sign This is all so crazy Everybody seems so famous My tummy's turning and I'm feeling kinda homesick Too much pressure and I'm nervous That's when the taxi man turned on the radio Energy is stronger love, energy is stronger love. Energy is stronger love. Allow. Energy is stronger. Allow me to. Energy is stronger, love. Energy is. Stronger love. Allow me. Allow me to re-induce myself.
