We think we have reached our full potential with corruption. So she also wants laws to criminally prosecute people who disagree with politicians. And that is relative to her suggesting that the criminal libel laws should be reinstated. Which means if I say something that's libelous, not only would I be sued for damages, but I could also end up in a criminal court and in prison. And of course, just for those of you who love to say, why don't you investigate more? Why don't you be more like the American journalists. The American journalists don't have that issue, right? Their libel laws are much freer than ours and you have to prove malice in order to have lawsuits and the like. Here, you only have to call a man name wrong and he won't sue you.
