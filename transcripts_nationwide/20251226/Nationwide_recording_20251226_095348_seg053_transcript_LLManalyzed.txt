And I will not stop till I know your heart If I touch you, I don't mind Will you scream if you let down your guard My baby, it's not too far from here to ecstasy I know you won't do nothing, so play by me next to me. Baby, do you, do you, baby, do you? Oh, we're falling, falling down. And baby, I'll do you.
