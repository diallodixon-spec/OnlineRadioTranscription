**Exclusive Interview: Vincent Morrison, President of the Union of Clerical, Administrative and Supervised Employers, Shares Expectations for 2026**

In a candid conversation with Rodston Hyman on Power 106 FM, Vincent Morrison, President of the Union of Clerical, Administrative and Supervised Employers, outlined his expectations from the government in 2026. Morrison emphasized the need for the government to prioritize the welfare of its citizens, particularly in the areas of housing, healthcare, and education.

Morrison expressed his disappointment with the current state of the security guard industry, stating that it is "not very far from 200 years ago" in terms of its approach and psychological arrangement. He highlighted the plight of security guards who are struggling to make ends meet, with many unable to afford basic necessities like medicine. Morrison urged the government to take immediate action to address these issues and provide decent benefits and wages to the workers.

The union president also touched on the topic of inflation, stressing the need for supermarkets and other businesses to do better in containing prices. He criticized the government's handling of the health sector, citing the example of the Cornell Regional Hospital, and called for a more focused approach to addressing the country's healthcare challenges.

Morrison further emphasized the importance of integrated rural development, driven by agriculture, to control urban drift and promote rural employment. He suggested that the all-inclusive concept of tourism has been detrimental to the economy, as it fails to distribute wealth across the country. Instead, he proposed a more comprehensive approach to tourism, one that links agriculture and tourism to create a more sustainable and equitable industry.

In a surprising revelation, Morrison announced that his union has decided to build three houses for workers from scratch, two in Westmoreland and one in St. Elizabeth, as part of their contribution to the restoration of the country. He expressed his sympathy for sugar workers and security guard workers who have been affected by the recent hurricane and pledged to continue assisting these groups.

Throughout the interview, Morrison reiterated the need for the government to work with unions and other stakeholders to address the country's challenges. He warned against the dangers of anti-union posture and emphasized the importance of collective bargaining and cooperation. As the conversation concluded, Morrison urged the government to prioritize its citizens' needs and work towards creating a more equitable and sustainable society.

In a parting statement, Morrison said, "We can do better. We can do better. But we need to decide on our priorities and stick to it." His words serve as a call to action for the government and citizens alike, emphasizing the need for collective effort and cooperation to build a better future for Jamaica.
