============================================================

at this point in time. You know, the Light the World campaign is more than an event. It is an invitation to live Christmas with purpose. By remembering the Nativity of Jesus Christ, we invite everyone to be more like He was and to be more like he is. I'd like to close today by bearing my testimony of Jesus Christ. He is the light of the world and we can all be like him and we can all share light with others through simple access service. I know that as we do this that we will bring light and hope and life to many, many persons this Christmas.
