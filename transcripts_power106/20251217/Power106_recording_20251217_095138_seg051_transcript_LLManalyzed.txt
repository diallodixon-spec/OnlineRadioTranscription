20251217 095138 I don't make this comment loosely. What I'm speaking about are discussions that were held way back from before any malice or anything come on the table. This is a discussion that is anchoring it on the issue of the license, way before any Melissa came up, right? And we are of the view that we cannot wait two years into a new country for a license to be sorted out, for the workers to be treated a particular way to face the cost of living consequences, et cetera. And the Melissa thing came in October, right? But we are talking about pre-October. Yeah, I know, but I don't think that, I mean, they would be asking it to wait for two years. What they are saying is that although we had that agreement, Melissa is an unforeseen consequence.
