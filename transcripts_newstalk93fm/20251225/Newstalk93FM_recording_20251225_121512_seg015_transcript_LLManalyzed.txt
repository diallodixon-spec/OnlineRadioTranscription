20251225 121512 Said I'm falling, falling, I'm falling As I lay my bed with my head to the ceiling Say I'm drowning alone and I'm lost in my feelings Somebody send me a sign cause you know that I need it love Jump up and show me love, wait up and show love Together we all need love, jump up and show love Wait up and show love
