**Jamaica Darts Association Aims to Revitalize the Sport**

In an exclusive interview with Evan Faulkner, Communications Officer at the Jamaica Darts Association, it was revealed that the organization is working tirelessly to revitalize the sport of darts in Jamaica. Faulkner shared that the association has been leading the development of the sport in Jamaica for over 30 years and has been responsible for organizing players, clubs, and national teams in international tournaments.

The Jamaica Darts Association has had notable achievements, including winning the Caribbean Cup six times and producing several Caribbean champions. Faulkner highlighted the importance of the sport, stating that "darts is really about accuracy, precision with your throwing and your aim and your counting." He also emphasized the need for concentration, remaining calm under pressure, and practice to play the sport well.

Faulkner discussed the association's plans for expansion and increased awareness, including starting a school league and a business house league. He also mentioned that the association has partnerships with various sponsors, including the Sports Development Foundation and the Jamaica Olympic Association.

The interview also touched on the topic of darts in schools, with Faulkner revealing that the association has been working with several schools to introduce the sport and provide coaching and mentoring to young players. He expressed optimism about the future of the sport, citing the example of a young player named Crazy Harty, who is playing in a big online league and developing his game exponentially.

The next Caribbean Championships are scheduled to take place in the Bahamas in July, and Faulkner expressed the association's commitment to supporting players who want to participate in the tournament. He also encouraged anyone interested in the sport to reach out to the association through their social media platforms.

In a surprising turn of events, the interview was followed by a discussion about a tragic incident in the United States, where a Hollywood director and actor, Rob Reino, and his wife were found dead in their home. The host of the show expressed shock and outrage at the incident, as well as at the response of the President of the United States, who made a post online attacking the victims due to their political views. The host described the President's behavior as "despicable" and "lacking decency and sensitivity."
