20251219 092114 to Revelation, we read of people just like you and me who received God's promises. These promises are sealed by the highest authority. That's God's Word. Today we claim the promise from Lamentations 3, verses 22 and 23. It says, Because of the Lord's great love we are not consumed. For His compassions never's mercies are fresh every morning. Each sunrise brings a new portion of his love.
