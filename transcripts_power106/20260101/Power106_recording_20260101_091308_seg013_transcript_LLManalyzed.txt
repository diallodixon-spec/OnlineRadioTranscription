20260101 091308 As we go down life's lonesome highway Seems the hardest thing to do Is to find a friend too That helping hand Someone who understands When you feel you've lost your way You've got someone there to say I'll show you Say you, say me Say it for always That's the way it should be Say it to you, say it to me Say it together
