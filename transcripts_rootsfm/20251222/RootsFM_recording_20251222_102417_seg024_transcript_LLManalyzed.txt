20251222 102417 And I forget about all the troubles I seem to have. And I tell myself to feel how my brother feels. Try to love a man, maybe then I'll understand. Make a little room in our hearts. No hearts too small. Can't we love each other today cause after all this is Christmas let the world sing Let us all begin to hear. Hallelujah! This is Christmas. And with love we can begin to sing.
