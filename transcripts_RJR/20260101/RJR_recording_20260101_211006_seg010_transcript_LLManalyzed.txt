20260101 211006 No life in your strife and stress Don't you forget this, yes You're an eagle soaring above No rest, jump, drop, you can pick and try But them can't fly as high Just open your eyes Up, up, up, up And look to the skies Up, up, soaring high, high, higher, higher Spread your wings and fly And look to the skies Soaring high, higher Spread your wings, and fly So what they wanna say is say that So what they wanna do is do that Chill out, we'll bring you truth, it's true that. It's on my side, on my side.
