20251231 133823 We're going to the new year. Me too. Me too. But something that disturbed me this week though, and I must say it before we go into the new year. Tell me. Education needs budget. It does. And we just need to stop the political thing, people. This is a Jamaica thing. This is our children thing. Education need budget. When I read it, the principal is saying that at 10 years now, they have to be using the same budget to run the school. Mm hmm. That is a disgrace. 17, 000 per child but this but but this is what I want to know though and that's why you see every time I come on the show, I say to people, I'm it's okay to be ignorant to say it's okay. To be ignorant of something but but it's not okay to not want to get up ignorance out of your system. Right. So let me ask some questions. I know we all pay an education tax. Yes. So my thing is, what does the education tax total? What is being collected each year?
