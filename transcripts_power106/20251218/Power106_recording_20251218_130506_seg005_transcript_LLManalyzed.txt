20251218 130506 I think you're having the farmers market here. And based on the prices that I heard should have been quoting of how expensive, I said let me come and try and see what happens. Because even this scallion was like, scallion 400 a pound, not bad. And like the pop choy, that's good. With carrot, local is 350 and the imported one is £3.00. And we got onions. Surprisingly, when I buy onions, it's like £400 a pound. So today I could get onions for like £2.50 or £2.50. Local onions? It seems local. I didn't ask, but it seems local. Most of the stuff that they were selling were local stuff. The lettuce and the pop choy are local and cucumbers and so on. But like tomatoes, those were imported. I didn't get any of those. But the prices you were paying were acceptable. Good prices. Have I seen you at the Emancipation Park before? Yes.
