20251216 124530 We found something so wild from the ordinary. You got me kissing the ground from your sanctuary. Shatter me when you you. Breathe it, take my breath away. At your altar, I will pray. You're the sculptor, I'm the clay. Oh, my, my, you're taking me out of the ordinary. I want you laying me down so we can bury. On the edge of your night, staying drunk on your vibe. The angels up in the clouds are jealous, knowing we found something so right.
