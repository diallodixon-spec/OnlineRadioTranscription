20251230 093624 motor vehicles, we have to get it. And I'm insisting. I mean, look at these men who are earning from the bike through the courier service. Neither of them, most of them do not have a driver's license to drive the bike. You know, one of the problems, I'll tell you one of the problems. You know, I call it as I see it. It's the least expensive way to get mobile. Good? Yes. So access is really not the problem. But guess what happens now? Because you don't have that oversight and enforcement, it's like a toy. And so you'll find that those go about and those do what they're doing and what have you. They're not being held to account. That's the problem, you know. So once you can, you get to put them all together, together you get a bike and you're on your own that's what it is once you can balance right that's what that's what's happening for 2026 i think that is where we should go and see if we can cut down for 2026 the accidents on the road mark
