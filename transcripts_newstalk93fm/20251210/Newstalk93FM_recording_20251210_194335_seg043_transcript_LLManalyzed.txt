Tell them, tell them, tell them my gun I say tell them my gun Don't even bandah callin' me Tell em, tell em, hey, hey Go tell me about work in the mornin' Unless we talkin' hard work Fine and jam, bring up a nagyal I say in castle, they don't work in the morning Unless we're talking hard work Wine and go and sit down behind a desk Talk about it, hey, hey I'm taking a mental day I need a little run away, cause I need good sleep
