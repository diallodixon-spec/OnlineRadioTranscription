20251224 143731 of another woman in middle quarter, St. Elizabeth, a 41-year-old man, Andre Daniels, has been taken into custody by the St. Elizabeth Police Division. Daniels' arrest last week comes amid what police describe as one of the strongest crime-fighting years in recent times for the St. Elizabeth Division, Superintendent Coolridge Minto, saying I want to commend the members of the St. Elizabeth Criminal Investigation Branch for their diligent work on this investigation that has now led to charges being laid. I want to commend the Manchester Division for their coordinated operational efforts in apprehending this individual. Wow, lots of big words by the way Superintendent.
