20251212 145438 The memory of your smiling face. So I had to call you up and say, gee whiz, it's Christmas. So don't forget the party that we're throwing. The warm fire from the fireplace will be glowing. It's been a long, long time. I still can't figure out why you crossed my mind. I guess it's just to say, gee whiz, it's Christmas. I'm wishing you a merry, have a merry, merry Christmas. Gee whiz.
