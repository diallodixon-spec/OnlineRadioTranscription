20251231 175847 must confess that I love appearing before the jury at first instance and that is where I really made my name as an advocate. King's Council you mentioned earlier your detractors and I was struck by a letter I saw published in the Jamaica Gleaner penned by retired president of the Court of Appeal, Seymour Panton. And I thought it was, this is my characterization entirely now, I thought it was uncharitable, indeed unkind. The retired justice speaks to that the incoming DPP has good examples to follow. And he went out of his way, I thought, to list James Carr, Ian Ford, Glenn Andrade and Kent Pantry. Now the letter obviously by its omission is suggesting that the most recent incumbent would not be a good example to follow.
