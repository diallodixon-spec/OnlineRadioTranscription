20260101 214923 I'm just saying, if it look like a duck, act like a duck, and quack like a duck, let's be real, man. It's a duck. Quack, quack. What if that duck had a fit in me? Fit in my duck if I keep it. Y'all are crazy. I have a friend. He wouldn't act like that, so you had to let him go. I already know. If he don't love you by now, he never will.
