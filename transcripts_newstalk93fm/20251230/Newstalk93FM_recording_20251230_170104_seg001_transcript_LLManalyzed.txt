20251230 170104 A spiritual encounter In me soul taking over Telling me to start up me drinking And do away with good behaviour So we out on the road now It's Mars and Riddim and Soka And are ready for the rum Ready ready for the rum, ready Me punching that's automatic I have a lightning jumbie, a kind of energy inside me And it ready for the rum, ready ready for the rum Ready ready for the rum ready for the action A spiritual encounter, in me soul faking over Telling me to start up me drinking, and do away with good behaviour
