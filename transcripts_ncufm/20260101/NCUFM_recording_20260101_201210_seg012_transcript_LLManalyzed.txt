20260101 201210 I will rule in the power of the cross The things I thought were gain, I count as loss And with his suffering I identify And by his resurrection power I am alive For I am crucified with Christ and yet I live Not I but Christ that lives within me His cross will never ask for more than I can give For it's not my strength but his There's no greater sacrifice
