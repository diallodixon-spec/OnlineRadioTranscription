20260101 152618 For the night it's over Get up, get up, get busy, do it Get up and move that body Get up, people, now get down, do turn me You give love instinctively Round and round, you turn me Upside down Boy, you turn me Inside out And round and round Upside down Boy you turn me inside out and round and round Instinctively you give to me the love that I need I cherish the moments with you
