20251229 194028 As the year closes out, the Bank of Jamaica recently held its quarterly monetary policy report press conference to update the nation on key financial matters. For today's Going For Growth, we highlight the major points coming out of the Central Bank's report. We start with Jamaica's economy. The BOJ says conditions are in place to support a gradual economic recovery in coming years, despite the challenges brought by Hurricane Melissa. Governor Richard Biles says although economic activity contracted sharply in the immediate aftermath of the storm, reconstruction efforts and inflows of external financing are expected to help drive renewed growth. Recovery activity will be supported by funding from multilateral institutions, private sector investment, and disaster risk financing mechanisms. These inflows are expected to boost spending, create jobs, and restore productive capacity across key sectors.
