20251226 182121 I'm on the prison bus This is it, the apocalypse I'm waking up, I can't admit my fault Don't make my mistakes go slow Welcome to the new age, to the new age died Deep in my bones, straight from inside I'm weighing it all, I can't even see my bones Don't make my dreams come true Welcome to the new age, to the new age welcome to the new age
