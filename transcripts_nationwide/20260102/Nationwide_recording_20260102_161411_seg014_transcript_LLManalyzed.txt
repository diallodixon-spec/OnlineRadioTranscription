BlackPoet35 on my TikTok says kindness to self. Kindness to self man. That is very important. Somebody else says anti-procrastination. Progression. Jerome says progression. Somebody here on my TikTok lives says consistency. Tomoe on Instagram says two words faith and persistence. Angola here on my TikTok says stay strong and courageous. Miss D Gemini says forget them. Jessica Befee says flowing. Jamed says awake.
