20251226 130808 They're not alive and I don't like them. They're my enemies and they're not friends. They're not alive, and I do not like them. Yes! Pull up! Pull up! I'm so clinging to the pure love, till outside it hurts every time. Judgement, I can't, I can't make a difference. I ain't got no fear, I ain't the only one who knows I'm a ghost. I'm the free on the pack of chairs, I'm just like a woman, I'm not a ghost. I ain't, I ain't no one who knows, I ain't a ghost, I'm a man, I'm a ghost!
