20251222 104722 I wish that someday we could find the way I think we're all reminded we're still kids at heart In the eyes of a child we're all the same If every day could be a day like Christmas, his smile would be on everybody's face. There would be no worries, just lots of joy. He enjoys to share with every girl and boy. Christmas time is here, and the loves is in the air. Every man who's a poor boy and girl.
