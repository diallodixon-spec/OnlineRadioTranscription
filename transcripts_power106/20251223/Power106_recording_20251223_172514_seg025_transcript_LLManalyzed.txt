20251223 172514 We are looking forward to, for Eastern Jamaica, part of Central Jamaica, for the operators to enjoy the holiday season in terms of making a few dollars. We are impacted not just by Hurricane Melissa, but by the authorities not giving us a good keep in terms of, you know, that 16% and where we need to get something done. Parking facilities right across Jamaica are gravely inadequate and in a deplorable condition in some area. You don't get those things. So this year wasn't a good year for the public transport sector, not at all. But of course, if you operate in the right way, this Christmas holiday, I think you will be able to make a dollar. One thing I must point out though is that, and I speak very softly on this because I want to get into it very rough next year, is where you have Indra and Uber. They are the main takers.
