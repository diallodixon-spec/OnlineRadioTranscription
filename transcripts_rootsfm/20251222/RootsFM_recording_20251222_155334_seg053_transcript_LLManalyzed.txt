20251222 155334 Feel so good, and there is no doubt I will stay with you As each morning brings a sunrise And the flowers bloom in springtime On my love and you can rely I will stay with you Oh I will stay With you Through your ups and your downs I will stay with You When no one else is around. When the dark comes around, I will stay by your side. And I know we'll be all right. I'll stay with you.
