20251218 172824 talking to us from the perspective of having seen what it was like. Definitely. When you were coming from feet of mud and debris everywhere and zinc and pieces of building and roof everywhere. Definitely, even the stench that was present after the devastation, the flies that were present here, it was a total mess. So as I said, commendation to the authorities who made this possible. At least persons can now traverse the town. And if you notice, even the surgical bank that was damaged, now they have a facility made from containers so at least persons don't have to travel to Mandeville. They can now visit the branch here in Black River. That's what was happening. You had to go to Mandeville to do it back.
