20251215 104232 Hopefully an attorney will assist this family pro bono because they don't have the financial resources and I hope an attorney is listening and they always, you know, happy to assist families in this way and so on. So maybe, you know, this could be one for him. I will personally reach out to him and see if he is willing to take up this matter. Thank you so much on behalf of the family. God bless you and take care. Continue to do the good work. You know you could have please turn a blind eye and don't pay this any attention but you decide to put pen to paper right and here it is getting the legs that it deserves. Thanks a lot MP Durin Campbell over there in Western Portland.
