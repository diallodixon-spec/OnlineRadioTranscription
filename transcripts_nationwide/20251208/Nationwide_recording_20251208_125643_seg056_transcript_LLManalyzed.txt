God addressed Moses saying I am God tell Pharaoh king of Egypt everything I say to you and Moses answered look at me I stutter why would Pharaoh listen to me God told Moses look at me I'll make you as a god to Pharaoh and your brother Aaron will be your prophet. You're to speak everything I command you and your brother, Aaron will tell it to Pharaoh. Then he will release the Israelites from his land. At the same time, I am going to put Pharaoh's back up and follow it up by filling Egypt with signs and wonders. Pharaoh is not going to listen to you, but I will have my way again.
