20251218 162317 So many people won't lick my skews So baby chew me cause I'll be your tooth And if I undo your two by two You fit to scream, you could lose in your pool So many reasons are written in the stars Oh my god, you're the reason I do what I do So baby make you give me your love make you give me that love. If you give me me, I'm not gonna let go. Make you give me, make I get my zanko. Feelings got me hitting on the freaky dance floor. Diallo, diallo, if I give you my love, make you know this happening.
