20251217 121813 If I give you my time Can you search my soul from it? I don't wanna wait Don't take it Take me where I ain't been before Can you lose my breath, make me water Hopefully, you can last all night. Don't get too excited. Oh, privacy. You ain't got to go nowhere. You can stay inside it. Can you blow my mind?
