Rabbi Yaakov Raskin, thank you for speaking with us about the great concert that's going to be happening this weekend at King's House. It's from Hurricane Melissa Recovery, and we are always in support of that. So if you can go out and get those tickets, please do. And always happy to have with us our credit union vibes family on a Wednesday. Our fact of the day, the World Health Organization has documented that men across regions are less likely than women to seek health care services, particularly preventative care, which contributes to later diagnosis and poorer health outcomes. Men, we do not want to outlive you. We want to have you with us as long as we can. So 2026, let's make it a great year for men's health, right, Johnny? Always great to share this show with you, my brother.
