Somehow we eat our food sometimes, we're not even thanking God for the food that we eat because you know how much people have no food to eat. You know how much people in some places and we wish them could have even eat some rice, just rice alone, much less rice and butter. So today is a day where we want to ensure that you understand that. You know, we must give God thanks and we must look at God's love and we must stay in his presence always praying pray don't stop pray don't don't don't stop look at at your life and realize that you are no way without God if you can actually see a life and say you can't make it without God then you know say everything is gonna be alright because I'm gonna help you to understand your real purpose on this life so today it's he that do it in the secret place of the most I abide in the shadows of the Lord just pray brought to you by the National Council on Drug Abuse
