And you must sleep with me So we could have a good time and party Spreading good vibes in Harlem Giving the C to the H, the R to the R to the S, the D to the M, A, S Giving us time of year Children's nightly It is profiling The spirit of love is in the air The best gifts you can give Don't cost you Give love to one another. Let season. From this family to your family. Merry Christmas time. I told you I was out. So come one and all, and let's have a ball. Be safe, and remember, drink Christmas.
