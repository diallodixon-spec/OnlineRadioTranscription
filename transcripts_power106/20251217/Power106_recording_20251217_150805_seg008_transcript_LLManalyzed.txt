20251217 150805 Sometimes wells are fed by ground water. Sometimes they are given water by whoever makes them yeah you do have wells actually occurring in nature but I mean most for the most part it is man-made right so but the key difference between that is a river and a well well water is stored below ground. River water flows underneath. I know porous have a lot of wells. But I'm observing a lot a bit. Over here in Spring Grove I think.
