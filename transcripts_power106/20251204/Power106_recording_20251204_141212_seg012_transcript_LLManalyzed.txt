============================================================

about the fact that there are many people out there who are pooling their resources and putting things together, then you'll recognize that what you give does make a difference. It will impact the overall picture. So we want to encourage you to do what you can to help others around you during these very difficult times. As usual, the phone lines are open and the only thing that we say to you is be nice to each other. Make sure you're cordial, make sure you are respectful of the other person. They might have a different opinion from yours, but we really want to encourage you to just rally around the cause of helping us to work together like one big happy family to develop a better country. And the way we can do that is to be more cooperative.
