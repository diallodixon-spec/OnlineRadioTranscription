20251226 141917 Yeah. and I don't want to stop when they call me Lucy. But I'm looser than Lucy. I'm sweeter than she said. This can never harm me. So damn loose, hey. Get loose away, get loose, get loose away. Get loose, get loose, away. Loosen your ways, kill them with your pain. Now show me your slackness. Show me your winter practice. Lucy is a kind of body. And that's the way I be. So I look, I don't have to fight. Workin', workin' at the bottom. And I'm chuggin', chuggin' all the bottom. And they call me Lucy. I'm a bad boy. Bad boy. A bad boy.
