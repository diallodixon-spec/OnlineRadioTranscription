But I can't let you go. Hey, you got me on my tippy toes. Say no more. I don't want to be a supergirl. Sometimes we only see what's up there. We only want to know what we did. Because some things bring a light, help us through the night. But when we build protocols, we build them too high. I need to go home somehow. I need to run away right now, right now. Everything I know is wrong. Everything I had is gone. I just want to go home to that place where I'm safe. I want to go home. Victim of a foolish heart, she set her hopes to hide. She let her guard walk out believing he was fine. Everything will go until he goes. He's not different, no. Just another average Joe.
