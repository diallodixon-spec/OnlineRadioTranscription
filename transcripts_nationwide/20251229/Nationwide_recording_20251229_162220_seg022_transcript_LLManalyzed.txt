20251229 162220 And ever since you've been gone I've been holding us down on my own And no one ever lied to me Sometimes been asking me why Why I never left you And why I kept it real And why I'm still with you You should've known better than to think I would leave You should've know better than to doubt me It don't matter if you're up, matter if you're down Either way, I'm gonna be around You shoulda known, baby, I see you workin' hard Wanna let you know I'm proud, let you know that I admire what you do Don't know if I need to reassure you if my life would be purposeless without you If I want it, when I ask you, you inspire me to be better Challenge me for the better Sit back and let me pour all my love better Let me help you Take off your shoes Untie your shoestrings Take off your cufflinks Do you wanna eat blue? Let me feed you
