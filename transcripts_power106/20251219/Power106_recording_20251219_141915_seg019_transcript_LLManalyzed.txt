20251219 141915 Welcome back to our Christmas Farmers Market coverage. It is Power 106 FM's Farmers Market as we celebrate farmers for Christmas. They have been through a lot and we thought that as a way of giving back to them, we would give them the space to come and sell their market produce and that is what what they're doing, their farm produce, and that's what they're doing. And they've been selling up a storm. And guess who stopped by? Ms. Maisy, good afternoon, so good to see you. Hi, good afternoon, good afternoon. And I must comment, what a beautiful market.
