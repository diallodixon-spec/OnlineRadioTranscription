20251215 125543 Baby girl, I want you to pray this One day without your loving and the rasta get seasick Not even Viva when me sick can heal this Loving when you give me complete this and need it Deep as the blue sea, your love's flowing into me And even though the waves are rough, this love is tough, just love me Deep as the blue seas, deep as the blue seas Love me really, actually And even though the storms will come, no, we won't run, just love me. Deep as the blue sea, nice and easy, so deeply we submerge under this emotion. Like an anchor, you keep me safe, I'm not afraid of the ocean keep you warm and cozy you'll be coming on my arms when the storms approaches so why funny when all of us think like the titanic the lighthouse we are where i fall in as the blue sea your love's flowing into me and even though the waves are rough this love is time
