============================================================

Leave it with me I protect the family I pay the check before it kisses the mahogany grain Said they wanna see you rise, they don't want you to rain I showed you all the tricks of the trade All I ask for is your loyalty My dear protege I'll be your father figure I drink that brown liquor I can make deals with the devil Because my check's bigger This love is pure profit Just step into my office They'll know your name in the street Leave it with me I protect the family I saw a change in you
