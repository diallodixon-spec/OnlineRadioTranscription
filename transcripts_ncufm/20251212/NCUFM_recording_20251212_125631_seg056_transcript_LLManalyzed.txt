20251212 125631 waiting but a transition. I must thank my second mate, Abigail Bethune, the brilliant producer behind Cruisin, as well as the new sports and current affairs team. Yes, beloved cruisers, we have come to the end of another cruise. We have dropped anchor and it's time to disembark. I really hope you enjoyed the hymns today. But don't despair, your life is like a cruise, Miss Annie, Auntie Sharon, Juanita Ramsey in Portmore. Thank you so much for having sailed and cruised with me.
