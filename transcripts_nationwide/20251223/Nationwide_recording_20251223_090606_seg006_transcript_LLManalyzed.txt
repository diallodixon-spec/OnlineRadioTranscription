Yes, yes, I found snapper and grunt. Plus they have some mutton and the price is not too bad. Really? Take up some. We can at least pinch it that way we can have some variety. Mummy, you buying ham? No, your father bought it already. It's at home in the freezer. Just need some seasoning and some ingredients to make the sauce. Well, we seem to get everything on the list. Except for vegetables. Okay, let's go look over that section to see what's there. Okay, just need cabbage, carrots and cucumbers to make the salad. See if you find any of those. Mummy, I see everything in the fridge. Just pick up some nice ones so we can make a good salad. If you see purple cabbage, take up some, at least one of those, right? I want to make the salad look nice and colourful. Okay, I think this is everything
