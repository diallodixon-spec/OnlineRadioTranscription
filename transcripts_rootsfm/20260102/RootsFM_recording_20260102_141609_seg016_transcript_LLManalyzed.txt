20260102 141609 I've been waiting for so long, now I finally found some hope to stand by me. We saw the writing on the wall, and we felt this magical fantasy. Now with passion in our eyes, there's no way we could disguise it. So we take each other's hand. Just remember You're the one thing I can't give you up So I'll tell you something It's gonna be love
