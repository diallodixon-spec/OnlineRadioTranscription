20251215 135533 She celebrated her special day yesterday, the 14th. Her son Ian also celebrated his birthday on the 14th as well. Trust that your days are very good. These greetings are coming from the family and friends. Your most welcome family. Thank you guys for keeping it locked to the Big 94. Johnny and Kenneth, can you please send a belated birthday to my biggest brother, Junior Leslie, who celebrated his birthday yesterday. It's coming from Devon. Big up yourself, Junior Leslie. Every time. It sounds like a cricket name, don't it, Kenneth? Yes, it sounds like a batsman. Midlander, batsman. I think that's what the West Indies needed, right? Kindly send birthday greetings to my one and only daughter, Evanique Thompson aka Samoy of Content and Old Harbour Primary School. It's coming from your dad, Everol. Wishing my baby girl all the very best in life and love you loads. Beautiful message there.
