20260102 215635 School fee money me give you I always make you happy I will never make you blue But what the hell the police can do? What the hell the Police can do? Ask you if you love me you say I do Leave the baby got nothing and I do And for me job me a friend and a school When you leave me I don't know what to do I do what me think just to come to. I will never ever turn my back on you. Just remember that I could go there too. Listen, look, I pay back, let me too. But what the hell the police can do? What the hell the police could do? Look, I laugh at me, feed at me, close you. Give you everything you have to comfort you. Leave me your scoundrel. Look me and you When we come back you got red, white, blue Jumping on your eye and it's black and blue Don't go to the police, go tell them it's you But what the hell the police can do?
