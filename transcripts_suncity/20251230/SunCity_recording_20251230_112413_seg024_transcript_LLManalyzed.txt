20251230 112413 Hey, hey, hey, hey. Hey, hey. my turn to strike a line. Gotta buy a man can, but not for a ride on a tight like a man can. I'm slow, don't you know that? Sick or not, we're not the E.R. or V.A. I'm not your thug, I'm the axle of V.A. All my girls are looking for a break. Anyway, I don't plan on levitating. I do this every day. Y'all know what you're called, V.A. Fight, ceremony, regulate. Never hear a C.R.V. or C.T.P.S. I'm a style so sick. Yeah.
