20260101 133322 I call it grace, grace, grace Grace brought me here, God, it was for your grace Times I've been lost and broken And like I would've never made it through the day But I know God has spoken And He promised not to leave me Never knew you'd still be here Never knew you'd still be safe Never knew you'd smile again Never know you'd hope again So I'm standing here today singing How did I get here I call it grace, grace, grace Grace brought me here If it wasn't for your grace
