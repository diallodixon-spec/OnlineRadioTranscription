20251225 144427 There are many Jamaicans without shelter and experiencing hardship as a result of Hurricane Melissa. Yet, the Christmas story reminds us that even in these moments, life, hope, and renewal can still emerge. And in the spirit of hope and renewal that defines this season, the government of Jamaica is advancing a comprehensive program of support aimed at rebuilding homes, restoring livelihoods, and strengthening affected communities. Already, the JDF and engineering corps from other supporting countries are in some communities repairing roofs of the most vulnerable persons. By mid-January, we will begin issuing rebuilding and rehabilitation grants scale to the assessed level of damage. And we will continue to offer relief support to those assessed as being in need. 2025 has been a faith-testing year.
