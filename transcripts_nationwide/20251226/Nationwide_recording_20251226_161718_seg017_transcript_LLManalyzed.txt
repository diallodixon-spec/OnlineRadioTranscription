20251226 161718 Love you till I die, love you till I die And that's no lie, break, break right down Get you out my mind, wherever you may be I'll surely find, I'll surely find Make no fuss, just start the fight Spend a little more tide, let me clear up my mind Get out of my sight, let me clear out my mind Get away from me, let me hear you shout I'm waiting for you to find me, I'm out of time I'm ready, brave, fighting back, I'm feeling so fine I'm looking back, I'm losing my mind, this will be the end of you The lion, the monkey, get chugged Bunga, don't get bummed, it bunga bonga bonga. Red red wine, you give me nothing if you know the world. You're telling me that I love you as if I'm a ghost. Red red wine I love you right from the start. Right from the start, fuck with that. Red red wine you give me one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen, seventeen, seventeen, eighteen, eighteen, nineteen, twenty.
