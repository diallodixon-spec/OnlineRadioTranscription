20251212 175142 We get sold Can't speak it twice, I hurt And our love burns bright Like a fire With the soul explode With desire I'd go crazy I'd go crazy Without your love You're my favorite drug Cause your love feels warm In the winter, what I feel with you You're my love, grow stronger each day Don't hurt me just because you know I'll forgive Girl my love grows stronger each day baby Please don't hurt me
