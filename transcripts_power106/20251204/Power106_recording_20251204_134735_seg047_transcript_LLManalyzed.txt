All right, we're back with you. Max, somebody is asking you when you talk about Andrew, how come Trump called people garbage? And you know all the things that Trump has done. So I don't think we have anybody in Jamaica, in the parliament or anywhere that behaves in the way that Donald Trump has done. As I say, he has valued the role of not only the American presidency, but leadership on a global level because people now feel that it's alright to curse a bad word or it's alright to be insulting of people in the parliament etc. I could never imagine getting such a behind it from Leeds but as much as it hurts that's the beauty of English football.
