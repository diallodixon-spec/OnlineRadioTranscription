20251226 113420 Now, ever since I can remember, there's been chatter that microwaves might cause cancer? Well, there's no credible source that confirms that claim. Now, what scientists are saying is that microwaves use what's called safe radiation, the kind that simply makes water molecules in food vibrate to create heat. I don't know how true that is either, but I know what I can tell you. The container you heat your food in matters too. So then it's not just a case about the microwave itself, but now it becomes a matter of the container you choose to reheat your food in. The wrong container can melt, leach chemicals or even spark. The right container keeps your food safe and your microwave happy.
