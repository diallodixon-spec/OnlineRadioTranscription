20251224 145753 That's how I will not really leave you with this one. This one is Glacier Robinson. It is not. It's not over now. I'm gonna leave you with Shirley Caesar. He will do it again. So don't ever give up. I hope you all feel blessed, hope you all feel purified in the name of the Almighty God himself, all right? Gotta make way for the E-Zone, you know, carrying boyer things there up until 5 p.m. So don't move the dial, the vibes continue. I wanna say Merry Christmas when it comes, guys, and a Happy New Year, and make everybody reach 2026, all right? Let's see you 2026. Keep safe on the road. If you're going out to party, of course, party responsibly. No bother with the recklessness. Especially the drivers, them. Do not drink and drive. Okay? Don't drink and drive. Get on yourself a designated driver. That's all.
