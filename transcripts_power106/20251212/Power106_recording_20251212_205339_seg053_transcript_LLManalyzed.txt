20251212 205339 We too have just become There's nothing we can't overcome If you let me be your you're one and only, one and only Some people spend a lifetime looking for that special me I'm so glad my search is over, darlin' I'm so glad that we've been together again. I'm glad if I'm the one who will love and stand by your side.
