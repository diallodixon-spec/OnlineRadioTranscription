20251218 093427 I'm not sure what is happening. I'm not hearing anything from the Water Commission to sort of bring me up to date what's really happening. Why we don't have no water. Is it a solar water treatment plant? Yes. Has that been commissioned, opened, started working? Not to my knowledge. So hold on there. Yes, because that was a while back earlier in this year and I thought by now you guys up in Red Hills would have been benefiting from that plant we don't start enjoying nothing of it yet oh lord i don't think all right so what's the problem and you see about 10 days now yes yes
