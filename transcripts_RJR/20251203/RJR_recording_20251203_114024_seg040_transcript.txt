I'm here, you know, playing catch-up, you know, wrapping up the semester and those things at school. Full day? Yes. Friday? Praise God. Belated birthday greetings to you. Yes? You were talking about someone. When I came on, the back end of the discussion, you were of them who works here and then there's this family that's a real dedicated set of listeners. And then there's a friend who have been friends since my undergrad years. Never forgotten each other's birthday. Maybe once we might have in 40 odd years.
