Like yourself, like yourself, like yourself So you can jump up and do what you want and I go up and do what I like, yeah And it's your filter wipe on everybody inside, yeah Like yourself Like yourself Like yourself But till the party done Boy, don't try to run alive And you don't try to stop me vibe, so don't say. You do what you want, I do what I like. You will not get no change. Because when it comes to party, I is such a man. And I know when we come to party, we don't have a plan. You don't tell me why I know I want you, but why I know you like me?
