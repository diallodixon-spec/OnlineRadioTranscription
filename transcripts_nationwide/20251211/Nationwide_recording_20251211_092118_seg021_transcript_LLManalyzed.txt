you Good morning, good morning, good morning. You're back here inside the Consumer Hour on Nationwide 90 FM. I am Nora Gaye-Banton. I did tell you that after the break, we will be joined by the Concealer Queen, Nora DeBarre Lewis, and she is in studio with me. Good morning to you, Madam Concealer Queen. Good morning, Nora. How are you? It's amazing. I'm doing great. Good. And I made it to in studio. Can you imagine? Right, you're here. You're here.
