I'm looking for the danger inside I said I like I'm dangerous I want someone to step to me I want someone to rescue me I've never been afraid of love I'm cry like I'm dangerous Oh yes, I want someone to rescue me Oh yes, I've never been afraid to love you Oh yes, I feel like starting something You got my engine running You got the keys to turn me on at once
