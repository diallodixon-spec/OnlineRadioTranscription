Well, you have had stories of police doing other things too, sir. I saw the news last night where one of the victims was saying that the policeman probably should get a harsher punishment than the others because he should be setting a better example. I think he shouldn't get punishment. I don't know if he was unconsoling because sometimes I did fire him and I don't know what to say about it but if I could console him and make him keep in job a little bit.
