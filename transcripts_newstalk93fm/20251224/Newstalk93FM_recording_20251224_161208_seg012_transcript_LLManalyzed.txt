20251224 161208 If I ever let you down, my friend, it was a misunderstanding. So if I took it for granted, you're not promised from today. I go jump like I never jump, wave like I never wave, wind like I never wind before, just to show you I'm solid, I'm solid. And I need you back in my life. You got people by the truck, Emotions running high. We are up in the sky. Tears running down we eye. Can't you tell that we sorry? We sorry. And we need you back in we lie. I need you back, I'm back home. Come home to me, come on to me. Come on to me. I, I, it's time to bless the good. Come to me, come to me. Come to me.
