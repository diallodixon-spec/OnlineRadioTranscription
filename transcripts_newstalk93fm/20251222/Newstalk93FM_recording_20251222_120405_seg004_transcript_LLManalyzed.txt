I could overshare, darling. You could overshare. But we could meet in the middle and start a back-and-all. Play in the middle, hey. What we gonna do now? Jam to a rhythm and eat a carnival. But baby, hey, what we go do now? Start a wine on it. I say compromise on it. Baby, spend time on it. I say compromise on it Baby, spend time on it, I said compromise on it
