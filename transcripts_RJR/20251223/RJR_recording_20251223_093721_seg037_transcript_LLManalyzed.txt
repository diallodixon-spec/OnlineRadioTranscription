20251223 093721 There's a lady who was emailing me and they said that the problem was resolved but it was never resolved. The real issue is that I have to pay my bill and I've been paying my bill ever since and particularly from March this year. I can't browse, I can't use the data but if I don't pay the bill, the full bill, I can't make calls either. And it is on sale. I can't pay half of the bill. I did not, because once I called the radio program like I'm doing today, Flo contacted me 24 hours, which is commendable. And they emailed me and called me and called me an email me and sent me into an office but they were not able to resolve it so I all right yes I agree what is this see that doesn't make a form it would be a form of report to the OER
