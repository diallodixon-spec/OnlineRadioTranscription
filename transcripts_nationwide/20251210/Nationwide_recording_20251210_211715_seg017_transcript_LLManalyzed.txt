If I can't ever give me a reason to leave, I'd be able to move on, you know. If a man ever give me a reason for leaving, baby, then I'm done with you here on the ground with you. Honestly, you make me feel like P.M.D. Senate. Why you make me? When it is evidence. You got to be here, come check. You know what? She cry because right now, me and her so over. Please stop it. Miss me lily cup and your pretty light like. Wonder who you woman who's up with your white light. By right, with no fear, see you suck and me already out.
