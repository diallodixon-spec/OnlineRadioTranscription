20251230 111107 grace that I can make it after all this life is over and my labor here is ended I will climb up on the mountaintops so tall Looking over in that city where my shaver is preparing Give me grace that I can make it after all I know where I am going, I know I know where I am going, I know. I know where I'm going now. Oh, there'll be joy bells ringing, happy children are singing.
