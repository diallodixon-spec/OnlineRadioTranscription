============================================================

And you say I am hell When I am falling short And when I don't belong Oh, you say I am yours And I believe Oh, I believe What you say of me I believe The only thing that matters now is everything you think of me In you I find my worth, in you I find my identity You say I'm loved When I can't feel a thing You say I'm strong
