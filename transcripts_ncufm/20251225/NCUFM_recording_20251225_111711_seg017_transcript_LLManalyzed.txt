20251225 111711 We are united in Jesus Christ. We are the soldiers of the light. We don't rest on flesh and blood, but bring the palaties of the dark. We do a marching to one week world By the blood of Christ the lamb. We are united in Jesus Christ. We are the soldiers of the light. We don't rest on flesh and blood, but principalities of the dark we do.
