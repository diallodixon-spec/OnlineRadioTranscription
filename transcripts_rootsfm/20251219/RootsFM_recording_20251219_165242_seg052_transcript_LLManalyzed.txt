20251219 165242 I'll always be around I think I better give myself some time Cause something tells me it's not over You're everything I dreamed of in my mind, my mind I think I'll never let you walk away I know that we will last forever Cause in my heart I know you feel the same The same Just one kiss was twice as sweet
