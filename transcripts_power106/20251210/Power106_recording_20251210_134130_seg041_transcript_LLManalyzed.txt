not just improvement in water and standing up beside a road and saying clap it do they really do what they're elected to do which is improve the lot of their constituents maybe if they did that it wouldn't be incumbent on them to have to attend the nine eyes and whatnot so but I still say it's not an easy job.

How are we to produce with this type of system?
