2025-12-11 20:12:05 What's my name? I'm Jamaican Dads. You're gonna say you're Jamaican Dads? Yeah. Alright, so you're Jamaican and I'm Dads. I'm Alan Campbell. And we are... Jamaican Dads! Good evening to you all, wherever you are. Good evening to all the very many people who we bump into on a weekly, monthly basis who tell us how much they enjoy this podcast. Thank you very much for tuning in, as always, whether it is that you're tuning in on a Thursday evening or a Sunday evening. We just enjoy meeting up as Berger and linking up on our ends, which sometimes, well, that's exactly what we're doing right now. And, you know, we're having a few drinks every now and again. And yeah, and we talk about matters relating to parenthood from a father's perspective. I can't claim to be every father. That's exactly what I was thinking.
