20251218 135738 and Growers Choice Avery's Organic Fertilizer. Alright, thank you very much Jesse Blake. You threw to us just in time for Christmas. Thank you very much for that. We've had a good time here in the Yard, Christmas Farmers Market in the Yard and it's great to see some of our farmers. I'm not going to use the word resilient because it is overused by our politicians and are tired out, but it is great to see that some of the produce that is available to us here at the farmers market and we already just already paid thanks to everybody associated with the team. Alcia I know is involved as well in getting some of these farmers because of her farm talk program
