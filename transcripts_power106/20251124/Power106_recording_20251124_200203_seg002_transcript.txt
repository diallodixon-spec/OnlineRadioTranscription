And for these we ask, not of our will, but thine, be done, and do so humbly, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. Thank you, Brother Medley. And I am Sister Paulette Blake. I'm the Assistant Communication Director. And to follow our running order for this press launch, I will now turn the time over to Sister Rae Richards-Peart, who is our National Communication Director for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Jamaica.
