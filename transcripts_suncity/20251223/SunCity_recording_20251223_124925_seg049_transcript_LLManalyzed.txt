20251223 124925 Hello, Mommy. Hello, Mommy. We're here, Mommy. You'll be okay, Mommy. Find your way, Mommy. Let me taste, Mommy. You're okay, Mommy. When I'm underneath the bright lights. When I'm trying to have a good time. Cause'm good now you ain't mine Na na na na Don't call me up When you're looking at my photos Getting hot, losing control You want me gone, now I let go Na na na na I'm over you And I don't need your lies no more Cause the truth is I like you boy, I'm stronger And I know it's sad that I changed if I go home But if it's your game then let's go zoom over you Don't call me out, I'm going out tonight Feeling good now you're out of my mind
