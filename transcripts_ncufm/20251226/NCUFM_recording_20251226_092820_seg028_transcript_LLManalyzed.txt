20251226 092820 Where can I be? And sinful I am Though I messed up sometimes I'm falling down again The way that I go And disobedient I am Though I tried many times I'm falling down again There is one thing I know And one thing I need That the Saviour wants to live inside of me Our Father loves me He wants to save me He wants to change that wicked man That is within me The father loves me
