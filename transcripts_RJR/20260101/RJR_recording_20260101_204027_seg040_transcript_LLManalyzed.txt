20260101 204027 Just like a king Love you give to me, sorry Makes me give in Girl just like made me just feel your love Keeps falling in If it's about the love you find for you I have to win To prove to you my love So deep within It. It's seven years and deeper, since I reached wisdom. What am I longing for? My baby's telling me more. What am I longin' for? Will my baby not release the call? What am I longing for? This is 84.5, and that's what I'm longing for. You're listening to Kamau James. When, when, when, when Can't we see each other walkin'?
