Talk to us Ishamma. I'm having a little bit of trouble hearing you clearly. I'm not hearing you so clearly. To be honest with you, this year I've had a few injuries actually that I am now recovering from. So that first word game event, I don't really like to speak on injuries because I don't really, unless my foot is broken, I don't even think about it. Like I'm always pushing as hard as I can regardless. But another big part is just equipment and being on the right boards for the right conditions. And this year has taught me a lot in that regard.
