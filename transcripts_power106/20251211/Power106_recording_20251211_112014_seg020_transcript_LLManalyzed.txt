And you know what people do in the end? People just fling up their hands in the air and say, light is light is light, business is how it come. Because we do not pay attention to these kind of things generally. And we just say, yeah man, everybody that do a good job, make a move on. So, everybody that does a good job, but we're not in a house yet. Everybody that does a good a job, but we don't know how much it costs us to get back to life. Everybody I do good job because a man come out and say I'm Apache Road. Meanwhile, when I drive, I drop in a pothole and he nearly end up in a china. There's a pothole. Everybody is just doing a wonderful job. It's not a problem. Because our estimation and our demands are so low that it doesn't really matter. So guess what? Politicians only just do what they do. No problem. $50 billion.
