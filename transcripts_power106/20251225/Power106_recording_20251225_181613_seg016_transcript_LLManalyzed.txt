20251225 181613 Where is Santa Claus? It's Christmas Eve I know that I should be the sleeping But maybe he's not far away So out of the window I'm pepee Hoping to see him in his sleigh I hope he won't forget To crack his castanets And to his reindeer say Oh Pancho, oh Vixen, oh Pedro, oh Blitzen Ole, ole, ole, ole Mamacita Donde esta Santa Claus? Oh where is Santa Claus? It's Christmas Eve.
