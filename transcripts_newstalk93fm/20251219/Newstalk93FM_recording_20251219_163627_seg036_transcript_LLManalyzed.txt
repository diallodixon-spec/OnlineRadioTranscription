Your thoughtless ambition sparked the ignition on foolish decisions, which led to misguided visions, led to fulfill your your dreams You had to get rid of me I protect the family I was your father figure We drank that brown liquor You made a deal with this devil Turns out my check's bigger You wanna fight, you found it I've got the place around it You'll be sleeping with the fishes Before you know you're drowning Who's portraits on the mantle? Who covered up your scandals?
