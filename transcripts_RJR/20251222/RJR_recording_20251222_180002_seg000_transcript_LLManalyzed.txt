20251222 180002 of negative and football was the only positive at that moment I could I really find something to focus on to take around me and also I think it was good that it resumed that also a lot of players on the last season they needed the opportunity to go to show their talent to go to colleges or professional contracts or whatever so I think it was great for us to give us that opportunity to showcase our talent and to build a life outside of school or outside of football, even school, abroad or whatever. So I think it was a great opportunity. I'm very happy that it was resumed. Gonna have to leave it there. Thanks so much to all of you for talking to us.
