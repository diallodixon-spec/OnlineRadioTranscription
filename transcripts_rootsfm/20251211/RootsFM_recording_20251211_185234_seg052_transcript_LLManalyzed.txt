2025-12-12 04:38:14 And I'll pretend that it's for you the way you want me to Please tell me a lie When you're lying close beside me And whisper when you hold me Sweet words like I love you Won't you tell me a lie when our night is almost over? Make it easy on us both when it's time for you to go. Come on, tell me a lie. Say you'd really like to stay. Come on. Tell me just one more lie. You'll be back one day. Tell me just one more lie You'll be back one day Tell me a lie When you take me home Tell me a lie I don't really wanna spend the night alone Tell me a lie
