20251223 173318 Here is a Christmas road safety tip from your friends at Power 106 FM. Use pedestrian crossings and stay alert at night. Darkness and busy streets make it harder for drivers to see people crossing. Always use designated pedestrian crossings and wait until vehicles fully stop. Drivers should also reduce speed and stay alert in shopping areas. That was a Christmasable material away from heat sources that can potentially ignite the material. Store material in approved containers and well-ventilated areas. Use caution when handling candles, matches, lighters, and other potential fire starters, and never leave them unattended when in use.
