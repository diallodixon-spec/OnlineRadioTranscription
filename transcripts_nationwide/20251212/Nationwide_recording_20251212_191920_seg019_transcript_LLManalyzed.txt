20251212 191920 on and we've not been able to get any of the representatives, the officials from the St. Thomas Moore Prep School. Yeah, that's the name of the institution, St. Thomas More Prep School. The ministry hasn't issued a press release on this matter either. We've been trying to get someone from the Ministry of Education as well. We also tried for the opposition spokesperson from the people's national party and I gather that's David Crawford. We weren't able to get him to come on either but Stuart Jacobs is with us. Top of the evening to you Stuart Jacobs, thank you so much for joining us. Thank you so much Stuart Jacobs. So sorry we weren't able to make a contact with you earlier but you have the lay of the land
