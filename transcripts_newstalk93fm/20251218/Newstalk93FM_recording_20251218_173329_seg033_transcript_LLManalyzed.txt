20251218 173329 Hold on, hold on Leave me unread, babe, but I still get the messages Instead of lines, three dots, but I can connect them And if it ain't right, babe, you know I respect it But if you need time, just take your time Honey, I get it I get it I get it The way you got me all in my head I think I'm glad that you're in my bed Whatever it is, you know I can take it Counting the days, how many days till I can see you again Throwing kisses like will you catch up my night? I'm cute but with arrows babe, I'm just shooting my shot If I could get in, drive me a pen Hop in the coupe and come over Don't wanna be friends just in the skin I wanna get closer and closer and closer
