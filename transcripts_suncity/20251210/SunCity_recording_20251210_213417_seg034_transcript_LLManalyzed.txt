We have not reached everybody yet. Our database shows that we have about 15,700 persons in those areas, and so we have not gotten to all of them as yet. But over time, with the assistance of the agencies who are also helping us with the assessment, I'm sure we will get quite a number. And for those who are displaced, maybe have gone to another parish or so, we will learn about it along the journey. But this is not an overnight, a three-month journey. Christine Hendricks. That's it for today's feature. Thanks for listening. I'm Cheryl Johnson Hamilton.
