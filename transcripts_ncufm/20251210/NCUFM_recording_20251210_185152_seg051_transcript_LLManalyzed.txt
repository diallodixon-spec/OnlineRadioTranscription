My home that I built for many years. I don't have it What is gonna happen? Thank God that I have been promised a new home. Will it come? God says I will heal your wounds Folks are grieving and grief is not just with death anything that you lose you grieve If you lose your health you grieve if you lose your finances you experience grief But God says I will restore health unto thee and I will Heal thee of thy womb say the Lord This is not merely a promise for ancient Israel It is heaven's hope for Jamaica, for our churches, for church members and non-church members, for our families and friends, for everyone who is hurting, for every hurting heart this evening.
