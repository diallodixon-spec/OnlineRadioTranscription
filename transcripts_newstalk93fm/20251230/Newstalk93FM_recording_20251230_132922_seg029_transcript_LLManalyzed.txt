20251230 132922 London. London. I'm feeling vibes on vibes. I'm a freaking dynamite. I blow your condo lights. You know I'm just that type. No, them nothing kill my vibe. Them nothing kill my vibe, them nothing kill, them not thinking. Why is my side full of the stars? Yeah, you should find a piece of advice. If you hit your enemies, enemies shine. If you're not a friend of me, enter the light. Cause you can never kill my vibe. Cause there is no sacrifice. Everything was taken. Still had to make it. Vibe killer, me and you go take it Vibe killer Somebody can protect my energy From your bad aura that my pastor say I be my healer, everything I desire I go deceive My rhythm, flow like a river If you get your work, come on go and sit down
