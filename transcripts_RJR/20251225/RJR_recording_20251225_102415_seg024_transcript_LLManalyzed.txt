20251225 102415 will be a very special Christmas for me. And this Christmas will be a very Christmas for me. Ooh, yeah. Merry Christmas. Happy Christmas. A regular Christmas. Yo, it's a island Christmas. Island Christmas. Jamaican Christmas. Oh, it's a island Christmas, jamaican Christmas, it's a caribbean Christmas, you're a gum-up in Christmas. Come on by the side of the haze and cry, as we're singing.
