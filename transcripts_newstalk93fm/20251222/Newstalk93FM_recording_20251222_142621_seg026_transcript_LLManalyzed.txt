20251222 142621 I feel messy. If I broke down my business, I like I know it go right, too. For like every night, too. I've been drinking more for the past five days Did you check on me? Now did you look for me? I walked in the room, eyes are red and I don't smoke banga Did you check on, did you check on, now did you notice me?
