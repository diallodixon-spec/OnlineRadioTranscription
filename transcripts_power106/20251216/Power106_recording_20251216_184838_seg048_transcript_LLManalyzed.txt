20251216 184838 Absolutely, and I was a referee back in the day, so most challenges from behind. Once that was taken out of the game, it also made our jobs a lot easier. I want to talk a little bit now about the England Premier League. There's a program that I do, Tim, on a Friday. We look at the England Premier League, and I'm an expert analyst, and I am looking at the top ten. What I see week after week is teams leapfrogging, but the team, okay, we have Arsenal out front, City now looking at real-life threat. But from one to ten, I am seeing some things happening there and a couple of surprises also in European provisions, I would think. It's a very surprising season, isn't it? I haven't really made sense of it yet. One conclusion that I've come to, and I don't watch that much of it because I watch much more South American football, one conclusion I've come to is the sides, for example, the sides that have been promoted, they have learnt from the lessons of the previous sides in their position.
