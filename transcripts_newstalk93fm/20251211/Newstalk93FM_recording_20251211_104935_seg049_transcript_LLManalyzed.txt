Are we getting that commitment from Moreland Morgan as a part of that? Very well. So let me respond by saying this Mr. O'Brien. Based on the representation made by the JPSCo and based on the assurance that it provided to the Energy Minister and by extension the Cabinet, the determination at this time is that by the end of January, latest early February, energy will be restored for the people of Jamaica who would have had their electricity disrupted by the possible hurricane Melissa. Perhaps save and accept people who are inaccessible or you know pathways have not yet been carved out to get to them. Save and accept that. So I have spoken to you with executive authority a while ago and I've spoken to you in very clear terms. We have given the JPS court a five-year loan at five and a half percent to bring back light to the people of Jamaica, Mr. O'Brien.
