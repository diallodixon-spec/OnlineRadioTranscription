And then me, my mother and my brother, because my grandmother, my grandmother have pain in her knee, she have pain in her shoulder. All people really hard to move. Sometimes they are really stubborn. She was crying, she didn't want to go in the room, so as I said, they didn't want to move. All the people were stubborn, but you eventually got her to move? Yeah. And everything was okay after that? No, but we still had to go in the rooms that were zinc and take out the mattresses, the beds, but we left the bed.
