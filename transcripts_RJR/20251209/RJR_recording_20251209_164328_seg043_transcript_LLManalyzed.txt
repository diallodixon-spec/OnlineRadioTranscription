Just to think about it I would do things that I regret trying to get you to understand how I felt for you I tried a hard time and time again but I didn't know our love wouldn't grow I should have just let it go but I stayed around thinking you would learn to love and we both know you're wrong there's nothing you can do to ever undo what you've done Oh I couldn't do without it I thought I needed you in my world But more and more I look out for you
