I don't think we are going to do Jesus take the wheel right now. We are going to do make away. Yes, it's Germaine Edwards of course. God will make away. So, blessed assurance and all the apostolates around. Of course, Widows Might and Jacob's Ladder and all of those apostolates that have been a gift of hope and all our apostolates, please take heart because God will make a way. Germaine Edwards to take us out.
