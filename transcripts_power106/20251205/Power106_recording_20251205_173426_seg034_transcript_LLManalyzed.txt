So if Santa does not show up for any old reason He will be happy just the same So I say Let's just have a Merry Christmas Don't make no war, don't make no fuss It's a time to love and reason Let's not fight or let's not cuss It's the season to be jolly True, where you're folly It's Christmas time again Bells are ringing, yes, it's Christmas Santa Claus is on his way
