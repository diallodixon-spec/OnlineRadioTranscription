20251226 140809 I'm still getting jealous I wish you didn't have to post it out I wish you'd serve happier When the morning comes When you see what we've become In the cold light of day We're a flame in the wind Not the fire that we begun Every argument Every word we can't take back Cause with all that has happened I think that we don't know the way that this story ends Then only for a minute I want to change my mind Cause this used to feel right to me I wanna raise your spirits I want to see you smile too Know that means I'll have to leave
