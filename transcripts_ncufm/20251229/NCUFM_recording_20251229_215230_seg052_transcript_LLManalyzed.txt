20251229 215230 You can use anything, Lord. You can use me. I want to be your surrender vessel every day. You can use anything. Lord, you can use me. Lord, take me to your hand. Take my hand, Lord, and touch my stormy heart. Touch my heart, Lord, speak to me. If you can use anything, Lord, can use me. Use me, Jesus, use me for your glory.
