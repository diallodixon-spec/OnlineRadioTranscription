20251212 181407 Why you don't want to give me artistic grammar? Why don't you want to give this ballast to an artist to Grammy. I'm gonja and I make all kinds of excuses. Give me the big bucks with the man of my code, me. Don't buy it from the young, you know I ain't a fool. When I'm out on the street, I don't even want to go home. Sometimes I feel like I'm in a hyper zone. I'm high up in the water. When time is important, we stay show.
