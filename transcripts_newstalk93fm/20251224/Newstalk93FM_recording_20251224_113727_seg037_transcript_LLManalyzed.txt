20251224 113727 I'm not coming home tonight. I'm not coming home tonight, not coming home tonight Don't sign in the party, girl don't send no set party to find me I'm not going home tonight, not going home tonight Cause I'm drunk in the party, so why don't you if I'll survive, song after song, wine after wine. I go sing a pitiful line. Weak like the masses, kryptonites. You can't find me, we're bound for shaking. High as heated, people bet it. Soca playing, if they want it, no.
