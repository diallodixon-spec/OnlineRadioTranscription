My fridge is full of food that my neighbors just brought. I have a tortilla that my neighbor upstairs brought in. Somebody else had brought a cake. The charm of Gracia is that. And I love it.

One, because, yeah, it wouldn I dream about I fantasize about it. Yeah I think all I'm left to do Coco is say thank you for having me in and I hope it chucks it down with rain tonight So that you can get a good night's sleep Thank you. I hope not because you you're here visiting and I want you to see Grazia in the Sun. It's beautiful, too
