20251226 184837 forever in your arms so secure no one else could do the love from you I don't want to let it go one more time tell me something sweet again say those words that tingles inside my head Cause I'm not afraid to let you know It's my first real love out of all of you My first real love and I don't wanna lose it now But every time we get so close I fear that love will lose us
