There's some abdication of basic responsibility. I feel like we have it backwards. But again, I understand. It's well intentioned. I just don't think it's being executed properly. No, I'm sure there are going to be numerous workarounds. Any tech savvy child is going to find their way around it. But I think it starts the conversation. Fair. And I think the conversation needs to start. How much access do you as a parent want your child to have to social media? How often do you leave your child in front of the screen? And that's why you as a parent need a parent.
