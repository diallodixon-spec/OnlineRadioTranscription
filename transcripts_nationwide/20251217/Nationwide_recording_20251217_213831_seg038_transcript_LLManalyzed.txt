20251217 213831 That's how we work out with Jamaicans because we already overcook everything. That is so true. What happened to good old chicken? Chicken is a must. Do you guys do like a big Christmas dinner as well? Because I've realized now that it's because once again, my mom is doing the cooking. Traditionally in my home, even if it's not on Christmas day, on a regular Sunday, dinner don't cook by one o'clock. Like 12 o'clock, one o'clock, like some people, five o'clock, six o'clock, no. So because she cooks very early, you know, Christmas dinner is perhaps, again, I can't saw fish, I like fried breadfruit, things like that, and then we want to make space in my belly for the whole lot of food that I'm going to eat, because sometimes, because of all the food, we don't really enjoy all of what is provided. So do you guys do a big Christmas breakfast with the Christmas dinner? No. No.
