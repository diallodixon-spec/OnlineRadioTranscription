baby when i met you there was peace i know i set out to get you with a fine-tooth comb. I was soft inside. There was something going on. You do something to me that I can't explain. Hold me closer and I feel no pain. Every of my heart We got something going on Tender love is blind It requires a dedication All this love for you
