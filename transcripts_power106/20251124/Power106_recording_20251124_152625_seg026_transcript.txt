So if your son is refusing to come off the title, you may have to end up taking him to court to try and get him removed. And even then, it's not a certain thing. Because let us say you put him on the title when he was a minor. You know, the courts protect, even though he's no longer a minor, but the courts look seriously into that. So you have to show that really he was just or is just a trustee but the point I'm making is simply because you think it's your property and you put someone on it doesn't mean that you can then now make decisions or you can get them to come off the property just like that so that's why you have to think carefully before you put anyone on your title even your own child even your spouse you have to be very careful so I'm sorry this is happening to you as unfortunate as it is you you may you may have to end up taking your son to court
