20251224 215033 It's Christmas, Christmas time, it's Christmas, it's Christmas time Yeah, yeah, yeah Shout it out on top of your lungs Three, two, 1, go! When it's Christmas time Oh when we set eyes Here we be flexin' all night Bought to straight the daylight Island Christmas just nice Bought me a drink with some ice Every Christmas morning Watch the kids them all performin' While them open up gifts The family vibe nice every time
