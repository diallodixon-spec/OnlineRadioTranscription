Caught a phallic shout, cause I got too wild, but now that's how I'm getting paid. Could I see your stage? I'm done hiding, now I'm shining like I'm gonna be We dreamin' hard, we came so far, now I believe We're going up, up, up, it's our moment. You know together we're going. Gonna be, gonna be golden. Up, up, up with our voices. Don't want to get you so wounded. Gonna be gonna be golden. Done hiding now.
