And she said, my brothers. And she spoke and I listened to her and I realized, you know something? We need some more female heads of state. Balance, you know. We need some more females. Yeah, but we get one in Trinidad. No, no, no, no. Not that one. We don't just need a female. We need one who will balance. Because we have one at Trinidad that is a complete disaster. Not that one! That one is about ATM machines. So it's not just about females, it's about balance, wisdom, yeah? Look for the madness where I go at. Can you imagine? No other trillionaire leader would have done that. That's where I'm supposed to turn in my grave for them to look and see where I go at this. But Rolly wouldn't do that. No, no, no, no.
