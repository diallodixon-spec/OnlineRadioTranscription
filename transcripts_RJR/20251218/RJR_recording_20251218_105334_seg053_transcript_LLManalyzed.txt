20251218 105334 your real name is Wayne, right? Yes. Yes. Um good morning and how are you doing? I'm very well. Thank you. When I came down here the last time, I remember one of the things you did, you came and asked me for some help for the farmers. So, you want seeds, right? Yes, yes. Right. Yes, and we are and you are here. I don't see another one here yet but we are grateful for what you have done and what you're still doing and what you're about to do. So, I brought a whole team from Rada Connect over there. Did you register? You have, okay, you already registered as a farmer, yeah? And your registration is up to date? Yes, yes. Okay, so down there, they're supposed to have seeds for you. What is it that you plant again, Cocoa Bread? Plant yam, banana planting, and a lot of things because I just do overall farming. Right. You raise chicken too and goat? Yes, yes. And how did they fare in the hurricane? Everything mash up? Yes, everything.
