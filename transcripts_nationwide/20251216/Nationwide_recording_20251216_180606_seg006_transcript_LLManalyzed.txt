20251216 180606 The OUR's regulation, answered Hewitt, is projecting the announced increase in electricity bills could last for the next six months. The fuel charge can flip to it. So there may be months in which the fuel charge drops significantly. And therefore, if you add this, it won't make a difference in terms of increase on customer bills. So we'll see how that works out. But ideally, we think six months. The OUR says a phased bill increase approach was being used to prevent a massive hike in bills at the end of the month. The OUR boss says that hike would have led to a significant increase in electricity costs for December. Meanwhile, the opposition People's National Party, PNP, is calling for greater clarity from the JPS regarding the expected increase in December bills. Philip Paulwell is the party's spokesman on energy. He says JPS has not provided critical details about its decision.
