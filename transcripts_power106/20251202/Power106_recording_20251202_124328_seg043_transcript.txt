And by February, everybody's supposed to get light, which JPS has already told them, say, watch out. It will take a round in June. So sit down with them and carry out an aerial survey, or whatever the case might be, and go and come up, build up people who will say, by February we're gonna get light. And some of the Platt, Miss Callum say, the count has called all the names, around four or five parishes, right? They must be restarted so that means they might be here in May, June nobody's going to get lighted because everything mash up That's why I said you don't just get up and say February we're going to get light and you don't carry out what is the structure where the supply comes from, how damaged it is, and how long it will take for it to be rebuilt. All right, cool. All right, my brother, blessings. Aye, aye, aye, aye.
