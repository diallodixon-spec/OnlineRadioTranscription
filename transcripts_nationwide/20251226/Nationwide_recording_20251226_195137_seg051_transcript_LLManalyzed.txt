20251226 195137 No pain, no gain Anything worth having at all is worth working for and waiting for Some of my closest friends have thought they had that thing on a string Just cause that man was bringing them flowers and candy and all kinds of gifts Honey, some gifts are just to make him feel better while he's on his guilt trip about the night before. You know what I mean. Especially when you know you haven't been doing the things you should do. Think about it. What is the man trying to tell you? Sometimes flowers mean maybe we should just be friends. Do you get my drift? Hang if you can hang, no pain, no gain. In order to get something, you gotta give something. In order to be something, you gotta go through something.
