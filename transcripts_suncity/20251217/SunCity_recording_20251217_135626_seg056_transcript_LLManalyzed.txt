I don't deal with no grass or green. Hold the pole, you know. What you know, it's time for a change. Each fish drop. Got children out of the dream. It's tasteful, you know. Watch and know, you know, side to side. Don't hold the tribe, bro. Burn me belly when I pull me pie. Well, take the boat, fine. Push your mouth like me bread ring here. Sell a pound of that thing here. And a Rambo too.
