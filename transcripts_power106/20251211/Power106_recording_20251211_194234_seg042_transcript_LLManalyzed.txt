It should be interesting. I had a coach a couple of weeks ago and he promised me that there are going to be a few surprises coming from the Blue Valley areas, hurricane or not. Can you expand on that in any way? Are you hearing the same thing? No, I tell you, I might not have my ears on a grown like that. But it's welcomed. We do recognize and we know that the history is that most of our top athletes are from rural Jamaica and predominantly from Western Jamaica. Our sprinters are predominantly from there.
