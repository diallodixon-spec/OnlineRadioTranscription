20251223 111613 Why nobody no believe in a love again Because every love that lost Nobody no believe in a God again Seems all faith is lost Nobody no believe and it hurts more Turn the lights on the world so dark Still I believe that love is everlasting. Yes, I know. Love is everlasting. I believe love is everlasting. I world's so dark. Turn the lights on.
