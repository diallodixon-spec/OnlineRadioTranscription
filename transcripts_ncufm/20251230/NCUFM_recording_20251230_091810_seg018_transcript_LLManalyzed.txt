20251230 091810 mentors, even those who challenge us, are part of God's refining work. Sometimes it's the encouragement of a friend that lifts us when we're weary, sometimes it's the correction of a loved one that keeps us on the right path, sometimes it is the quiet presence of someone who simply listens. Each one is a gift, sharpening us in many different ways. The promise here is that when we walk in fellowship, we are not left dull or weak. God uses our relationships to make us stronger. He promises growth through connection. That means every person he places in your life has a purpose, whether to teach, to comfort, to challenge, or to even inspire.
