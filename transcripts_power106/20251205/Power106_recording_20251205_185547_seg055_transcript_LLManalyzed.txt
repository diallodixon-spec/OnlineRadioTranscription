Spurs are on an enigma and every time I back Spurs to win they lose. And I think that Brentford have proven to be a team that is capable of reinventing themselves. So I can see Brentford going to Spurs and winning. Bournemouth have gone off the boil. They are not doing as well as they were doing earlier and I think that Chelsea will win this game. Yes. Alright, interesting fixers here. Leeds will be at Elland Road and Liverpool, not doing as well, as one might have expected of doing. Yeah, well, we saw what Leeds did to your team a couple days ago. That will help their confidence and Liverpool is just in a shambles now in terms of defending. So I think that I like Leeds for the win at home. It will probably be considered an upset by some people but I don't think it will be an upset if Leeds were to win.
