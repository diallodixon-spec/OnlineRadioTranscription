20251231 140405 Receiver Stefan Diggs is facing serious legal trouble after being charged with felony strangulation and a lesser assault charge, stemming from an alleged incident on December 2. In a statement released by his attorney David Meyer, Diggs categorically denied the allegations, describing them as unsubstantiated and uncorroborated. Meyer added that the claims stem from an unresolved financial dispute involving an employee. According to reports, the accuser is a woman who worked as Diggs's personal chef. A Massachusetts court has scheduled an arraignment for January 23 when Diggs is expected to formally hear the charges and enter a plea. Diggs signed a three-year $69 million contract with New England in March and remains one of the franchise's most high-profile players. Off the field, he recently welcomed a baby boy with his girlfriend, rapper Cardi B. And finally, in athletics, world champion Javelin thrower, Keshawn Walcott and sprinter Leah Bertrand were the top honorees at the Trinidad and Tobago Olympic Committees
