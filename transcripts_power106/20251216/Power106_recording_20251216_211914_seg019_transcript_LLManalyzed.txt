20251216 211914 in South Manchester, but there is no representative to come and even speak to us about the damage that has happened to us in South Manchester. No one. And when you go to the market, you can imagine Dr. Dumas, a one sweet pepper upon is $1,600 for a sweet pepper. Hot pepper is $130 per one. Cabbage, everything gone sky high. Remember, we down here in South Manchester don't have anything because we are being mashed up. But those who have it from other places, take it to Mandeville. You go to the supermarket, a pound of chicken is $500 per pound. Chicken foot is $350 per pound. Is there anything to smile about, Dr. Dumas?
