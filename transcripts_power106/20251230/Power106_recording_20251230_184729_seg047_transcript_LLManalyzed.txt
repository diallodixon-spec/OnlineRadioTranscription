20251230 184729 is that we have analyzed, you know, properly what needs to be done. We're working with the various stakeholders with respect to, or within the government, I should say, and as well as the stakeholders that exist outside of government to ensure that this is done in the shortest possible time. But rest assured, I can't give a timeline, but rest assured, we as a merger committee and all three commissions will be working as seriously and squarely towards getting this done once and for all. And whatever is needed to get it done, because we've seen the savings that can be garnered through the merger with respect to driving efficiencies, et cetera. And it only makes sense for all parties and all hands to be on deck to ensure that we get this done in the shortest possible time. How much can you tell us about your assessment of what has happened? Early days, but with Jamaica Racing Commission in particular, what are you seeing there?
