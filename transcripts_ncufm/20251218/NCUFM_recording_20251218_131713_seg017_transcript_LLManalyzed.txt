20251218 131713 I'll always love you for the rest of my day. What can I give in exchange for the love you've shown me? My very life just don't seem like it now But I'm glad they give to you And I'm throwing all away I'm so grateful that Your love is available It hears me when I call And it lifts me when I'm alone Lord, you are the love Worthy to receive such praise So I give you all of my life
