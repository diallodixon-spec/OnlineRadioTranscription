20251230 110604 It's current, informative, educational, and it deals with the issues. It's Teacher's Time. Coming up in Teacher's Time, Sunday, January 4, 2026. Join us as we invite the president of the Jamaica Teachers Association, Mr. Mark Malava, back to the microphone on Teacher's Time. This time, in his first broadcast for the new year, he will be using the opportunity to speak to the nation and to educate us island-wide. You, like myself, anticipate what such a well-positioned member of the teaching profession will bring to the fore. So here is my request to you. Place this notification in your To Listen list, and join me right right here on your Teacher's Time program, January 4 at 4.30 p.m. on this station, Raider Jamaica 94 FM. Teacher's Time brought to you by the Jamaica Teachers Association, Unite and Serve and the JTA Cooperative Credit Union
