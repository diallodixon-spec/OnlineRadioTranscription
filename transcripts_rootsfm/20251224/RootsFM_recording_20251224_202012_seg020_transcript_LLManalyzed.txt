20251224 202012 My best friend's having a party and everybody's going. I know it's gonna be a lot of fun. Oh, by the way, it's snowing. It's been a long, long time. And it's late while you close my mind. I guess it's just too late. Gee whiz, it's Christmas. It's funny that I haven't got to call you before And why is it I haven't seen you around anymore?
