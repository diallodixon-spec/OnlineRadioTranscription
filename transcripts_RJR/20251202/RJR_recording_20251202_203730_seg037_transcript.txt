I don't know what you're talking about, Dominic. Go mother was a midwife. I had a baby born here, but can't tell you about it. It's not going to take the program from me. No, the mother can make the baby overweight too by feeding. Right. Well, we're not talking about those aspects of it. We're really just trying to narrow in on the cerebral palsy. But you have anything else you wanted to comment about specifically for cerebral palsy? Is there anything else that you would like to share or learn or point out yeah man not a problem well thank you so much for your call and we continue to listen out for you
