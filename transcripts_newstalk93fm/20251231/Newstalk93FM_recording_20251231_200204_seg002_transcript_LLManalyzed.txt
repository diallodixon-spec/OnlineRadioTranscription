Corporate Communications Manager at the JUTC, Shantol Thompson, says the former express route was discontinued and the regular service, Route 610, was implemented based on commuter feedback. Yup, you weighed in on what's important to you, affordability and accessibility. When we had launched this route on October 1, we advised the public that it would be a pilot phase and it would be reviewed based on performance and feedback. So three months later, now that the pilot phase is over, we did some surveys and our commuters had mentioned that we want it to be a little bit more affordable. We want it to be from downtown because it's more accessible and also changing it from an express room to our regular route, we can now have more time. Ready to get on board? Let me tell you how much it will cost you. An adult fare using the SmartFair card is $500
