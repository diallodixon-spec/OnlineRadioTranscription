I die fast, fight fast Swear me lie for you Young king of pretender Something to remember She hunting for a spender The world freeze when I enter You're pretty like Dalek and you're placed at the center Missing your dream, I go chillin'za What a skin-tender, you look like my benzer She gon' surrender, I gon' caress ya Best friend ya, the love in her extend ya Know me what I know about themself Feel like love for the first time, first time Missed ya girl, me get the bright vibe Bright style, cute face with the bright smile, yeah Feelin' like for just, feelin' fine for just Spare me life for you, life for us, life in your eyes
