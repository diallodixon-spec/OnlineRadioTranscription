2025-12-11 18:59:16 Yeah, the season comes along and I'm alright But then I miss you Most at Christmas time In the springtime, those memories start to fade With the April rain Through the summer days, till autumn's leaves are gone I get by without you, till the snow begins to fall and then I miss you. Oh, it's that Christmas time and I can't get you. No, no, no, no.
