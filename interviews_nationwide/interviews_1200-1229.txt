**Interview with Dennis Chung, Head of the Financial Investigations Division (FID)**

In a recent interview with Nationwide News' George Davis, Dennis Chung, the head of the Financial Investigations Division (FID), discussed his recusal from the investigation into Prime Minister Dr. Andrew Holness's statutory declarations. Chung emphasized that his decision to recuse himself was made to ensure the integrity of the investigation, stating that "the system of accountability at the organization would make it impossible for any single individual to influence an investigation."

Chung also addressed concerns about his appointment to the FID, which had been met with criticism from the opposition party and some sections of civil society. He stated that he had gone through the proper process and had the support of the staff at the FID. When asked about the investigation into the Prime Minister's affairs, Chung revealed that he had deliberately kept himself out of the loop and had no knowledge of the inner workings of the investigation.

The FID head also expressed his faith in Jamaica's democracy and civil society, saying that "civil society is critical" and that "people might express their different opinions, but... we need to separate persons from organizations." Chung's comments come as the FID continues to investigate the Prime Minister's statutory declarations, which were handed over to the agency after the Integrity Commission's own probe found no evidence of wrongdoing.

**Interview with Hugh Faulkner, Commissioner of the Independent Commission of Investigations (Indicum)**

In a separate interview, Hugh Faulkner, the Commissioner of the Independent Commission of Investigations (Indicum), discussed the recent reduction in murders in Jamaica, which saw a 43% decrease in 2025. Faulkner attributed this decrease to the efforts of the security forces and other stakeholders, but also expressed concern about the number of fatal shootings by the police, which increased in 2025.

Faulkner emphasized the importance of preserving life and called for the hastened procurement and use of body-worn cameras by law enforcement personnel. He stated that "our duty is to investigate each matter on its merit" and that "preservation of life is desirable." The Indicum Commissioner's comments come as the agency continues to investigate fatal shootings by the police and work towards reducing violence in Jamaica.

**Interview with National Security Minister**

Although not directly quoted, the National Security Minister was mentioned in the transcript as saying that the historic decline in murders in 2025 is "a turning of the tide toward sustainable crime reduction." The Minister also commended the security forces and agents for their efforts, stating that "your collective efforts have changed the trajectory of our nation, placing us firmly on the path to long-term sustainable crime reduction." The Minister's comments highlight the progress made in reducing crime in Jamaica and the importance of continued efforts to maintain this trend.
