20251216 131208 Tears I cry now I can't get over it So don't you ever Let me down again Cause I'm depending on you So you better come through this time Please hear my cry and if I ever Let you down my friend It was a misunderstanding So I thought you'd get forgotten. Don't I promise from today I'll go drunk like I never drunk. Waved like I never waved. Wired like I never won before. Just to show you I'm sorry. I'm sorry. And I need you back in my life. Look at people by the truck. Emotions running high. We are not in the sky. Just running down we high. Can't you tell that we sorry? We sorry. And we need you back in we high. I need you back on the road.
