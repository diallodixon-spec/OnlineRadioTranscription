Hope I'm not rushing. It's just something that I can't describe. I've never met this type of guy. He turnin' up into something. I think I love him. I just wanna cuff him. Girl, you better get you one of these, yeah. Get you one of these. Wake up in the morning, he got flowers on my feet. Get one of these. Yeah, I don't wanna leave. Dance around him, got me like a puppet. I'ma let him pull the strings. Mm-hmm, get you one of this. Got a man to get you what you want, and he gon' give you what you need. Just saying, get you one of these, just saying, get you on of these. Like we're on the edges in the streets with me, he's so, so. Girl, I'd be ready to take my clothes off. Like, really? On a Friday!
