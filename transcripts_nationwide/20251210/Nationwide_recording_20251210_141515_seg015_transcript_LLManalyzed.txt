============================================================

I got a heart beat that's close to fever So life is broke boy, where you pose for me? Call it brave, but don't call it low One aim of the riches I'm a target of You're my target of See my family suffer cause my heart is broke People chase me that fast Fling up a castle, me **** blast the truck Riches are closer, pass the cup What am I saying again?
