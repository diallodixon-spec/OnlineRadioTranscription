20260101 124422 I tried to deny it, but I'm still in love with you. I miss you like crazy. I missed you like crazy. Ever since you went away, every hour, every day. I I can see the love shining in your eyes. And it comes as such a sweet surprise. It seems believing is worth the wait. So hold me and tell me it's not too late to shake it together.
