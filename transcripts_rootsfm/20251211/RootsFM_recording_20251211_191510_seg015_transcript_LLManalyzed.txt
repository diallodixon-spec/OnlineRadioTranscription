2025-12-12 05:23:49 you're a discontented mother and a regimented wife I've no doubt you dream about the things you never do but I wish someone had to talk to me like I want to talk to you I've been to Georgia and California and anywhere I could run Took the hand of a preacher man and we made love in the sun But I ran out of places and friendly faces because I had to be free I've been to paradise but I've never been to me
