to boiling the water is that we boil it at least for one minute. So as it starts boiling, you don't just hurry up and turn the stove off. You boil it for at least a minute. And Mr. Taylor did say, of course, that we are to ensure that the water is cool before we use it then to go ahead and take the medication. We don't want anyone to be harming themselves. So that's one, you know, way that can be used that is very efficient. Well, I'm happy I did the minute because in my head, I'm saying, okay, it's boiling. You know, I say, no, give it some time. That is a minute to boil. Okay. Okay. just to add Clive cool in the water doesn't necessarily mean you put it in the refrigerator I know that a lot of persons don't have electricity now so cool in the water means you just leave it
