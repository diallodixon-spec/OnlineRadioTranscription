Up and from the, from the, dem here some a can. Now change up the plan, get the New York party shot. It's a good look, right? Yeah, please. Yeah, yeah, yeah, forward. Quick, quick, quick, quick. Don't get it confused So I go to Hope Road and go link Viva. What good for your nerves, so what's a fan? Walking on the floor to feel what's off your heart. Nobody could have said rasta soft. Me go link Viva fast and never fever grass. It's Berlin, I will blend in so you know I'll be spending every dollar out and me will fall. A bottle of the green and I'll eat it all.
