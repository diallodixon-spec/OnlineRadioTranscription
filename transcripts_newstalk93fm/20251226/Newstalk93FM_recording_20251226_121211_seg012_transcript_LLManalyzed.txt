20251226 121211 Come on to me, come on to me Come on to me This is my apology Follow me, come and see What you mean to all of me You're a treasure in my eyes The greatest pleasure in my life Cause when you're living by the knee Honesty, hurry please Home is where the heart should be Pretty feathers in disguise so you better come through this time please hear my cry and if I ever let you down my friend it was a misunderstanding so if I took you for granted then I promise from today I'll go jump like I never jump
