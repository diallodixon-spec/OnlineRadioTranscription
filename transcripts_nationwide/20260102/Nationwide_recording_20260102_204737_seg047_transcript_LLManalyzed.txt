If it appeals to the audience, so if you're designing a website for a school, if it appeals to students, if it appeals the teachers, we grade for the functionality, so like the different links. So we know that we have some website. My students, they love the Apple site. It's very appealing to them. So if you can, when you click on the homepage, if it leads you to somewhere, when it clicks on the about page, if it leads to somewhere, that's functionality. So we grade on that. We also grade on link to an external source. So this is a part that they they they they go ahead and they create their instagram page and trust me they make they take it seriously they are not marked for the instagram page they just mark for the link leading to it and they take it so seriously that they go to the instagram page get followers and everything like that
