Now me cannibal friend friend, friend friend. Me cannibal friend friend friend, friend, now me cannibal friend. Until we meet up again. When we meet, meet, meet. Rumble beat, beat, beat. Things so sweet, sweet, sweet. Feel complete Love the way that you bring a vibe. With your hands, they're mopping it up.
