============================================================

I'm the best friend he's got I'd give him the shirt off my back He knows he can trust me with his life But each time he leaves me alone Leaves me alone with his wife I wish he didn't trust me so much I think he really trusts me too much How can he be so blind? We both got the same good taste He should know when he's gone, gone on his business trip Can't help watching this woman without losing my grip I wish she didn't trust me
