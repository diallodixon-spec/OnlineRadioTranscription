I put a smile on my face If I said you can never face And if you don't know me well, well, well You won't see how buried I am inside my grave Inside my grave Cause you see people, people, people People don't really know you, they don't really know cause you see people people, people They don't really know, they don't know I've been drinking more, oh for the past five days Did you check on me, now did you look for me?
