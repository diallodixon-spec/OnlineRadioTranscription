The beaches are nice, much nicer than ice. The rum is still fine, and so is the wine. So run and come to see your son. It's Christmas know what you're talking about. I'm not talking about you. I'm talking about you. You're not talking about me. You're talking about me. I don't want to talk about you. I want to talk to you. I want you to talk to me. I'm talking to you. You're talking to me.
