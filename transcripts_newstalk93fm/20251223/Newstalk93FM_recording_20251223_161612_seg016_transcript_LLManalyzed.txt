Give me that love. If you give me me, I'm not going to let go. Give me, make a girl my sample. Feelings got me hitting on the freaky dance floor. Diallo, diallo. If I give you my love. Make you not disappointed. I'll catch you from my door. Diallo, Diallo. If I gave you my love, make you not disappointed.
