20251216 164027 Mr. Grant from GPS, you know, said the complete destruction demolished the substation by Paradise, right? It was used solar, complete solar, now that it's mashed up. They must go to IPP. That's what he said, you know. Like from the first day, the electricity start mash up, they start mash up the place. Automatic, they must figure out, IPP, that's what he said. So, you know, that's why I said, and you mentioned it, said them have generators, what ever the case might be. Right? How long it takes for FIT-3P not how long they use it in IPP, because he never mentioned about the subs, he said automatic, they must have to use the IPP rate, which is almost three times the amount of load, what they would charge. They have JPS. Right.
