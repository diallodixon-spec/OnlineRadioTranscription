Don't you impose your values on me. It's judgmental people like you that need to realize that not everyone lives by your standards. Don't you care about your little boy? Of course I do. I always support his decisions and would never dream of judging him. Sometimes the most loving action is to show someone that what they're doing is wrong. If a friend is making harmful choices, do you care enough to let them know? Another message from Lifeline Productions, located on the web at lifelinepro.com. I'll see you guys in the next one.
