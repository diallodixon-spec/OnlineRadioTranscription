20260101 201007 I want to stand with you on a mountain I want to breathe with you in the sea I want to lay like this forever Until the sky falls down on me And when the stars are shining brightly in the velvet sky I'll make a wish, send it to heaven, then make you want to cry Tears of joy for all the pleasure and the certainty. It was surrounded by the comfort and protection of the highest powers. In the hours, the tears devour you.
