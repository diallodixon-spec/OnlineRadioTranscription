20251225 152110 Another year is about to close Happy memories filled with those Joy and laughter under mistletoes While kids are sharing toys and clothes Surrounded by the ones I love My favorite place to be Surely feels like Christmas to me Oh, hope you have a merry Christmas. Oh, and I hope it grants you all your wishes and all you dreamed of. A king was born distant.
