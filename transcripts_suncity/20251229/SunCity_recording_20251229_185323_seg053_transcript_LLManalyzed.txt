20251229 185323 Big up to the J-Safe members, hard at work, needed in the peace. Now I notice a lot of development going on, but I'm not seeing a new police station. We need more police posts all over the place, man. So when they call the officers, they can reach quick and fast. They want to see more fire stations being built as well. What about development? What about housing scheme? What about commercial complexes? They want to see football field and basketball basketball courts sporting grounds being developed as well more parks more recreational activity location and the most definitely we need some wider road yeah man expand the road then please and
