So come on out tonight And we'll lead the others On the ride through paradise and if you feel alright then we can be lovers cause I see that starlight look in your eyes don't you know we can fly and if we stay, we'll feel the rhythm of the evening picking us up high, never mind the weather. We'll be dancing in the street until the morning light.
