So you put them together and there's something interesting there. The problem is, with you in the middle, your lovely island in the middle, you will know this, the Americas are absolutely huge. The distances involved are massive. So there are logistical problems, but I do think that this is going to happen. And I just wonder, we're going to look ahead a fair few years now, but I just wonder if potentially a Pan-American competition involving Brazil, Mexico, the big teams from Argentina and the big teams from the United States, who knows? A team from Jamaica as well, who knows? Whether that could be a rival to the dominance of European club football? If it can be backed financially, then absolutely sure it's going to happen.
