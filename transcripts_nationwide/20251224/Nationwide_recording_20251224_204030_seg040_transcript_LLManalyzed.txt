20251224 204030 and I understand both sides but I just don't want to interfere like what they're putting them out of the school but as St Andrew High School says you guys are making this out of nothing because the girls don't have a problem with the edges being quote-unquote banned from the school yeah simply put the the biggest issue that a lot of people have with it is the fact that some schools are taking the the more harsh route of keeping the kids outside of the premises and as you said before that's something that should never happen but outside of that it also calls a question that has been looming over the Ministry of Education and just like when it comes on to culture and all of that for the longest while when it comes onto Jamaican school system is are we going to review the way in which we look at grooming and self-expression and just expression overall for our kids and how that melds into the school system because there are some parts of the sanctions and restrictions that exist that are bred out of colonialism and it's just a repetition
