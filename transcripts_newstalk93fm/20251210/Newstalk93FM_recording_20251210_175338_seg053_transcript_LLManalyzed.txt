============================================================

I believe that love is a powerful thing, feeling deep within. And if you believe in love, free up your mind, let me flow within. As early as the heart. Me pray that you don't hurt my heart. Can't no other girl, no hold me, hold me hold me so tight, baby. None of them ever please me, sir. Treat me, sir. Lord, you feel so right. No girl never squeeze me, squeeze me, squeeze, me so tight, yet, baby.
