20251231 102211 that it is okay to be who you are. And if them feel say, you're too much that are feeding business. And if they feel like say, they cannot manage you, that is their business. But be who you are, because when you are who you are, the right people will come. So stop pretending, stop wishing to be and be who you are, who God ordained you to be. The right people will come, the wrong people will leave. Be who you are. That is also something that I've learned for this year that it don't matter how you twist and turn, how you try to reshape yourself and how you try to be to please, you cannot and will never be able to please people. So be who you are and the right people will love you, the wrong people will go about their business.
