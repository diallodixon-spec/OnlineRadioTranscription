20251218 150100 Good afternoon, I'm Daydrain Gordon with the International Headlines. A former anesthetist has been jailed for life for intentionally poisoning 30 patients, 12 of them fatally. The 53-year-old was convicted Friday at the end of a four-month trial. It is one of France's biggest ever medical malpractice cases. The youngest victim was a four-year-old child. He survived two cardiac arrests during a routine tonsil surgery in 2016. The oldest victim was 89. Thailand says it has bombed a logistics center near the Cambodian town of Phopet, known for being a major casino hub and the biggest land crossing between the two countries. The bombings, come as renewed border clashes, show no sign of abating. Cambodia's defence minister said Thai forces dropped two bombs while the Thai side said that they had targeted a facility storing rocket systems.
