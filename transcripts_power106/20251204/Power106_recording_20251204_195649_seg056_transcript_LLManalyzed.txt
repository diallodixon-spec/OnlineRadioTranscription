curse of three hundred and fifty thousand U.S. dollars. All right, more about that tomorrow. Music of the day, I thought we had great songs. Boney M. gave us Mary's Boy Child. The only math it is, when the child is born, I'm going to be leaving you shortly with something very special, but just to tell you very quickly, that Pope is on Monday, so Friday, it's only on the station for one or six of them, the desert sound, where all those can and indeed contain. All right, have you ever heard Christmas carols Do Wap style? Do you know what Do Wap is? Music of the 50s when there was boys in New York and all the big cities used to stand on the corner and entertain. Well, The Dictors is one of the greatest, no question about it, that group. And here they are with an incredibly special, well arranged as far as the vocals go as far as I know, Guy McFatter and the others. Merry Christmas!
