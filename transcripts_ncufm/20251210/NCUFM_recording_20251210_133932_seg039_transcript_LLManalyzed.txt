============================================================

They've been trying so hard waiting there Waiting there for me and you Sometimes, rains are gonna come. Clouds will gather on the horizon. Blue will fade from the sky above. Sometimes, plans will be disrupted. Life will take a a turn hope will seem less than wishful thinking sometimes bad news will arrive and we will weep and we will wonder sometimes we'll get angry we'll shout with the question
