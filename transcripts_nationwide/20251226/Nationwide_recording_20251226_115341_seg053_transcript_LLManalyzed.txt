20251226 115341 Shining, shining, I know it's coming The way it burns, it's so hot It's so sunny, I guess I'm on a good day It's time to take off my shoes It's all over my face You make our hearts beat faster You make our hearts and cold Let it all come, let it all flow Let it all come Let the rest of the world stand Let it all happen in a minute Cause we're all in a hurry So we're in a hurry
