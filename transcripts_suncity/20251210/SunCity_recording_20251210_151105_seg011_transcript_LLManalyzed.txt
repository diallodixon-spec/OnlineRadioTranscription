============================================================

So all I ask of you is please stand tall. Stand tall. Remember me tell you, don't run before you can walk. As a friend and company, you have to watch them, you know. Show me a friend and I'll tell you who you are. Oh, my son, please be careful. And don't make me cry. I don't want to hold back anything or wipe the tears from my eyes.
