2025-12-11 17:57:40 could have occurred when the very reason we we sent our child to that school was because we thought that at the private school she would have been secured and taken care of by those persons who we trusted her with. You describe the man as a total stranger so you do not know him, your daughter does not know this individual. Does the school have any identity as to who this gentleman is? I don't know if the school has any idea who this person is because at one point what the guard said was that he had seen the person before and so we were even thinking that perhaps it was maybe like another parent. We were wondering if it's perhaps somebody who's accustomed to picking up a child and ended up going with the wrong child. Did Anka say whether he spoke to her during the time he had her?
