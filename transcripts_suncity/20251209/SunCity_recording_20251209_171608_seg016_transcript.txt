It's the most beautiful time of the year Lights fill the streets, spend so much time I should be playing in the winter snow I would be under the mistletoe I don't want to miss out on the holiday But I can't stop staring at your face I should be playing in the winter snow I'ma be under the mistletoe, yeah Shawty with you Shawty with you Under the mistletoe Shawty with you Sun City!
