20251224 112322 my advice from here out from a distance yes i couldn't do it from a distance if i was home you'd have to listen to me because my daughter here always say tell her friends here that my parents is jamaican parents and she don't play she don't play yes and when i get here when my daughter grow up i said to my daughter look because here they call the police if these kids when they don't when they want when they don't want you to reprimand them they call the police but I told my daughter whenever if you call the police if I slap you if I do anything as long as I don't abuse you and you call the police when the police come you will have to go with the police yeah treatin the picnic she knows that you have a Jamaican parents so don't play so don't play do so how is the boy doing now um please he is still not doing good but she's right he's still not doing good yeah
