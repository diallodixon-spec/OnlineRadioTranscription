20251229 190003 Thank you so much for staying with us. We return to you after this break. And remember our WhatsApp line, job creation is delivering real results. We are building Jamaica. The time by the office of the prime minister is 7pm. You know it's a joke thing every time you don't use your t-tag. I mean, with your t-tag, your 10th trip every week is free. And for every trip after that for the same week, it's 10% off. So yeah, wait, man. Get your t-tag today and drive like the winner you are every time. This Christmas, Scotiabank wants to make your holiday plans a little easier with the Scotiabank Plan Loan.
