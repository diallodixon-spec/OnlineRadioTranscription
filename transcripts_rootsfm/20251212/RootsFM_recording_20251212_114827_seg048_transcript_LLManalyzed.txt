20251212 114827 Your Christmas is a bit white Well, I am dreaming of a white Christmas Just like the ones I used to know Where the tree tops glisten and cheer in the sun To hear sleigh bells in the snow Well, I am dreaming of a white Christmas With every Christmas card I write May your days, may your days, May your days be merry and bright And may all your Christmases be white I'm dreaming right now
