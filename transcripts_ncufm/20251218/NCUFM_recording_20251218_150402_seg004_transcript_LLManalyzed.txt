It's it's it's basically urine, UTIs are typically diagnosed with just a urine test and doctors often prescribe just a broad spectrum antibiotic. So sometimes it works for the patient. Sometimes it doesn't. They don't know until they actually have tried it. But with this now, this test, well, they said that they usually did only for high risk patients and it takes two to three days. But with this new method of testing it, it reduces how long it takes by a day. And then based on what antibiotic responded to the bacteria in the urine, then they can just prescribe that specific antibiotic to the patient so they're seeing best results and best treatments for their specific UTI.
