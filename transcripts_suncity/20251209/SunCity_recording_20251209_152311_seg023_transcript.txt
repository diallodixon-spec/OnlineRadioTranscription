This is a beautiful voice of sugar song. Song is called One People, which is what we are. Hey, one people, one country, one race Spreading love everywhere we go Nothing to me like New York People are flying for their niceness On the riverside, tropical bliss I love all the kids that I play I wish we could all be like children
