Finally, in local news. As Jamaica marks International Human Rights Day, the opposition is reminding the government that constitutional rights must not be sidelined during the recovery from Hurricane Melissa. The opposition spokesperson on human rights says the devastation across parishes from Westmoreland to Portland underscores that disasters do not suspend citizens' rights to shelter, clean water, health care, and timely relief. Calling for transparency and equal treatment, the spokesperson urged the government to accelerate aid, restore critical infrastructure, and ensure no community is left behind. They also stressed that the right to life remains paramount, noting that police killings cannot be a path to national stability. That's it for our local news. Up next is regional news.
