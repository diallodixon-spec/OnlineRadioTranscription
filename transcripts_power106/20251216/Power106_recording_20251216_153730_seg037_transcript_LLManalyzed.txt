20251216 153730 and also the Chairman for Villas and Apartments with the Jamaica Hotel and Tourist Association, the JHTA. Good afternoon, Vanna Taylor, and welcome once again to Power 106 FM. Oh, thank you. Good afternoon, everybody, and thank you for having me. A pleasure to have you online. I think it's the first time you'd be joining us on both sides of the story after Melissa's passage. Certainly, certainly. You can give us an overview of the damage to areas that you administer at the JHTA, especially in Ocho Rios, when there may be other passengers. Okay, Ocho Rios when there may be a chapter in 2010 near Portland, we want to say, you know, thank God that our lives are spared, first of all, and we want to, you know, we're so sorry for those persons who have lost their lives and also have lost various material goods and, you know, and are still reeling from the start. We all are, we all are, but we still have to thank God.
