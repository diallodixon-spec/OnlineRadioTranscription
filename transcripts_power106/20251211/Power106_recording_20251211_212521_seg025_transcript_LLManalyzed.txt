May I build a concrete house? And we say, if you want to see how much of them are fighting me for, you know, I sometimes, when you see me set up at night, I fear if anybody are licking down them, they can call the police. They can't sleep straight through the night. So people wicked and bad-minded to a brother and sister. And the Bible tell you about the Israelite. God said hopefully fire, fire, hopefully water, water, hopefully death, death. But he now wants it somehow. All right, now hold on.
