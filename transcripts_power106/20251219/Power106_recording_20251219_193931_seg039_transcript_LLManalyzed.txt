20251219 193931 Number 10, Bosie Girl. Nice name for a horse. Hasn't proved to be all that Bosie just yet. Shaim Gordon, another one that takes showing some promise in the Saddle, will ride. And I think Bosie Girl may be the obvious threat to the winning aspirations of number 6, Sweet Byrne. All right, the old friends of you playing the exotics, look at number 2, Lady Kath Mara. Look at number 5, Girlie the Butcher. Nice names here. But please, for me, it's number six, Sweet Byrne. Over, number 10, Bo Sigurd. There's an interesting entry in here. Belisa Grease, all right? She will be written by Jerome Innis and has been seen at exercise fairly often. Now, this is sort of her. First day she ran, she finished 11th, behind Lucy on the goal, who was a winner again since. And so this feeling, people got some improvement, and I think we'll be fancied in the betting. Mr. Darryl Granberry, he needs to be the rider.
