Baby, don't look back. We won't look back, baby. Don't look back. The person behind you, there's nothing to hide. If your first lovers broke your heart, there's something that can be done. You can't run, you can't hide, you can't run Cause if your baby's gone Because of what he's done You can't run So if you just put your hand in mine We're gonna leave all our troubles behind We're gonna walk and don't look back Don't look back, don't look back baby We won't look back, no baby
