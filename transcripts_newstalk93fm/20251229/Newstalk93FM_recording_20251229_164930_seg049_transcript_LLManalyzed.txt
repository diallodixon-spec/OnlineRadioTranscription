20251229 164930 I was your father figure We drank that brown liquor You made a deal with this devil Turns out my dick's bigger You wanna fight, you found it I got the place around it You'll be sleeping with the fishes Before you know you're drowning Who's portrait's on the panel? Who colored up your scandals? Mistake my kindness for weakness And find your card canceled I was your father figure You pulled the wrong trigger This empire belongs to me Leave it on me I protect the family Leave it on me
