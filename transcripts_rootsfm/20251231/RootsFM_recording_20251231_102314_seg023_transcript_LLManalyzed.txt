20251231 102314 Jaga provide you know and so I just say that this brother here Donald Oliver is her true inspiration and should be a true inspiration to us all I am truly inspired by him I'm gonna do some more research on him and his work in sport and Just as a human being and the work he did just before he transitioned For persons down in Westmoreland in terms of helping them to recover road to to recovery, I think, it's what it's called. So, you know, walk good, my brother, walk good. Fly away home, fly away home. Know your work has just begun as an ancestor, because we are learning now. That's the thing about ancestry and legacy, you know. Those who didn't really know him well, didn't know all the details of what he was doing, those who knew him well and knew how excellent he was, it takes us to another level of how it is that you love what you do and we in turn love him because he loved what he did and he presented well. So I'm going to say what good brother, what good Donald Oliver.
