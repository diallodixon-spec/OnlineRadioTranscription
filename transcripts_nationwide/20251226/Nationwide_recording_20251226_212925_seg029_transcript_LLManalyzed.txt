20251226 212925 I'm always gone when you're beside me. I have always needed you. Could never make it home. I am a man who will fight for your love I'll be the hero you've been dreaming of We'll live forever knowing together That we did it all for the glory of love It's like a night in shining armor From a long time ago Just in time I must save the day
