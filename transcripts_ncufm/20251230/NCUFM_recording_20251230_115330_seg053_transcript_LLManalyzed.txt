20251230 115330 Dear Heavenly Father, thank you so much for another day. Father, looking back at how far you've taken us, we are so grateful. Looking at the difficulties that have made our characters grow, that have made us stronger. Looking at the wonderful moments that made us smile and really see how much you love us. Looking at the times when we even may have questioned whether you were there or not. All of these moments came together to make us stronger in you, to make us see you in a better light, to make us appreciate your sacrifice and your love. Thank you so much Father, we appreciate it so much and we can smile even in the difficult moments, even in the times when we don't understand, we can smile
