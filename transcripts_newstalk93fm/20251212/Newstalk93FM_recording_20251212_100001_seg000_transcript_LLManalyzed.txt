20251212 100001 I hope you're good, I hope you're well, I hope you live. I miss your touch, I miss your smell, I miss your lips. You can grab a drink, maybe grab some food, don't be shy. I know it's hard, but don't act like one. I have to protect my heart. I built the wall so tall, I couldn't look over. I need to touch you, I need to touch you One more time I need to see you I need to tell you I'll take you one by five Not on the wireless And though you said not to call you, you don't miss you And I hope I can see you one more day when I'll miss you. Baby, baby, baby, baby. Ring, ring, ring, ring. Pick up the phone. Hello? Ring, ring. Ring, ring.
