That's a wrap. A review of the top stories of the week, Sundays at 12.15 p.m. hosted by Earl Moxham. For fast-paced and insightful analysis of the news, there's just one place to go on Sundays. That's a wrap. 12.15 p.m. on Radio Jamaica 94 FM. Amarul Moksha, and indeed, that's a wrap. You're you on Beyond the Headlines. I'm Dionne Jaxmillo and the Office of Utilities Regulators.
