============================================================

Love is patient, love is kind Love is humble all of the time Not easily angered, enduring the death So never forget, love is the way But if I don't have I don't have love, I don't have anything I could give to the poor, everything I own But a heart without love is just a heart of stone Love is patient, love is kind
