20251230 154724 Every race and every generation unified We will rise up hand in hand Together we'll stand as one So thankful we've overcome The dawning of a brand new day In unison we'll lift up our praise Nobody will cry anymore No one will hurt like before Nobody will say goodbye No tears to fill our eyes No one will do without No curse, no fear, no doubt Won't you take my hand And go with me to the promised land? Nobody will die anymore No one will hurt like before Nobody will say goodbye No tears to fill our eyes
