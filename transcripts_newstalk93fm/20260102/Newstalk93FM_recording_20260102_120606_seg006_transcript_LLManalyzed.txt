20260102 120606 When I'm feeling under the weather You just make me feel sweet Ice the cocoa tea, use the sugar And together we are complete, darling Heat me up Only you alone can put fire back in the soul heat me up and they telling me I should lead a fire Well, the you again All day, through the night, I'm dreaming Miss Houssiné When you turn the top, make it smooth, my darling When outside is pouring rain Put a button on the fire Bubbling, you're bubbling, you're bubbling me too
