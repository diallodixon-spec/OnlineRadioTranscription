We follow the truck when we touch the road Nuts for the road, touch a fall like a road All when we buy beef patty, yams and galash beef patty Right rung by half a tree road Just like in Trinidad on the road So can we pleasure me mother on the road Today we come to new road. Where the roundabout link with a few road. On the new road, new road. Where me candlestone, yeah we do road. All on the old road, lane on the New Road. Where the Roundabout link with the few road. On them, carnivals on the sleeping tonight. Tell them how go run and sleep in a new bag. Fresh in me new garments and me new clothes.
