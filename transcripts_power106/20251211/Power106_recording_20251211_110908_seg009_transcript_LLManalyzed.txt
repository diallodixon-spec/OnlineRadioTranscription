Alright, let's get back to really what is dominating our discussion. So only structures that have been formally assessed by the Ministry of Labour and Social Security will be eligible to receive a government grant for roof repairs and other reconstruction support. The government says the measure is intended to ensure fairness, accountability and the proper targeting of limited public resources to households most in need. I don't have no problem with that. The problem I have is the speed at which we're going. We are 42 days after the passage of Hurricane Melissa. We really need something that's not happening. And this issue with the S Hotel kind of highlights it for me. We told that the containers will arrive when? Sometime in February. And then they have to be fitted out and customized. So that's one issue.
