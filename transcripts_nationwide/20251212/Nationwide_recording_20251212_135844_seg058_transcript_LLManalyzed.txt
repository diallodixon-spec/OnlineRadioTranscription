2025-12-12 14:31:04 3-4,000 people passing through here since morning. I was actually saying to somebody, I think, certainly for the locations I've been at, the stops I've been at the crowd here is the largest I've seen. Certainly the ones I've been at. I might have had another opportunity in Trelawny. Yes, Trelawny was also quite big. But I want to say thanks to our sponsors. For example, the Kemlani group. Absolutely. The mattresses. We like hot bread. Yes. And we could do with another two thousand. Yes. Yeah. Uh people need roofing material. Yes. Yeah? So I want to say to the corporate sponsors, yeah, thank you all so much yeah because people appreciate it yeah and one of the hardest things for me so far cliff is when they come you know because people hear that we're here and they come and then we have to say it's all done yeah because there was an early morning rush soon as we got here at nine o'clock and so
