20260101 200403 individual, political party, corporation, or other institution. National development is a shared mission that calls upon the strength and creativity of each of us. As we enter 2026, let us all live with purpose and kindness in the spirit of national unity. Let us always look out for our neighbor, support local businesses and industries, and be generous to those most affected by the impact of the hurricane. Let us carry forward the lessons of 2025 and always be guided by the truth that we are stronger when we support one another. On behalf of the entire opposition, I extend warm New Year's greetings to you all. May 2026 be a year of healing, renewal, and collective progress. Walk good, stay hopeful, and may God bless Jamaica Land We Love.
