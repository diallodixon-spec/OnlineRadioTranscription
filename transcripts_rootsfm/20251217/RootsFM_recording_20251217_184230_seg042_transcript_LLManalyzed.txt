20251217 184230 What is Raynaud syndrome? What does it look like? Who is affected by this? But before I speak specifically to Raynaud syndrome, when we look at a syndrome, a syndrome really is a group of signs and symptoms that tend to occur together. It does not define the person. Importantly, these group of signs and symptoms do not define the individual, but they describe patterns that are happening in the body of the individual. So just to know that. So sometimes they say, oh, that boy with the Down syndrome, we should not really be labeling persons like that. It's an illness like any other illness and so the labeling, the stigma, the marginalization, we're asking that we reduce that when we think about those persons or we call them the deaf boy or the dumb boy or the, those terminologies.
