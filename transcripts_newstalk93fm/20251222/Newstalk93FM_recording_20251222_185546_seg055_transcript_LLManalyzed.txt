20251222 185546 My mind wouldn't leave me I tried to get by but I'm burning And behind my mind it runs All these thoughts of troubling Fighting to give up my pain Fighting to be on my lane My mind running to the other side When it's time to leave my life Then it tries buy send me piece that you cannot buy. Send me love that you cannot mix. One is the joy that you cannot waste. And the other one price that you cannot fix. This is the piece you cannot buy. Find it a way where you cannot see.
