20251223 114326 NCUFM. I look in the mirror and every part of my body was in place Many people died and never saw this day So another day I live I appreciate Don't ever wanna act too high and mighty Cause tomorrow I can fall down on my face So in every single Lord I give you praise And that puts a smile on my face Lord I thank you for sunshine Thank you for rain Thank you for joy Thank you for pain It's a beautiful day Beautiful day Beautiful day
