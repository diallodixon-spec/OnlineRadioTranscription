You bring a vibe with your hands them up in the sky rolling back and having a time Yes, we jamming down to the end see me with my carnival friend How she come from me London how she come from me New York how she come from there When you come in my baby, how she come wish you'd come from there. When you come in, my baby. I wish you come from there. Atlanta, she come from there. Toronto, she comes from there. And I know that you miss me. I love the way that you bring a pie. With your hands them up in the sky. Falling down and up in a time. Wine in season again.
