20251218 161816 women, we're amazing, we're excellent at taking care of everybody else and everything else but ourselves. And so at this point, it's a time to really pivot and really start paying some attention to yourself. I agree wholeheartedly because it's so true that women in their thirties, late thirties going on may start experiencing some of these symptoms, but a lot of them ignore it. And why do you think it's so? Well, it's not just them, a lot of their physicians. So they go to the primary care doctor and they're telling the doctors that, you know, I'm experiencing this. And do you think I'm in perimenopause? I've heard this so many times. And the doctor's like, no, you're too young. And that is because we were not educated in medical school on this subject matter. Yeah. So a lot of women are dismissed and they go on just, you know, you notice you start getting the midsection bulge. Yes. And you're like, I'm exercising. I'm not eating anymore. What's going on? Because again, estrogen controls the fat.
