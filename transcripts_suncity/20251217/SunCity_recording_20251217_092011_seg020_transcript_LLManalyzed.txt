20251217 092011 I've received what I needed. But we forget that there's a tomorrow. So what's happened here? Amos got the vision. Because to understand the vision, you have to go back to like verse one. In verse one, Amos eight, verse one, it says, does save the Lord God to me. So God speaks to him, behold a basket of summer fruit. So God is, and God says to him God says and he said Amos, what do you see? So so I so so I said a basket of some of fruit. Then the Lord said the end has come upon my people. I will not pass by them anymore. So what he's talking about is the judgment because all the other lands had people who were supposed to be looking to them for direction but they weren't following what God had said. So as far as God is concerned then the judgment is not only going to come on the people but it's going to come on Israel as well.
