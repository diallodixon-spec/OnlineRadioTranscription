20251215 120506 Father, in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, we put the community of Waterhouse before you. Unity drive, Father. And we put Sister Griffiths before you, right? Whatever she's going through right now, I decree and I declare Isaiah 54 and verse 17 over her life, no weapon, absolutely no weapon that farm against her shall not prosper. And in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, we lift up a righteous standard. Can I speak with authority? You are blessed and highly favored. Believe and it is possible. Matthew chapter 7 and verse 7, it says ask and it shall be given unto you seek and you shall find knock and it shall be opened unto you. So if you follow the word of the Bible where the word of the bible is taught, you will be blessed. So in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth.
