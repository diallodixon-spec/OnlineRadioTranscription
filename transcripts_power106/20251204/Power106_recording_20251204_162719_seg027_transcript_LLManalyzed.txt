Professor Hutton? I would suggest that utilizing the technology of YouTube is worthwhile. Myself, during some days to prepare, I go to YouTube and learn a lot from them. But that is enough to provide the skills, to provide the hands-on type of training, because that is what TVET is about, field training, at least part of that, because the mental part is also crucial. But of course, simulation is another approach. So while YouTube and other types of platforms are useful, at least for now, we have to do the actual activities. And that's why apprenticeship, for example, is being emphasized.
