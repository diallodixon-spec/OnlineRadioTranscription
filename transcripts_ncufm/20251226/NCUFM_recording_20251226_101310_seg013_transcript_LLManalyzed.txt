20251226 101310 Girl, how do you know about customs? You don't want to stop listening to hearsay? You ever experience that? Customs don't go in your package, suitcase, barrel or cargo unless you ship the item or the agent stand up right there when they inspect it. Listen, customs job is to protect the borders, collect revenue and to facilitate trade. They don't collect or store shipment, they inspect it and somebody off-represent it for inspection. Eh, so how customs ever get so much custom then? Tracy, and the customs alone involved in the clearance process, you know, even though it's them we tend to talk about. Look at it this way, shipment delayed, talk to your airline agent.
