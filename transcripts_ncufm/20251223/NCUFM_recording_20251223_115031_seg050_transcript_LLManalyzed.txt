20251223 115031 It seems like much for us to offer up But bring it to Him anyway He loves it when we trust A broken prayer is still a prayer We know the Lord will be right there when we cry A fragile phrase is still a praise It will be heard when it is raised to the sky We don't need words of eloquence when we talk to Him, cause the Savior is concerned with every kid. He hears a broken prayer. A broken prayer is still a prayer.
