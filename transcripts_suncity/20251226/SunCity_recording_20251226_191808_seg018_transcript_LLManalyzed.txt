20251226 191808 Come too far from where I started from. Nobody told me the road would be easy. And I don't believe he's brought me this far to leave me. No, you didn't bring me out here to leave me. No, you didn't break me. I'll never leave you lonely. Even when I can't be with me. I know that you were with me, so I can't. I just can't, no, no, no. Cause I've come too far from where I started from. Nobody told me, nobody told me.
