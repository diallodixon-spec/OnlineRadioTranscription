20260102 145032 Hold on, hold on. Leave me on red, babe, but I still get the message. Instead of lines, three dots, but I can connect them. And if it ain't rape, babe, you know I respect it. But if you need time, just take your time. Honey, I get it, I get it. I get it. The way you got me all in my head. I think I'd rather you in my bed. Whatever it is, you know I can take it. Counting the days, how many days, till I can see you again.ing kisses like will you catch up my night? I'm cute but with arrows babe, I'm just shooting my shot. If I could get in, drive me a pen, hop in the **** and come over. Don't wanna be friends, just in the skin.
