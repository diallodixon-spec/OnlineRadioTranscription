20251223 143427 all right here we go I love the way you look, I love the way how you walk on I love the food you cook, I love the clothes that you have on Yeah, me love the way you treat me, safe in a stand While you alone can make me feel better Oh, oh, oh, I never feel like this from a van But now I see the right thing clearly on the wall You want me at the right thing, clearly over All loving, running over like Niagara Falls You're my favorite
