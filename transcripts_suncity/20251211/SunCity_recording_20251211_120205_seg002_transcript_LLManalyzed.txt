Good afternoon and welcome to the midday news on air and online at www.suncityradio.fm. I'm Jodi-Ann Beckford. Coming up in our headlines, excuse me, in local news, government spends over $225 million on food relief, JPS, NWC to waive charges for customers still without service, and the House approves amendments to expand access to criminal record expungement. In regional Guyana, U.S. agreed to deepen joint military cooperation. And in international, broader clashes between Thailand and Cambodia intensify. And in sports, Kemps, Hillsden, Cornwall College 3-1. And in entertainment, excitement bails for I Love Jamaica benefit concert. Those were the headlines, but do stay with us for the news in detail.
