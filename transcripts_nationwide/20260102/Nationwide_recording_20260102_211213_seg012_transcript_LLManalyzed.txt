20260102 211213 quarter 3 2022 7.4 percent quarter 3 2023 2.3 percent quarter 3 2024 it contracted by 3.2 percent and quarter 3 2025 it expanded by 5.1 percent i guess where i want you to to to analyze it from keenon similar to what donovan did is to those who will just dismiss the numbers as pure recovery and not a signal of the resilience of the economy or even the economy's, the economy's well-being, they would, that kind of reasoning would make it seem as if, oh, nothing had to be done for the 5.1% to be achieved. The 5.1% is a matter of course given the damage caused by burial and I just wanted to reason along those lines. Is 5.1% a matter of course, given where we are coming from post burial? So it does exhibit resilience.
