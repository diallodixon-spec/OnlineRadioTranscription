20260102 102018 That's why they revised it, but they revised it. They revised it, yeah, right. I am not totally convinced about the 5.1% growth, because I also have to look at where the expenses are, even locally, where the fees get. In August it's 1.2, in September 2.1, October 2.9, and a high of 4.4 in November. So it does not match, it does not show where the improvement is. And that is what I am questioning now, how the numbers have given up so high when we do not see what has given the growth of this type of movement. And this is what I'm not understanding, because we're still having the instability in the economy. We do not see the investor confidence either.
