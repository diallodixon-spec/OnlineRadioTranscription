============================================================

the hurricane had a heart attack and died. And these are the kinds of effects and the impact that we're seeing this tragedy having, you know, on people across the length and breadth of the island.

They have worked for at least you still have your life is not cutting it because they have lost everything they have lost everything and so the life alone does not get them to where they want to go it doesn't give them back everything that they want at this time yeah they need help they're people I mean I guess fortunately I was gonna say but fortunately, I'm in a position where I have access to particular individuals whose homes and lives have been destroyed and I have been talking to them, trying to get assistance for them.
