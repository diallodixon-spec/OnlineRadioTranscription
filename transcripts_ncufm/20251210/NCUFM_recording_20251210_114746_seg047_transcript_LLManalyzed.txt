Come rest your soul. Come in. The coast is clear. You don't even have to worry. Truth can carry us on our side. Love will left to fear? Confront your soul, what's here now? Don't even have to worry, the truth is on our side. What's left to fear. It's safe in here. The coast is clear. Let them wipe your tears.
