20251217 152519 If I'm not mistaken, I think Geisel is in one of those northern constituencies in St. Catherine. Yeah? Geisel almost borders southern parts of St. Anne, I believe. Right? So, yeah, at least I got that little part right. But definitely I miss Walker earlier. But in terms of which exactly which northern constituency is a guy's hill in. See if we can do the search on that. So guys, it is in the northeastern part of St. Catherine, bordering St. Mary and St. Anne.
