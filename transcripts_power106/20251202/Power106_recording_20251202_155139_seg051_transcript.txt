to the world, the Lord is come. Let earth receive the King. Let every heart prepare Him room, and heaven and nature sing. And heaven and nature sing, and heaven and, heaven and, nature sing. Oh, joy to the world. Joy to the world. Oh joy to the world, the savior reigns. Let men their songs employ. Let the songs employ. The fields and floods. Rocks, repeat the sounding joy. We repeat, we repeat the sounding joy, joy.
