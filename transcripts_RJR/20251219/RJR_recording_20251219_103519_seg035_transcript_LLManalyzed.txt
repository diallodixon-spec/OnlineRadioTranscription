20251219 103519 time. Challenging time but nevertheless I'm encouraged by the support that we have been getting and really want to pay tribute to the team who are in the field. So it's really about the season right now and how we manage the season. You've spoken about the team, the hard-working public servants who have continued to operate under extreme circumstances including those persons in the hospitals in Westmoreland and in St. Elizabeth. I'm particularly impressed by the staff at Black River Hospital. But I know that on the whole, the public sector health workers are really, really working hard. So kudos to the team. You know, I'm a pharma public servant myself, so I know how hard, in spite of the grand narrative, public servants actually do work. And I'm sure that you as a minister, especially at Christmas, I would want to endorse that. Yes, well, I tell you, Christmas is a particular period for us in terms of the challenges there.
