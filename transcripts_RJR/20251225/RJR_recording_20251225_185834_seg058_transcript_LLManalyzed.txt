20251225 185834 Nula, what are you trying to do to us? It isn't that we don't appreciate your generosity, but the six geese have not alone nearly murdered the callin' birds, but they laid their eggs on top of the vet's head from the pear tree, and his bill was sixty-eight pound in cash. My mother is munching sixty grains of valium a day and talking to herself in a most alarming way. You must keep your feelings for me in check, Govenor. If things go on this way, the mother and I will smell as bad as the living room carpet. Please lay off. It is not fair. Gov'net. Day 8. Nula! Who the hell do you think gave you the right to send eight hefty maids and milking here to eat us out of house and home? Their cattle is all over the front lawn and has trampled the hell out of the mother's rose beds.
