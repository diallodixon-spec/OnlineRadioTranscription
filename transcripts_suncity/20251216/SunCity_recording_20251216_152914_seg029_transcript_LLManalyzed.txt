20251216 152914 If life could have purchased nothing alive, I'd have spent every cent to buy back my friend life. I know you're gone, I feel the pain. The love remained that will never change. It makes me sad when I hear your name. Cut me up, you're not there again now. One thing I know, I'm not gonna hide my feelings. Got no, just the memories. All I'm living with, the memories. Just the memories, all I got is just the memories.
