============================================================

Where the trees bear fruit and grow Where I find refuge in my God It's a place of surrender under I look at God I see what I want to be He looks at me and sees his son Sees change, and then they pass No way to know how long they'll last I'd love to know the reason why But God knows Seasons change And then they pass, No way to know how long they'll last. I've loved another reason why, but God knows. Seasons change.
