20251219 134824 Baby come give me your love You got me like Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa Shawty come give me your Love, love, love, love I said it's my house, I said make all that smoke As me I wake up, no shit in my mind no more Then one day too, one day, two, one of the four colors. Now, so, me, I go long to make my name go up. As I start to detour, I feel no matter this. Baby, girl, if you need me, I don't call love again. Because you gave me the girl, so you pull my heart for pain. Baby, you down, calm down. You're the somebody who puts in my heart for lockdown, for lockdown, whole lockdown. You use me life and town.
