2025-12-12 14:30:39 Oh, here's an interesting question. And I don't have the answer, but it's an interesting question and it may well come sometime, maybe when they identify the numbers who have died, which is still at 45. So here's the question the person put. Simon, when was the day of mourning for the people who lost their lives in the hurricane? To my knowledge, we haven't had one. And I think that's an interesting question. I think implicit in the question is why haven't we had one? And the only thing I can think of is once the full assessment of the disasters happened and the full account of lives lost, maybe that's when it will happen. I can't answer any more than that because clearly I'm not in a position to do so.
