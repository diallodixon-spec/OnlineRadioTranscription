And Lord, we recognize that there are pockets in the other parishes where there are communities and homes that have been destroyed. O send the help, O Master. I want to send it speeded, O God of Heaven. That his suffering might indeed be alleviated. We look to your hands, O God of Heaven. You have been our God, Lord.

You provided for us, Lord, a nation and opportunities to grow and to have influence well beyond our borders. May you, Lord, in mercy turn and look on us
