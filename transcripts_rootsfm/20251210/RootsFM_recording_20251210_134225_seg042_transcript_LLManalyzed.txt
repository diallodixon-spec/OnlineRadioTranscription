With all the colors of this world And if the sun doesn't shine tomorrow Ain't gonna cry no more Cause I've got someone in my life now That I'm not worth living for So I just spend those precious moments naked Celebrating love, those lonely teardrops I don't have to cry no more Those restless nights, no, I don't really know them anymore. Those awful days, no, they don't really stress me anymore. Because you rescued me, my baby, with the strength of your love. Now my heart is like the ocean Open up so wide Close my eyes and I can feel it Touch me deep inside Now I'm gonna tell the world, the whole wide world About the greatest girl of all
