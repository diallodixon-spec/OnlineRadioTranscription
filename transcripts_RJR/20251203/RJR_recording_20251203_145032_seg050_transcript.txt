a number of different outreach initiatives and I have seen the children doing the most playing with the electrical wires. I saw a set of them riding a tank that had been thrown off the roof by the hurricane and I mean at least that was more benign than the electrical wires so we still have to be aware of the children you know we still have to watch them we still need to give them supervision because they can step on rusty nails, get caught by metals that are rusted and get tetanus or which causes lockjaw or the standing water that we're speaking about, they can get leptospirosis. And remember with all the rain that has happened, mosquitoes are out. I mean, we're feeling it. So dengue is a problem as well. Long pants, light colored clothing, mosquito repellent. Long pants light colored clothing mosquito repellent and if they are with the skin, you know, they always have scratches or bruises or whatever. Please do not let them go into this water. Yes, because you know, they're making themselves susceptible to other things.
