And when people said to you that any video you see, any picture you see, is just not the same when you see the militia's destruction in person. That's 100% true. So when you look at what the parish has gone through, when I saw that states had made it to the finals of the cup, I was like, yeah, man, that's nice of them, you know, especially with everything that had happened, what the parish went through, what many of the residents went through, the fact that ISSA had suspended both competitions for a few weeks after the hurricane and then said they decided to resume because of overwhelming support from all the stakeholders. So to see stats come out on top, just watching, I felt a little bit emotional. So I can only imagine what they went through. And as I said, we have with us a principal, Keith Wellington. The head coach is with us, Omar Wedderburn, captain of the football team.
