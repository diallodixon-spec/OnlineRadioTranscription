20251226 170501 We know that you have the intent to help. Keep people in your prayers, keep the maker in your prayers and just help if you can. Oh, like I said, that just gives me all the feels. And Asafo Powell joins us now, the Sub 10 King himself. Asafo, thank you so much. So very much appreciate you talking to us this evening. Yeah, no problem, man. Thank you for having me. So I know a lot of people saw what was happening and say, oh my gosh, you know, what can we do? the excitement all the time. You know, so I normally just help families, help people all the time. So this was just natural for me to reach out and to help people and my wife as well.
