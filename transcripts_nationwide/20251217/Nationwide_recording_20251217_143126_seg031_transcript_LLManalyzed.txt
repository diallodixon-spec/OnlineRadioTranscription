20251217 143126 are here. Commissioner, thank you for fostering the culture in the JCF. You're not only training your officers with technological and tactical capacity, but importantly, you're providing the empathy, the communication, and the community engagement that is so, so necessary for policing. Thank you so much. We in the Alaska Chin Foundation share your view of empowering communities. We see that as essential in fighting crime. And you understand that we cannot arrest our way to safety. We must build it community by community, street by street, home by home, child by child. Thank you, Commissioner, and to your team for all that you do. And to every officer being honored here today, I say
