Our sister Isis Miller. They will give you all the information and need to know to become a part of the must-must promotion and remember conditions apply. In the meantime, 5.30 to the final leg of the Roots Quiz and then at 5 o'clock I will be making way for the evening news. Yeah, we want to say more power to you wherever you are. In the meantime for those those who are having a birthday today, happy birthday greetings going on to you. Hope you live to see many, many more birthdays to come. In the meantime Sligoville. Hey, we say good afternoon to you over there in Sligoville, especially brother Glenn. Yeah, we're looking at Jamaica's first free village, Sligoville. Keep it locked. It's afternoon radio, old school style. Wicked and wild, well versatile. I'm on the job. Hey, it's a nine to five. I gotta make that money because mouth must be fed.
