20260101 171210 Oh I'm a dancing man, I can just dance. You know it's all right, it's OK. I look to see another day. A witness tried, a wonder spent. A theory of time's OK for me. Whether you're a mother or a wife, whether you're a mother, you're staying alive. Staying alive. Feel the city breaking and everybody shaking. And you're staying alive, alive, alive, stayin' alive Stayin' alive
