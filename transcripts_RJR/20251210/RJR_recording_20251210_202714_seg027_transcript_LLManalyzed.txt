============================================================

I never meant for it to last so long Even then I knew it was wrong to leave you on Then I saw you looking close so far Designed a close fight, count the blind You just blew my mind Have to try and make you understand I always had a lover on command But it's changing hands I know for sure that somewhere down the line What we had felt had arrived Now we're ready for something new You can plan your plans But not what you do Move out! Move out! I don't love you, boy I tried to run you away You nothing but a toy Move out! Move out! Say the game is on But oh, I got no more Whoa-oh-oh-oh! Move out! Move Out! Cause I don't your voice Fight to warm your voice
