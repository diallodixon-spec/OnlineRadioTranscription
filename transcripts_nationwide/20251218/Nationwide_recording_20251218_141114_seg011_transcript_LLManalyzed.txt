20251218 141114 in the night away. Born through a party in the county jail. The prison band was there and they began to wait. The band was jumping and the drums began to swing. You should have heard this knocked out jailbird sing. Let it rock. Everybody let it rock. Everybody in old Singapore was dancing to the jailhouse rock rock Spider Murphy played his intersaxophone Little Joe was blowin' on the slide trombone From above in Illinois we crashed boom bang The whole rhythm section was a purple gang like rock Everybody loves rock Everybody knows they'll rock Pushed down to the jailhouse rock Do you like good music? That sweet, snowy music Just come to this queen, yeah Oh, yeah, oh, yeah
