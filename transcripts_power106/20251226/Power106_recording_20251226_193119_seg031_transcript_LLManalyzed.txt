20251226 193119 I hear love loud and clear With your touch you tell me you'll never let go Open my eyes and beg you to take full control Baby in this moment I understand you without a sound Without a doubt So baby, close the door Turn the lights off, hold me like you never did before Closer than we've ever been With words unspoken I cry out to you when you answer me Silently in the silence of the night Your heartbeat speaks to my heart
