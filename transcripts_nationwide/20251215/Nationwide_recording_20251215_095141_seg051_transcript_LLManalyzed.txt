20251215 095141 now a citizen in Antigua, how do they go about getting a Canadian visa? Hi. Well, first step would be to apply online. So that's all applications for visitors visa study permit. Most applications now are submitted online. If your application is successful, then you'll be requested to submit your passport. At that point, it would either be through a visa application center, or if you're able to courier the passport directly to the High Commission. So you would probably need to double check that information after you've submitted. And once you receive the approval letter from Immigration Canada, they would have instructions in the letter on how to submit your passport. All right here is one for you Opal it says how soon after receiving your green card can an LPR apply for a US post visa?
