It's not a worse all persons weren't killed at the time and there's a Congress when in Congress will raise the issue whether or not this is a law but without it all can be considered a War crime. Okay, no We're talking about others are listening good. I'm so the question is because you remember know that the US does not agree to the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court. That's not a part of it. You see what I'm saying? But having said that, where the chair is concerned, the question of proximity, you have to make a sovereign decision to make, doesn't mean that every action that flows from what you have done means that you're culpable for that. So if you want, for instance, a place to land or to do what is necessary, that you deem necessary that is, to whatever the policy or the focus is, whether you are complicit, either could be a stretch. You understand?
