I didn't know how to believe I'm getting paid cause I'm still on stage I'm done hiding now I'm shining like I wanna be we dreaming hard we came so far now I believe we're going up up up it's our moment. You know together we're glowing. Gonna be, gonna be golden. Up, up, up with our voices. Don't want to get you so wounded. Gonna be gonna be golden. Done hiding, now I'm shining.
