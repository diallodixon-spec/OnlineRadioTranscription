20260101 184633 I don't understand me I really don't know the deal about love Trying hard to make it right Not long ago, before I realized Everybody's talking all this stuff about me Why don't they just let me live? Tell me why I don't need permission, made my own decisions That's my prerogative It's the way that I want to live I can do just what I feel Nobody can tell me what to do Cause what's my life. Cause what I'm doing, I'm doing you now. Don't get me wrong, I'm really not suit. Eagle Chase is not my thing. All these strange relationships really gets me down.
