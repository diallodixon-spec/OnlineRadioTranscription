20251219 113831 As a fitness guy, I was surprised by my chronic illness diagnosis. I thought working out hard I would fix it, but it wasn't enough. Now, my prescription meds are part of my routine. When I got my diagnosis, I really felt down and stopped spending time with the people I love. Then I decided not to let any disease get the best of me and I'm committed to taking my meds as prescribed. On time. Every time. No hesitation. Take your medication. A message from the NHF. NHF is here for health. NHF is here. Field hospitals in St. Elizabeth and Falmouth are now open, staffed by Jamaican and international professionals from surgery to maternal care.
