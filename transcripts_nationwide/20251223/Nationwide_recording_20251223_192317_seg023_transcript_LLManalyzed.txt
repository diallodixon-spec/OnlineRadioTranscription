20251223 192317 Yes, sorrel is my favourite. Thank you so much. It has the antioxidant properties. The leaf and the sorrel itself has anti-cancer properties. The sorrel that we drink has even more because of that anthocyanin component, that red component that's in it. And what it does, it helps to call it apoptosis. It's cause cancer cells to burst. Oh. Thus our body get rid of it, right? So it prevents it from growing and taking over organs and then system, et cetera. So drinking antioxidant drink or sorrel in this case, if you drink it over time, it helps to clean the body from cells that can be cancerous. Oh, the more you know. Yeah, growth within the body. Now, tell me something, the sorrel plant is a perennial one, right? I mean, it grows all year round.
