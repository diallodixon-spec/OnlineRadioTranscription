20260101 124118 Sitting at home, I do nothing all day. But think about you and hope that you're OK. Hoping we'll call before anyone gets home. I'll wait and just leave alone by the phone. How could something so right be so right? I wish we didn't have to keep our love out of sight Living two lives just ain't easy at all But we're gonna hang on in there for Secret love
