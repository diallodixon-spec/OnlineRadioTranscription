============================================================

Daylight come and we don't wanna go home We losing control Turn the lights low cause we about to get blown Let the sun set down, we won't go out out out The bird is down, to the flow out out out Day oh, he said day oh Daylight come and we don't wanna go home So hit me now, you can't catch me boy You never see that about 100 G for sure Don, boy. Because I rap with the best of show. 305 to the death of me. Creaming up my body, let the ocean have what's left of me. But for now, forget about that. Blow the whistle, baby, you're the referee. You put it down like New York City's death. I never sleep.
