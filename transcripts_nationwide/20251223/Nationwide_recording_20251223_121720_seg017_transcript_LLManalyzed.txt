This, it says, forms part of efforts to ensure that no eligible individual is left behind in the recovery process. JCPD is encouraging individuals affected by Hurricane Melissa, including those with disabilities and their families, to report directly to the Ministry. It says self-reporting is critical in ensuring that the Government compiles verified data and mobilises relief efficiently. Additionally, JCPD is advising individuals whose housing or infrastructure has been damaged that assistance may be accessed through existing government mechanisms where applicable. This includes the National Housing Trust, NHT, or eligible contributors who meet the relevant criteria.
