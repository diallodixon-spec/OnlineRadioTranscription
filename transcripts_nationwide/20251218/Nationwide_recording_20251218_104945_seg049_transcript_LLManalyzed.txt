20251218 104945 to introduce our next speaker. Let me also take the opportunity to welcome our friends online. We have a global audience as usual here and our friends from nationwide 90 FM. They're also here as well. So we say thank you so very much for joining and we know that in the comments section you all will be giving those virtual rounds of applause, especially when we get to the award section of our program. In the meantime, however, we continue with the greetings and I ask you to help me invite Deputy Commissioner of Police Mr Warren Clark to come forward to extend his own greetings. Please put your hands together. Good morning, everyone. Thank you, Mr. Javan Keys. The Honorable Juliet
