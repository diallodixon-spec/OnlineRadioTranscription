20251226 112519 Music and we love us a little bit shy Just a taste of it and we'll be gone And nobody has a care for the music in the end It's nothing like I've ever seen before People dancing all night long Won't you say we got the time for the golden? I'm ready or not, it's only up to see Everybody's dancing, and everybody's on the beat Are you ready, or not it's where we're supposed to be Everybody's dancing and everybody's on a beat What you say, you and I should go together What you say, forget once you see But you say, don't you come along with me
