20251231 184539 evening rather listeners and viewers it is 642 and it is now time for the nation's business I'm Siobhan Campbell and I'm Tyrone Reid. Well stiffer penalties are on the horizon for those who engage in prairie larceny. Agriculture Minister Floyd Green brought the prairie larceney amendment bill through all its stages in the House of Representatives on Tuesday. The bill passed in the lower house with no amendments. The minister says several administrations have promised changes to ease the challenge theft poses for farmers. It's an absolutely significant problem for farmers. However, he says it's the Andrew Hollis led government which has made this a reality. Minister Green says the additional penalties will join those already increased by the government through the Agricultural Produce Amendment Act and he joins us now to discuss further. Good evening Minister Green.
