20260101 104627 My boy, are you up? You made my heart go giddy-up You are a sweet dance candy You're my sugar dandy Wacko, my boy, Lord Pup You'll never, never leave me Because it would grieve me My heart told me so I love you, I love you I love you so But I don't want you to know I need you, I need you I need you so
