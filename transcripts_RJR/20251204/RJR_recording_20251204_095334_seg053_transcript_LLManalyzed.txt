I just want to know if they can work in Jamaica. Right. That's an interesting question. Normally you have to be, you have to be called, registered on the role of attorneys licensed to practice in this country to go appear in cases. So some sort of procedural thing I think would have to be done before that can happen. So for example, if I practice in OECS, if I want to do some work in St. Kittsor, wherever, I'll need to be called to that bar there to practice. The same way I couldn't just get up and go to America to go take up cases there. I'd need to jump over some procedural administrative hurdles first, including the fact that I may not even know the law there because it's not my jurisdiction.
