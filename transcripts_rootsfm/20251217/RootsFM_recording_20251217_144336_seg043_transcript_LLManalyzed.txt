20251217 144336 I see you through the smoky air. Can't you feel the weight of my stare? You're so close but still a world away. What I'm dying to say is that I'm freezing for you. Touch me once and you'll know it's true. I never wanted anyone like this. It's all brand new. You're feeling it, my kid. I'm crazy for you Crazy for you Trying hard to control my heart I walk over to where you are
