20251218 092215 You're God and I'll be still and know You're all well and never runs dry No valley too deep, no mountain too high You are my strength and You are my guide Lord, You're in control So I'll be still and know you're aware That never runs dry No valley too deep, no mountain too high You are my strength, and you are guide. Lord, You're in control, so I'll be still and know, know You are done. You're right here with me.
