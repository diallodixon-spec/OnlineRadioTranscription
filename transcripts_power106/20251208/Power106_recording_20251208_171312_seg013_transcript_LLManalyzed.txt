not an issue of the top, but the situation that we have here in this community right now. We said in the recovery process, we've already been engaging with partners. We have our people from the communities who need their houses to be repaired and are willing to work to get these things done. So in harmony and in keeping with our community and the culture of how we operate, we had declined the offer of the military assistance on the ground, but accepted the offer of the materials and what other resources could be offered in getting the homes repaired. So in my mind it's a fair and reasonable ask and I think some of the pronouncements which were made were made ahead of me being able to consult with the council as well as the community. We had a tone-on meeting the night before. We communicated by letter to the Honourable Prime Minister of the outcome of the discussion with the council and the community, and it was all by consensus.
