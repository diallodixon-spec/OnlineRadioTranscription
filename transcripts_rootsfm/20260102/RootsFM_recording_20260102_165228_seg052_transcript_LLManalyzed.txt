20260102 165228 How could it be forbidden if it's love? Loving you girl it's marvelous And when you're around my knees get nervous For you I need a word that describes And the word I use is bona fide From the first time ever I saw your face In my heart I created a special place You're everything I dream of How could it be forbidden if it's love, girl, how could it be forbidden? The way I feel just can't remain hidden. Folks may talk, but I don't care. Because wherever you are, girl, I want to be there. Nothing comes too late.
