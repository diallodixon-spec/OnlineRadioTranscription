20251230 113929 Oh My lady, give me a piece of that chup-chup, darling. One piece of that Chup-Chup, darling. So long you've been saving it, nonstop you're like craving it, I want some of that choo-choo, darling. Treat this when it a-rollin', rollin', loop back when it a rollin', rollin'. Things nice when it a roll in, rollin', and I love how we feelin'.
