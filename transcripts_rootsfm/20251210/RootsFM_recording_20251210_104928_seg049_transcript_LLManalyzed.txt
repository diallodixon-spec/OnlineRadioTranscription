Let's begin, for I intend to see my children playing in the streets Watch them playing in the streets They never could've loved you, Jay, like I love you, Jay They never could've need you, like I need you, that's why I be staying I know I'm not naga left you for another land That's not my playin' And me say not my playin Try Even though the times get hard And the mindset's hard Now me can't left yard, me a try Even though the body dem a pile And the gun dem a aisle can't lift off a missile, me a try. Even though the times get rough now and life gets snuff out, dem things we a tough out, we try. No matter what a talk and no matter what a spark, yo boy, you're still on me heart. And I never been a shatter, but a seen a shatter, meet a mean a shatter.
