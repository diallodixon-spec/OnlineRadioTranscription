20260102 160909 Moving, moving, moving, moving I want to go to heaven and rest I'm tired of staying down here I'm tired of the troubles and trials I want to go to heaven and rest Well I know where I am going I know, I know Yes I know I know where I'm going I know Joy bells are ringing No one has said Happy children are singing Well I know where I am going I know We shall have a grand time
