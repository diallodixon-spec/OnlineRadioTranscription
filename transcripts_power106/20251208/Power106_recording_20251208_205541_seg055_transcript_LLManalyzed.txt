We didn't know that faith would lead our hearts astray. Some things just weren't meant to be. When love is a lie, you can't see the forest for the trees. Baby, we'll recover. Let's learn, let's learn. There's no one over for you. Did I love you too hard, baby? I want to know, did I love you too strong? Have I loved you, have I loved you too long? Where did we go wrong? I don't know, you got to tell me.
