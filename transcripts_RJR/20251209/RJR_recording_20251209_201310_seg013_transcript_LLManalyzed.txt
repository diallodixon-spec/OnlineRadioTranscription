Low pressure blood flow has to now travel against gravity. Remember, it's like a gravity feed, you know. So if the pressure is low, if that's no travel against gravity, it has to now go upstairs. It's not so easy to make it upstairs, you know, Mrs. G. And so what ends up happening in our veins, especially our larger veins, is that there are little envelopes inside the veins that prevent the blood from flowing backwards inside the veins and these are called valves. Now these valves are like, you know the non-return valves in the pipe? So if you have a pipe that is connected to a water supply that has low pressure, and occasionally the pressure may build up enough to get the water up to a certain level, but it has some non-return valves, then at least it will prevent any backflow of the water. And so when more water comes up, it may push it up some more, but it prevents
