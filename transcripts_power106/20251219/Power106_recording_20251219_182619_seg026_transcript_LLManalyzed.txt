20251219 182619 for many years and Sidney McLaughlin never only stepped into that class and produced something spectacular produced a time we've not seen for over 30 years and I think given the significance of all of that and just how everything unfolded and it's also a clash that the entire track and field world has been calling for. I think so many individuals were tired of seeing Sydney McLaughlin-Liveroni walk away from the field over 400 hurdles, and for her to take on the challenge and deliver in the way she did, for me, that is world athlete of the year performance. And yes, I acknowledge the world records, but I think because the precedent is there, and Sydney McLaughlin and Evroni would have felt that because there have been years when she set world records, in fact multiple world records, and did not win.
