20251230 181712 Thank you both so much very much appreciate you talking to us Simon Crosskill and Leighton Levy as we continue to just try to grapple with and come to terms with news of the death of our colleague Donald Oliver and let me leave you with this sign out this goodbye video that Donald had done on his social media page this was when Sportsmax closed down earlier this year and I remember watching it and I was saying at the time you know I was so sad when I heard Sportsmax close because all the fantastic work that Donald Leighton and all of you over there did. So let's just listen to Donald saying goodbye. I am so grateful. Really, I am. Not many get to live their dream at work.
