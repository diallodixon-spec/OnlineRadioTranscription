20251224 125833 I'll come over here And help me trim the tree I wanna wrap you up, baby they'll see You're the only present I need There's so much more Waiting for you in store On this precious day I can barely say There's no place that I'd rather be I know you want my everything, come a little closer God will send you down from heaven Let it snow, let it snow
