I can't stay mad at you You can run around, you can tell me lies But there's nothing I can do Even when I cry, I can stay mad at you I got mad at you last night You were holding another tight But when I remember all your charms I bounce right right back into your arms. You know for sure I won't be the one to fall in love with someone new. I love you till I die and I can't stay mad at you. I got mad at you last night when you were holding another type when I remember all your charms I bounce right back into your arms
