20251218 151308 and Saturday we will be in Trelawny with the Children's Street. I must really give credit to Dr. Joan Williamson who had partnered with the Jamaica 4-H Foundation and through that network and the synergy that has been formed, we are doing great things. As a matter of fact, she told me only yesterday that she is putting packages of seeds and small tools and is a very important part of the process. Come in Sonia Sims and come buy out the whole farmers market.
