20251219 204125 Come and see what you mean to all of me. You're a treasure in my eyes. The greatest pleasure in my life. Cause when you're living by the knee, honesty, hurry please. Home is where the heart should be. Pretty feathers in disguise. Not together we will rise. So don't you ever let me down again Cause I'm depending on you So you better come through this time Please hear my cry and if I ever Let you down my friend It was a misunderstanding So if I took you for granted Then I not promised from today I go drunk like I never drunk Wait like I never went wine Like I never went before Just to show you I sell it, I sell it And I need you back in my life You got people by the truck Emotions running high
