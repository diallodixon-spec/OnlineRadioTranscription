Happy 100 year anniversary of our dear comrade leader, the great Michael Manley. Simon, the Jamaican government has become a footstool and of neoliberal colonial imperial Monroe Doctrine ideology. JPS led up and down the rabbit hole. When will we recognize that all policies they create are designed to keep the poor countries down? The JLP is not working in the best interest of the human capital of Jamaica, but instead working with the capitalists to destroy the human capital. Isn't it a bit early to be drinking? Anyway, you go on to say the GLP has worked with the multinationals and big corporations and the taxpayer money to cut off assistance to the poor and elderly of Jamaica. Show me proof of that because I don't agree.
