20251223 175330 So it's now my pleasure to present to you Soulful Symphony. Soulful Symphony is a wonderful orchestra out of Baltimore, Maryland. You know, and it's headed up by the conductor and artistic director, my brother, Darren Atwater. That's right, give it up for him. It's my brother. Listen, it's a talented group of musicians and singers, and they display the gospel of Jesus Christ in such a diverse way. Because, you know, in our churches, our children pick up instruments and they learn them immediately, you know, by the power of the Holy Ghost and by being in a musical environment. Soulful Symphony opens up a door that allows us to see cultural exchange in music that will inspire the youngest of hearts and even bring joy to the eldest. So right now with an original song entitled Purple, I know that sounds funny, but he'll explain it later. I want you to appreciate the ministry, the music of conductor Darren Atwater and soulful singer.
