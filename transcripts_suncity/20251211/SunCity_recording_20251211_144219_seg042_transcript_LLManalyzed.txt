============================================================

I love your voice. You have led me through the fire. In darkest night. You are close like no other. I've known you as a father. I've know you as a friend. And I have lived in the goodness of God. It was all my life you have been faithful. Oh yes you have. And all my life, you have been so, so good. With every breath that I am able, I will sing of the goodness of God.
