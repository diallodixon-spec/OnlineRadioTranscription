20251226 165247 I made my home in yours You see I'd live for you And nothing can compare To what we share We're in a world of our own So much love is there See baby you're all my life To live without you I wouldn't try What would I be without you? Let me make this toast to you You're what I said I pranked you like a never ending holiday You're my forever special occasion You know what I celebrate You're like an ever-ending holiday
