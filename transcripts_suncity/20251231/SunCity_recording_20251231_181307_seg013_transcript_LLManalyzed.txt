20251231 181307 I just don't really love the Babylon planet. I try to fight against everyone every day. I don't want to fall out of the seat and boy, I need the children. They don't really gonna lead you astray. Still I'm putting up a resistance. Now I'm gonna work it out. You know I'm putting up resistance. I've got to work it out. It ain't no they poppin' and sayin' Some say that when the children never go astray All I got to do is rest up for my feelings Don't hear me deal big, I'm gonna kneel down on my knees and pray Sometimes the pressure make me feel like holler When every science has no way out We'll give my back to make an overtime daughter That just goes from man to man Still I work it I'm putting up some resistance, baby. We're still gonna work it out, you hear me? Putting up some resistance, can you hear me?
