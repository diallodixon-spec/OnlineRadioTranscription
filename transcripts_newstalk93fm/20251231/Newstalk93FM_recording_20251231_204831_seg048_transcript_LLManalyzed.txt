You did do me good to you Every day new story you Share just a waste my time Cause you don't become someone else Zip a lava from you You know they touch my body, yo It feels good to love somebody And somebody loves you back But it feels one sided now It feels one sided now You don't have to return about it Cause it's crystal glad now, now Guess it's bye to the good times I'll be gone by the sunrise I'll be better on my own I'll be better, on my own Nah, nah Nobody should call my phone Nobody should, call my phone Nah, nah This is my last heartbreak song This is my last, heartbreak song Nah, nah I'll be good on my own
