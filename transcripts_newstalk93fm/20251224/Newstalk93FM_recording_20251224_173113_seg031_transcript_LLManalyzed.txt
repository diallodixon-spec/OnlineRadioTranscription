20251224 173113 So we out on the road now It's Mars and Riddim and Sorka And I'm ready for the rum, ready, ready for the rum Ready, ready, for the rum Ready for the action, come! This sweating spirit of me feeling good I have a lightning spirit Early in the morning I hat it Me cooler ready, me ice done ready Me punching that's automatic I have a lightning jumbie A kind of energy inside me And it ready for the rum Ready ready for the rum, ready for rum, ready for the action. A spiritual encounter in my soul taking over. Telling me to start up the drinking and do away with good behavior. So let we go, let we go down the road. Let we go, it's action time. Let we go. It's back
