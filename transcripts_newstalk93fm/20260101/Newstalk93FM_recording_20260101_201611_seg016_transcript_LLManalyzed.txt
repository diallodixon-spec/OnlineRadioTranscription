20260101 201611 You take all the pressure off my mind. All the time. Patient and kind will not be going out my mind. Say from the problems, I don't worry, because I'm hard to find. I'm from the block, baby. It's you and I, baby. If the world turn against me, who I got, baby? I'll set you up, baby. I've been a flop, baby. I'm talking. I know it. Put my heart up, loving you around. Loving you around, huh? I'm plug the alarm now, show you on my card now. I don't need a rich to somebody that can make me feel safe. Yeah, look, I don't want a couple, but nobody ever made me feel safe like you.
