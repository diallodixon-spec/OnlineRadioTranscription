Quick question now, Ingrid, in terms of who can apply for the grant of administration. Who are those persons, and what is the order of priority for that application? Okay, indeed. So, in Testacy, the Civil Procedure Rules, Section 6818, provides for who can apply for letters of administration. So the spouse is the first applicant, the first person who can apply. The spouse has priority over the children and everybody else as a matter of fact, right? So the spouse, remember we established that that spouse would have proven relationship whether it's a person was married or they have got the order from the court. You must get the order from the courts if you are a single person in a common law relationship. So this post, once you get the order, you have priority over everybody else.
