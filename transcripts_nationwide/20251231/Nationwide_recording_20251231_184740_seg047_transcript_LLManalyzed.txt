20251231 184740 We already have about 243 people who will start training some time later this year. But what we want to ensure is that when they're out, that the penalties that they are treated with and the acts that they can address are all covered. So one of the amendments was to ensure that acts that were not around, that they know can treat with them and acts that they prayed a lot for, acts that speak to that or agricultural produce acts. Additionally, offenses like searching or refusing a search by a agricultural warden and that penalty was like a maximum of $40,000 is now moved to $1 million. Things like taking a warden's uniform or impersonating a warden, that penalty was like $20,000. That penalty has gone to $5 million. So what we're doing is strengthening the framework to act around agricultural crime.
