20251217 090607 We shall prevail and Jamaica shall prevail over Melissa and all other things negative That is going on. We shall prevail We shall prevail. Thank you Chevelle Franklin for that great reminder and amidst whatever you are going through this morning. You shall prevail We want you to know right here on Extraordinary Abilities that you were made to prevail over all of these things. Whatever adversities may come your way, you shall prevail. So please stand strong, stand firm, knowing that there is one creator over us all who calls the Sun to shine every morning no man can stop that and if it's raining on your parade this morning just remember as one songwriter says the Sun will come out
