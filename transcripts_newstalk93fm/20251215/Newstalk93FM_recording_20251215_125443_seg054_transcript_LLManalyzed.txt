Nothing could be more precise, baby Deep as the blue sea, your love's flowing into me And even though the waves are rough, this love is tough, just love me Deep as the blue, deep as the blue sea Love me really and truly And even though the storms like a fruit tree look in my eyes What do you see I see happiness me and you are kick it like Bruce Lee
