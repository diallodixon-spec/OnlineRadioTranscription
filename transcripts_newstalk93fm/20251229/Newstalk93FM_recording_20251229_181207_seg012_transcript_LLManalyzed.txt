20251229 181207 This is my apology Follow me Come and see What you mean to all of me You're a treasure in my eyes The greatest pleasure in my life Cause when you're living by the knee Honesty, hurry please Home is where the heart should be Pretty feathers in disguise Not together we will rise So don't you ever Let me down again Cause I'm depending on you, so you better come through this time Please hear my cry and if I ever let you down my friend
