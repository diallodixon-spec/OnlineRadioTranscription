I will be your father, baby, with your tiny hand in mine I will be your preacher, teacher, anything you have in mind I will be your Father, baby, I have had enough of that I will be the one who loves him till the end of time If you are the desert, I will see If you ever hunger, hunger for me Whatever you ask for, that's what I'll be So when you remember ones who have lied Who said they cared but then laughed as you cried You're the father
