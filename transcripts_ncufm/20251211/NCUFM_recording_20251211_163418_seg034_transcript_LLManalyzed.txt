2025-12-12 09:24:27 Job chapter 8 verse 32 we are taught then you will know the truth and the truth will set you free I love this verse it kind of underscores truth as liberating and a foundation of a spiritual and an ethical life these scriptures reveal that moral virtues are not only societal ideals but also spiritual imperatives. Practicing honesty, integrity and truth, it aligns human behaviour with God's will and it strengthens personal character. So what are some challenges with practising these virtues? Because clearly it's not something that is just easy so. Maybe we have personal temptations the fear of consequences you're saying okay if I tell the truth that I am the one who is guilty of this you fear the consequences maybe you're being dishonest for personal gain or maybe some peer pressure often
