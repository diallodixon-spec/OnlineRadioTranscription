20251229 183118 As we recover and rebuild after the hurricane, it's important to keep your medication safe and use them as prescribed. Here are some quick medication safety tips from the NHF. Use bottled or cooled boiled water when taking your meds. If they get wet or damaged, do not take them. Store them in a cool, dry space away from sunlight. If your medication needs refrigeration, talk to your pharmac-Tag on TransJam Highways. Our automated T-Tag lanes reduce the cost of managing cash at our toll plazas, and drivers of Class 1 and 2 vehicles who use the T-Tags pay a lower toll fare than those who use the manually operated tollbooms. They also get their 10th trip through any toll plaza free. The T-Tag makes it quicker, more cost-efficient, and safer for our customers. T-Tag packages are discounted.
