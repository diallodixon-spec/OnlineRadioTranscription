We need a team that can do the things that are necessary, get the agricultural sector up and running, closely integrate the tourism sector with the agricultural sector, the creative industries as Dr. Gordon was just saying. We need to reduce the cost of energy because those are the outflows. The outflows for the food and consumer import bill, the outflows for the importation of energy, the outflows of the importation of intermediate goods and raw materials. That's about four and a half billion dollars. So if we are going to reduce the foreign exchange outflows, we have to attack those those sectors those sectors will also create employment and have a big multiplier effect on the economy but we need people who are seeing those things in a surgical way and to deal with it and I do not believe that this team has the capacity to deal with those things.
