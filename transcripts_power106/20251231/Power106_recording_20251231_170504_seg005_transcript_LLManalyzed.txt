20251231 170504 Michael Lee Chin confirmed that he has begun a structured, time-bound review of repayment options under an agreement reached with bondholders. The review includes a 45-day period beginning December 31 to address the outstanding US$94 million in principal and interest. Mr. Lee Chin says options under consideration include full repayment of the bonds, settlement within the agreed frame, or the sale of his shareholding in NCB Financial Group. He says he's working closely with advisors and stakeholders to determine the most appropriate and sustainable course of action. He has described the process as an orderly framework aimed at maintaining constructive engagement with note holders while identifying a responsible solution that best serves all stakeholders and allows AIC Barbados to meet its obligations transparently. JCSD trustee services says a further update on the process is expected in the week of January 5.
