20251217 130807 See the sparkle in my eye Feel the thoughts that make me sigh Can't you see the light that's all aglow And the love that seems to flow From me to you When you walk into my life Precious love inside Feels my heart and my soul And I can't deny That I love you more and more. You are the very special one. You're the one. Hey.
