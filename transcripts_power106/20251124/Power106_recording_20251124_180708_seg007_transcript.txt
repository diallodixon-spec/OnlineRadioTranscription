============================================================

could give this answer, the one I am writing now. All right, so we're going to play three pieces of music in tribute to the great man today. Fantastic, nobody recognize artists, I was looking at what they are saying on the international media about the great man, and certainly everybody on the globe knows his music, no question about it. Intercontinental star it intercontinental star Dimitri and of course this one one of our favorites because it's one of the greatest songs ever recorded by Jamaican artists and remember this takes us back to 1972 Believe it or not and this one we absolutely loved it. In fact, we played it last week for the boys going from two or so. It was harder to come, harder to fall. But that didn't quite turn out that way anyway. You remember the great man and the moment that you were able to see him on stage. I'm afraid so. It's amazing.
