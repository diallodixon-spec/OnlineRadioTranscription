============================================================

So calm and low. So calm your mind, concede, and you shall achieve it. Don't make them stop here with their bad energy. They've got no love only, but they're my friends. They've got warmth for me, but child, make me fly away tonight. Like a million sparrows, take me away from the horrors, you know. Child, make me fly away. Fly. I can't take this no more. This is not what I hoped for, you know then you shall achieve it.
