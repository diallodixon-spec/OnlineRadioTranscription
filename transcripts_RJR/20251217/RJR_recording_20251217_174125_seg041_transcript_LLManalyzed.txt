20251217 174125 sexual offenses act, but so be it. I think law conveys a message, and the message that it conveys in making this an offense is that persons under 16 should not be involved in sexual activity. I mean, what message do we want to convey to our children? We protest teenage pregnancies, but yet we want to liberalize the system. If the diversion section of the Ministry of Justice is not functioning efficiently, then we need to fix that. And so, no, I really don't think the law ought to be changed because in doing so, you are sending a message that it is okay. It is okay.
