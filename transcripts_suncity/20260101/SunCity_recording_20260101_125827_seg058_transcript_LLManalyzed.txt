20260101 125827 There's no one here. Say your lines, but do you feel them? Do you mean what you say when there's no one around? Watching you, watching me One lonely star I've always been in love with you I guess you've always known it's true You took my love love for granted Why, oh why, the show is over Say goodbye, say goodbye
