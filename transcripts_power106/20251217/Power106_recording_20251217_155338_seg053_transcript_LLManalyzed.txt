20251217 155338 With life and water and my kids are bright and going to good school. I don't care And that's why I'm that's why I am we can't talk to nobody else That's why I'm advocating for the poor of other people right now Which is so unacceptable? Have no water after almost six weeks six weeks now almost three months going they have no water in the town of Manteca Bay. Why is that, Jesse? Tell me. Why we can't have backup generator, or should have backup generator? Are installing backup generator. By the way, these backup generator, they're not in red lock generator. These are probably 20K, 30K. Or we can use propane. Not the propane you have to put in your house by the way, we can put a propane tank and have the truck come by and pump the propane in those commercial tanks. And then people will know that you're not going to get water all 24 hours.
