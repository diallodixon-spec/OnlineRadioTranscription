============================================================

I want to see good people try. I can see the wickedness within the evil eyes. We ain't also make them stress out and love stress out. Why them terrorize the youth night and day so? Why make them love the SLR and AK so? Make them love kill and put gun on the youth and waste so? They plague them no cake of the life, them not no mercy. Them want to destroy life, nursery. Them site the earth plant and go earthy. Call it jokes and they not talk about this earthy. Read Herbalist, not dilute, no herb with it, earthy. Grow it high tall with the mountain seed and search it. I could have a million of brownies more than earthy. Babylon's bread, my farm's still not deserted. Earthy, lead the light. Burn those myths, lead the die. They don't want to see good people's strife. I can feel the wickedness within their evil eyes. Binging hearts on me, they're stacer. And love's chaser. Why them terrorize the youths at night and day, sir? Why make them love the SLR and AK, sir? Make them turn up like a sick lad. Now the youths, they're worse, sir. They've set the bush on fire.
