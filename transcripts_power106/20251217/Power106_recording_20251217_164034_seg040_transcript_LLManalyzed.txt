20251217 164034 sector what does this tell you that the government is working for the imperialist and colonial masters and how could the government make such a terrible decision we can't pay the minister of agriculture for importing foreign food or goods we must abolish the agriculture ministry because it's serving the interests of the foreign industry okay ah all right i'm getting to that one in just a moment but finishing up this thread It said the JLPT administration has sold out the entire fundamental infrastructure and the people of Jamaica and have sold this country back to the oppressors. There is no arm of the government left to stand up for the people. Now the people of Jamaica have to be brave to dismantle the evil empire.
