20260102 194037 Mr. Townsend, you need to be more restrained in the early stages and ensure that your amount doesn't pick up the beat and run away too fast, too far in front, and pay the consequences at the end. Now then, what is the threat here? Probably up threats here. Number seven battle agent has to be that. In for a tag of a million dollars, which I thought could have been a decent acquisition, went back home from the camp of Anthony Nunes. Roman will ride. This horse finished a length and a quarter behind Warsaw in a pretty competitive sprint event. And Battle Angel in that race carried 119 pounds. Warsaw carried 114. So to be just a length behind and a quarter behind, that was a very good one indeed. So a bad length will be the big threat of Matuso. And then the general, a sluggard that gets himself well behind in the early stages of his race but has a very good finishing speed.
