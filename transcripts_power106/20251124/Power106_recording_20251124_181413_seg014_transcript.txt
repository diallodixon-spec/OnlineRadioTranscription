That will be a wonderful day in Jamaica. Thank you to the people. You will relive today and get a joy after suffer so much for the Melissa. There you can. So Jamaica deserves to qualify today and give a beautiful night for all Jamaicans. Very good indeed. Thank you very much for that now. Yes, they are standing up already and I understand that it's sold out. So, maybe we go to support. We have to go to update here. So, there's been a conversation with Mr. Rene Simone, the man who took the make-up to the World Cup final in France in 1998. It was a tremendous effort on the part of the coach and of course I was around and we are going to our break here but when we come back we're going to be having this conversation with one of the world's top coaches.
