============================================================

Time now for a look at the weather here on Power 106 FM, the meteorological services reporting that a trough is across the island. Now the trough is expected to linger across the region for the next few days. This afternoon should be cloudy with widely scattered showers across sections of most parishes. Tonight should become fair. 32 degrees Celsius is the maximum temperature expected for Kingston today, while in Mantigua Bay the maximum temperature expected is 31 degrees Celsius. And for the next three days, look for partly cloudy skies in the mornings over eastern parishes, otherwise it should be sunny. In the afternoons, look for isolated showers over western parishes and hilly aerials. That's it for a look at the weather here on Power 106 FM.
