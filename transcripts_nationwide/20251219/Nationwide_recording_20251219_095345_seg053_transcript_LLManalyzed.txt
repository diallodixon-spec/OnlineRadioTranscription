20251219 095345 Jamaica is truly special. Our people are strong, resilient and full of love. A love that moves us to give. Now at Mothers, you can pay it forward. With just $300, you can donate a meal to someone in need. Because sometimes a warm meal is more than a belly full. It's hope, comfort and a reason to smile. So from now through Christmas, let's make a difference. One small act at a time. Paid for with Mothers. Good morning, good morning. You're back here inside the Consumer Hour on Nationwide 90FM. I am Noregay Banton.
