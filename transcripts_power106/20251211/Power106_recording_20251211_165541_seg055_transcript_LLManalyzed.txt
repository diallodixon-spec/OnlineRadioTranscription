So how can Metro blame it on the utterance of the Minister about the non-renewal of the contract for them securing the loans outside the country. JPS and its shareholders may very well be able to secure the loan outside but just choose the government so they can make the interest on the loan. It's a win-win for the people who need electricity restored and the government making a profit on the loan yeah because the government is a 20% stakeholder here they have 20% ownership of the JPS so they would make a return on that money that is true
