what has happened because of this hurricane. Because people who never spoke to each other, you know, you can have neighbors and you're living beside them for all five years and you don't have a conversation and yet this brings you all together. One gentleman was recounting how his father is a Christian, a pastor, and has a neighbor who was never set foot inside the church. But when the neighbor's roof went, where did he end up? In the pastor's house. And there were several other people who were sheltering there. And they were able to just have cheerful camaraderie. And that's such a wonderful thing. When people can come together despite their differences, because they have, they're working together for a common cause. Fab five now, Christmas breeze, a blow.
