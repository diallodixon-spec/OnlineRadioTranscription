If you want to take my kisses in the night, be it. Jump, jump for my love. Jump, I know my heart can make you happy. Jump in, you know it's ours, we'll build you up. Jump, if you want to take our kisses in the night be it, jump. Jump for my love. When you are next to me, oh, I come alive. Oh Oh, it feels all right. Oh, baby, you're gonna love me tonight. You're gonna love me, baby, tonight.
