20251215 095339 Yeah, but the thing is though, the thing is that there is in fact contingencies to allow for this. You see the Jamaica today, that is at the point where we have had the kind of the bonds that are put in place for catastrophes, where you have money set aside for external shocks, where because of where we are, we are able to get access to these resources prior to the truth not able to. So you have to look at the reference to us to where we are now and our abilities to do this. And it is somewhat new, because you still contribute a position to do this, but we are in a position to help ourselves eventually. You see what I'm saying? But I think in terms of the explanation, that in terms of breaking it down, it's not a question of flicking a switch and getting light and as against not having light. The economy depends on the energy, the productivity, every which way. So the longer it takes, the more we are losing. You see what I'm saying?
