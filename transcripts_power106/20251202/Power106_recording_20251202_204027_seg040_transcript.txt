Solid Waste Management Authority NSWMA toll free at 888-253-2652 or via WhatsApp at 876-448-3220. Thank you for listening. I'm Anjoui James-Zoyez. Proper garbage disposal and collection are essential to combat the spread of disease. Here's how you can make the process efficient. Separate spoiled food, tree cuttings, bulky items and electronic waste. Put your garbage outside your gate only when crews are near your area. Bag leaves separately. Don't burn debris and report hazardous spills or illegal dumping and blocked access. A message from the Jamaica Information Service.
