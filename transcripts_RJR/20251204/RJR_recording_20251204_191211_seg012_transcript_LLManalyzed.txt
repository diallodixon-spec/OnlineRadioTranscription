We're going to get a little extra homework. You understand? But you can fall in love with a subject. And one of the things I usually do too, I normally say to them, whatever question you get wrong, we're getting five more of this type. That means you didn't understand it. So I'm going to show you how to work it. So for everyone you get wrong on the homework, you're getting five more. These are nice as a gift, so make sure you bring them back to me in a lovely package. Yes. And how they react to that? And well, they weren't happy about that. I can imagine. When I'm collecting my gifts in the morning, they have to line up outside the classroom and I tell them I need your passport. You cannot board without your passport. So I said, passports, please, inside the classroom, classroom have a seat passports and I will line them up at the door. And I normally get my homework from my students. I never had an issue collecting homework from my students in my homework because you know if they don't have the homework you can't come. Maths is a subject that builds on itself.
