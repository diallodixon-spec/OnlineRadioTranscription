20251230 122721 In heaven above Do you believe in love? Don't tell a lie Don't be false or untrue It all comes back to you Open fire On my burning heart I've never been lucky in love My defenses are down A kiss or a frown I can't survive on my own If a girl walks in and calls her name in my heart I'll turn and run away Every day we're vowing let us stray It's hard to be lucky in love It kiss in your eyes, it's making you cry Don't know what to do, don't know What to do You're looking for love, calling heaven above
