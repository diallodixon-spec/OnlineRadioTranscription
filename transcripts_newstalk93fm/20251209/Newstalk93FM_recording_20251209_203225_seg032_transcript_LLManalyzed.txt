============================================================

Patience and time will not be going out my mind Say from the problems I don't worry cause I'm hard to find As I feel Safe like I just ran and slid across the plate Safe like we playing tag in your home base Safe like I got a big dog in the gate Safe like you one of these play in my face Yeah, you know I know you know that I'm that bitch, right? You got a girl that n***a wanna get, right? When I spass and I crash, you ain't gon' dip, right? That's when I need you the most, I get, right? Baby, I feel safe in your arms, I feel safe Saved like the money let it sit up in the bank Saved like a cold with the alarm, I feel safe Nobody got right by my side so high. I don't need a bridge to somebody that can make me feel safe. Yeah, look. I don't want a couple, but nobody ever made me feel safe like you. Facts. Because when I'm with you, I just know I'm fine. Know I'm fine. You take all the pride.
