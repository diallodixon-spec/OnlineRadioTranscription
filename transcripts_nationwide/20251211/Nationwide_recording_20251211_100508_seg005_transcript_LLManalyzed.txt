Welcome back, welcome back, welcome back. Thank you so very much for staying with us. There is an item of news I want to talk about, but I'm going to ask Lady Nora just to line up that story involving the rescue of that tender age girl out in Clarendon. I'm happy if you can line that one up for me, Lady Nora. I'd love to talk about that. Of course, it involves, you know, there are two people who are involved in this entire ordeal, a People's National Party councillor, Cian Barnswell, and his wife, Danielle. And, you know, they must come in for commendations this morning, yes?
