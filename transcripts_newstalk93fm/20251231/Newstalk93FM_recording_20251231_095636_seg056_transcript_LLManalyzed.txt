20251231 095636 Far away from the noise when she just wanna chill She wants to hear the birds and bees when they sing And I'm glad that she does cause it's my kind of thing You can call it a perfect match I'm just happy that you let me in Finally She loves me now And I believe somehow There ain't no perfect place Finally She wants to come and stay Can't wait another day And now I don't feel so far away 41 days, 42 nights, 43 nights, 44 tries I must say it felt a kind of way But it was only you in my eyes I felt pain when you refrained First time I asked you your name Now you're in my domain and you stay And you got me saying I ain't gonna leave
