20251219 105237 are you taking me out of the ordinary? I want you laying me down. So we're dead and buried on the edge of your night, staying drunk on your vibe. The angels up in the clouds are jealous, knowing we're foul. So let's go out of the ordinary. You got me kissing the ground around the sanctuary. Share with me what you've done. Lord, return me to dust. The angels up in the clouds are jealous, know what we've found. Something so heavenly, higher than ecstasy. Whenever you're next to me, oh mama. Where was it black and white? Until I saw your light I thought you had to die to fight Something so out of the ordinary How are you laying me down to a dead and buried?
