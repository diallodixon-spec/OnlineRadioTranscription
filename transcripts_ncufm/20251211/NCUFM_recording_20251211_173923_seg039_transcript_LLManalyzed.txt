2025-12-12 10:33:00 This is actually my first time on the program since the hurricane. I just got back light. I felt like I was in a daze, but thank God I am back. So, man, what was happening up closer to where you live? Is it that, like, maybe the light posts were down? What do you think was taking so long for the electricity to be restored? Happy to have you back on board. I'll pay you to get some light just in time for the evening. It was just recently, so we got back light here in Mandeville. But it was just recently, after light came back, then it went. And wow, the people them were mad out. Sister Phillips, good day to you. Welcome on board the drive.
