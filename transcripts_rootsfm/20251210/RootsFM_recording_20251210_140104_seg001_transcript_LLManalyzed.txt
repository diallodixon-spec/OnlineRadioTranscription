If we old and young come have some fun All of a sudden say the fun it got done Angels of brutality dressed in red, black and blue With the face of school I tell DJ Stringz we tell the crew We go home before him lock up or no Oh you feel like half the music Oh you feel like of sound The sound, the sound And I tell DJ Strings There's a time for him to go home Oh, you fall like half the music oh, you fell like like half the sound the sound, the sound and i tell DJ Strings there's a time to go home Nobody talk but the boss the staff, the cocky suit, and don't talk. Lock it off, or otherwise, lock up the whole of them fast. How you feel like afternoons?
