============================================================

Just promise me that you got it. I don't need roses. Just need some flowers from my garden Can't you go back to how you loved on me when you started? I'll be here begging for y'all. You should be giving me love all damn day till the day is done So if you wanna go that way, I'll be waiting for you to come pick up your clothes. I have been folded. Meet me at the door while it's still open. I know it's getting cold out. It's still frozen. came into my life while I was sinking I've been on that type of time
