2025-12-12 15:16:48 I believe that love is everlasting How it gets so normal, how it's so comfortable for sleep Man, this God don't want to wake up the devil I don't respond to what do wrongs, I don't like it Rather easy Time testing but I'm strong With love on my mind, love in my thoughts carrying on Why nobody no believe, in a love again Because every love that lost, nobody no believe in a love again Because every love that lost Nobody no believe in a God again Seems our faith is lost Nobody no believe and it hurts more Turn the lights on the world so dark Still I believe
