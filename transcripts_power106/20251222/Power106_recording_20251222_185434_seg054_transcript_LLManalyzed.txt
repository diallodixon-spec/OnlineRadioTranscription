20251222 185434 all for me to try and find him opponents that are willing to fight him but we're hoping to get him a fight by March hopefully and get him into into some big fights he doesn't want any more small tests he's getting older he's got the experience and the knowledge to fight the elite and he's proved it many times so look for you know Kamal Hitman Russell to be fighting hopefully in the first first two to three months of the new year Prospects for him like in the United Kingdom on the continent Yeah, yeah, that's actually where we've been trying to trying to get some guys and and the the mid-level guys don't want to fight him We're trying to get a him to fight against the top guys. The problem is that Kamal's boxing IQ is very, very high and he has crushing power and crushing accuracy that a lot of fighters don't want to face.
