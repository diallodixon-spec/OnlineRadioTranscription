My God, John, you don't have to say it so, you know. You don't have to diss the people in the company, so, right? Give yourself. Shout out to Lesan in Miami checking in right now. Sir Charles Morris, up on the wall Tom, pick up yourself. Who that, Carlynton, where you say you and the great staff listening on the bus right now? Yes I am, pick up to the great staff. Yeah man, pick up to everybody who works at Grace. Continue to make those awesome products. Never hear anybody complain about a Grace product yet. Never ever ever ever ever ever.
