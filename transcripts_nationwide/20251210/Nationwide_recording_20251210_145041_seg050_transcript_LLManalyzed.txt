Let your body move Cowboys and cowgirls are feelin' the groove Sippin' on moonshine Fire barrel rollin' I'ma get behind that thing girl and Rollin', rollin', rollin' Rollin' Oh, oh, oh, oh Yeah, my boo's on the ground Yes sir, Lord, I miss you Oh, oh, I miss you What you gonna say? What you gonna do? I like the way you move I like the way your groove I like the way that you set me on fire I wanna see you
