20251224 173017 There's a birthday party at the home of Arthur Grey It'll be the perfect ending of a perfect day We'll be singing the songs we love to sing without a single stop At the fireplace while we watch the Christmas ball There's a happy feeling the thing in the world's buy. When they pass around the coffee and the pumpkin pie. It'll nearly be like a picture print, my career and I. These wonderful things. Let's go! Come on, let's go!
