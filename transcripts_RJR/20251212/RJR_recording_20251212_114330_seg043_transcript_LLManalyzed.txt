2025-12-12 12:24:05 Yes, beautiful days though. So what is your name this weekend now? Call me Buster, because it's too much problem to remember. You can't remember Joshua. Call me Buster. I can't. I remember Joshua, but not for you. You are no Joshua. You know what was Joshua's role? Not Joshua in the Bible. Joshua as Mike Almanly. I understand that, but everything comes from the Bible. Everything under the sun. Even Michael was named from that Joshua. There was Archangel. Okay. All right. Thank you. Take care. All right. We're coming up on a break now. Watch DT. Do some push up the DT.
