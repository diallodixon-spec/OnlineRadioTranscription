20251224 094336 This sweating spirit of me feeling good! I have a lightning spirit Early in the morning I hat it Me cooler ready, my eyes done ready Me punching that's automatic I have a lightning jumbie A kind of energy inside me And it ready for the rum Ready, ready for the rum So let we go, let we go down the road, let we go It's action time, let we go, let we go down the road. Let we go, it's action time. Let we go. It's back-and-on time. Here we go. Hands up. This sweating spirit have me feeling good.
