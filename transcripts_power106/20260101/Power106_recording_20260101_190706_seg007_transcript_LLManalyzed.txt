20260101 190706 belongs to all of us. It proves that Jamaica can overcome problems once considered impossible to solve. Now, the hurricane also exposed another long-standing challenge, waste management. Our changing lifestyle and consumption patterns have increased the volume and types of waste we generate. This year, we will begin divesting garbage collection, mainstreaming waste separation in public institutions, and instituting a ticketing system for public sanitation and littering. As we make Jamaica safer, we must also make Jamaica cleaner and more beautiful. Jamaica enters this new chapter on stronger footing than at any other time in our history. Our economy is more stable. Our public finances are better managed. Our institutions are more credible. Let us use this foundation not only to rebuild, but to reimagine Jamaica. Let this new year be defined by clarity
