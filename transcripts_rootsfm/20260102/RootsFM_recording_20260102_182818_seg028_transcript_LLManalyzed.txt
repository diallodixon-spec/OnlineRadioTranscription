Love how you take it easy, you no climb or stop. True, are you the girl that get the money or she get it in a crush Proposal getting married and go from the hilltop. Come live in a big house it all pull out on a bop. Success get to her, she stomp come from the pot. Hand them a grip on her friend them said them a dead stop.
