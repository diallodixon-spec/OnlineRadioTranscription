Special music, Taziel Coley will be on, Wendy K. Brightson will be on, and the speaker will be our cruising captain here on NCUFM, Tiffany Johnson. That should be an interesting evening. Cars, cars, cars, you know? Pat from Texas, how you doing? Blessings every time. Auntie Sharon is still here with us. Novelette Clark, come on. Thank you, Sister Novelette.
