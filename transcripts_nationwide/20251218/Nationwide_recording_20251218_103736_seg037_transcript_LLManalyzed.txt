20251218 103736 Patrick Rowe 6745 is taking issue with me. He says Cliff said Vars would come under pressure if JPS doesn't deliver restoration across the island if JPS failed to deliver hmm I don't see how Vars should be blamed for JPS's incompetence says Patrick Rowe well I hear Patrick, but the politics of it is Mr. Vaz is a father. Yes, he has paternity for this initiative to lend JPS 150 million US dollars on the basis of JPS's commitment to deliver. So if JPS doesn't deliver, he will have to take responsibility. It was a policy driven by him. Yes. Some other reactions. Patrick Rowe repeating himself. Wayne
