20251216 131308 don't forget what's right That you really see the stars shine bright on that good time. Cause this world won't be easy. Doubt will come, believe me. Sometimes you'll wonder if it's alright. It's about to be a move. When you see what God is making. I can't wait for you to tell me that it's alright See I know, dreams can't play forever Especially in stormy weather It's hard to see where the road goes
