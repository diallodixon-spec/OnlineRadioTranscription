you should recover fully. Alright and the last thing I want to talk about is mental wellness alright. Now people I understand the need to want to be like the best superhero Batman in a time like this. There will be no questions at this time. Batman is the best and we're gonna move on. Alright now I understand people wanting to feel like you're super strong right now and you think you don't have time to pay your feelings any mind. Please don't do that. Make some time to address your anxiety or your fear or your discomfort coming out of the hurricane, alright? It's true because if you think about it, trust me, your emotions are much better. When they decide they need your attention, you cannot stop them. So, take the time to address them in a healthy way before they come out in not so healthy ways.
