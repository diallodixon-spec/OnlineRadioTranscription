20251224 144522 I live the proper way and let me read a chapter daily. Man, the inner city hungry and no heat. And food they don't know country does a drop off of the tree there. You see, self poverty no real then. It's what the rings did reveal. Who knows? Who knows, who knows, who knows? I just go with the trapping blows. Sending love to my friends and foes. And I suppose I'm pleased to be chilling in the West Indies To provide all my wants and needs I got the sunshine, rivers and trees Released clear When the rain pitter-patter on the roof Herb just a steamed pepper pot on the stew Life is a dream if you learn every day so be here
