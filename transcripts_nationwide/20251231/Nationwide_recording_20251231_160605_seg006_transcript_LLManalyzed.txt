Oh, you got plans, don't say that I'm sippin' wine in a robe I look too good to be alone My house clean, my pool warm Just shaved smooth like a newborn We should be dancin' and dancin' in the East Wing and the West Wing of this mansion, this mansion I ain't playin' no games Every word that I say is coming straight from the heart So if you tryna lay me down I'ma leave the door open I'mma leave the door open
