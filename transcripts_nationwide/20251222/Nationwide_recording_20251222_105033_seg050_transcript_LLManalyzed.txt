That is only one year. We are going to take it next year. Mr Bobby. Uh huh. Excelsior has now won the Manning Cup. Mm hmm. Eight times. Mm hmm. We had a drought that came to an end last Friday. Mm hmm. A drought of what? Twenty-one years? Right, yeah. And we intend to hold it for the next several years. Really? Yes. I would like to see that coming next year. We are doing a post-mortem to see where we go wrong. Yes. And we are coming back stronger in 2026. So don't be surprised and I only hope you can call
