20251230 210706 Happy work, man, happy work. You can make a make a thing before the sun goes up, won't you understand? We can sing on the side. We go baby, you turn to the ocean. Get up every day and do the juggling. Girls love you, don't do you think? Monarchy work, monarchy work. See street in the shop and do the ocean. Stand up for every day and do juggling.
