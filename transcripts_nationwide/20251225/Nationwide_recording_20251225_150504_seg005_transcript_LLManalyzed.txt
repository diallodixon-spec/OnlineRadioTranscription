20251225 150504 You tried everything, but you don't give up In my world, only you Make me do for love what I would not do My friends wonder what is wrong with me Well I'm in a daze from your love you see I came back to let you know Got a thing for you and I can't let go. You can't go on. As the night moves in, Love takes on new meaning.
