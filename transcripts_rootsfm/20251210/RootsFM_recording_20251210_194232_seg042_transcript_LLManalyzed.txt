============================================================

I am close beside me And whisper in you hold me Sweet words like I love you Won't you tell me a lie When our night is almost over Make it easy on us both When it's time for you to go Come on, tell me a lie Say you'd really like to stay Tell me just one more lie. You'll be back one day And you won't have to see me cry tell me
