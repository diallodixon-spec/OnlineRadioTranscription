2025-12-12 09:14:28 And I will be waiting for you But when you get there you just tell me You're not hungry at all You said you'd rather read the paper And you don't want to talk You like to think that I'm just crazy When I say that you've changed I'm convinced I know the problem You don't love me the same You're just going through the motions And you're not being fair I got my part, I will not cry Still I can't help but care I'm not the kind of girl that you can let down Don't let me down, don't you let me down
