20251212 145644 me just riding a boat and experience and here we are now here we are now look, our love is failing We've gone afloat, a soaring plane through cumulus clouds Gone aflame, no more endowed Fix it, oh, fix it That's what I do, that's what I do That's what I do Fix it, oh, fix it So you come through Love and war all Christmas with you
