I had a dream, we were sippin' whiskey neat I used to go with Valerie, and that was high enough Somewhere along the lines, we stopped seein' eye to eye Nationwide 9DFM! I won't be home and you'll be on your own Who's gonna walk you through the dark side of the morning? Who's gonna rock you when the sun won't let you sleep? Who's waking up to drive you home when you're drunk and all alone? Who's gonna walk through the dark side?
