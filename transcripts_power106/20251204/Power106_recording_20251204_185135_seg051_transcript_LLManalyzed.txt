============================================================

was an eye-opener for me where being in Europe, racing in Europe was, I mean, completely different. And that definitely helped me going into this year where I was much more comfortable. I mean, all the driving I've done in Jamaica for years and karting and all that, it adds up. But when you get to the European level and on European tracks compared to the Caribbean tracks, it's a completely different ballgame like Uncle Chris was mentioning. So having that experience from last year, it translates a big time into this year for sure. And I mean, it gave me a big edge, personally, because for me, always, it was the more practice I get. I usually say, if I have 100 laps on a track, then I should be very fast. And so having more of I get, I usually say if I have 100 laps on a track then I should be very fast. So having more than 100 laps on European circuits from last year, it definitely was a big deal and it gave me a big advantage personally to be able to go there and win.
