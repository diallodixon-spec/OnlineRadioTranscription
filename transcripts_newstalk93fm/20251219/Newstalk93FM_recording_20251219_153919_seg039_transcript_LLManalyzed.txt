20251219 153919 Our masterpiece, owned by my, owned by my love. I take one look at you, you're taking me out of the ordinary. I want you laying me down, to the dead and buried. On the edge of your knife, staying drunk on your ride. The angels up in the clouds, are jealous, knowing found something so out of the ordinary. You got me kissing the ground for your sanctuary. Shatter me with your touch, oh Lord, return me to dust. The angels up in clouds are jealous knowing we've found. Hopeless hallelujah. Holy side of heaven's gate. Oh, my life, I'll do you. Breathe and take my breath.
