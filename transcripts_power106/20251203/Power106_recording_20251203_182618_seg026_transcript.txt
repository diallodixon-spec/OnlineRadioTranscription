that so I'm happy for that. What I didn't understand was starting back in the league immediately after it finished but apparently there's some delay to it now but I think if they continue to grow along the same trend, same pace, in a few years we should see the league back to where it was or even better. Yes because there is some interest, some commercial, private sector interest, which is all... Yes. And once you get private sector interest in it, and the money is flowing in it, because it takes cash to care. That's what people want to see. Football is expensive. You know, I've seen a lot of owners or managers, presidents for clubs crying because it's financially expensive. So once cash is flowing into the program, then you should see a lot more teams stepping up and doing better. What I'd love to see one day is where sponsorship is really, really that big.
