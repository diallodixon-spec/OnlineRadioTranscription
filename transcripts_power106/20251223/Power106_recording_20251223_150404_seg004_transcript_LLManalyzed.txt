20251223 150404 All right, so we are encouraging you to give us a call here on both sides of the story. Let me get back to this message that I was reading earlier on before we had conversation with Alvin. And this message was from Marcia T. who was pointing out that the conversation this morning with Dr. Amina Blackwood-Meeks and Black Ellis did not have any conversation. Nothing was said about the Christmas sorrel and the fruitcake. So she's pointing out that Christmas is not the same without them. All right, she says it's just not Christmas without them. The sorrel is from Africa and the fruitcake from Britain. When I was a child, sorrel was only available at Christmas.
