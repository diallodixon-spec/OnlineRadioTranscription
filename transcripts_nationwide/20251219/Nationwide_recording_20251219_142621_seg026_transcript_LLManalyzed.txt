20251219 142621 And I don't care about the present Underneath the Christmas tree I don't need to name my stocking Live upon the fireplace Santa Claus won't make me happy With a toy on a Christmas day I just want you for my own More than you could ever know Make my wish come true All I want for Christmas is you I won't ask for much this Christmas I won't even wish for snow I'm just gonna keep on waiting For all I need in the mistletoe I won't make a list and send it To the North Pole for Saint Nick I won't even stay away too far
