Baby, girl, I wanna sit you down And let you know just how I feel It's been a long time since I felt so strong And much too long since love's been here Now I know there's many questions running through your mind. You're wondering have you found your love this time? Have you found the one who cares, who will always be right there? I know that song just changed your mind. Now your love, your love to me is very is very serious I won't play, I won't play games with you tender heart And when I look into your eyes and say I love you girl That's how I feel I'm for real, I'm for real
