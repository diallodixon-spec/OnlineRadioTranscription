20251218 111209 So we're saying to you that if you're going downtown with even $200,000 to spend, don't put the whole $200,000 in one place. You can put $30,000 in one pocket, the front pocket, the other pocket even on the authority, deep down in the bag where the last place got the last money you can spend. That's where you put the rest of the money or you divide it again. But first of all, why are you going downtown with 200,000? Because sometimes you have to buy one fridge. You have to buy one store, or you walk with the cash. Because that's what you get to pardon the money. Because if you get to pardon money, you have to walk with it. Because you have to buy a fridge for the holiday. Because it's something you save for in the ice. So you decide to go downtown and buy the fridge. You can't care half of the money go down. And then some persons probably don't have the account. You understand? So they throw the partner. And they have been doing that from January. It's now December, you get the drop. And you decide to say, go downtown, go buy the fridge, or you're not in the fridge and you don't have the money.
