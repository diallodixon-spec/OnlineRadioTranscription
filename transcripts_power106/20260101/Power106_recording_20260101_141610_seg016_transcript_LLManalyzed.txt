20260101 141610 Oh, you'll wake me up before you go cold. Take me dancing tonight. I want to hit that high. Yeah, yeah. When the gray sky's out of my way, you make the sunshine brighter than the dollar state. Turn the bright spark into a flame My beats permanent never been the same Cause you're my lady, I'm your fool It makes me crazy when you act so crude Come on up before you go go Cause I'm not planning on going solo
