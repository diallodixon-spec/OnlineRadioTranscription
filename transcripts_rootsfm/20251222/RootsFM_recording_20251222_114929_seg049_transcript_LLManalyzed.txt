20251222 114929 and in order. Thank you this morning Father for the gift of life that you have granted us to us one more time. We recognize even as we rejoice for this gift of life that many lay down last night but did not wake this morning. So we really truly thank you. May we use this day Father as you have now lent it to us to glorify you to our actions, to our words, to our deeds may we use this day father to leave glory and honor to your name and so far we ask you that you forgive us of our sins and cleanse us from our iniquities and oh god wash us and make us holy to stand continually before you and to worship you we pray you father for healing
