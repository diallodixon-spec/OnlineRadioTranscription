20251229 134743 I'll get over you I feel heavy on my mind, baby I just can't face the fact that you said goodbye Why you said goodbye? Why you made me cry? Why you left a lie? You said our love won't die Baby, I can't let this get me down I got my life to live, I got more love to give So I'm crying now, I know I can move through you. That tomorrow, I know, I can move though you.
