So I start to do a survey. I whatsapp all of my neighbour there. I say, hey, how you doing? What do you guys normally pay for? Because I look like I'm underpaid. They cut grass? Like Johnny. None of them have paid. One man has charged me four times. On the football field, behind the house. One man charged the whole of it. And I go outside and I say, let me ask you something. Why don't you sip on me? Why don't sip on me? I'm not the only one who wants to rap me, but you think I'm an idiot. It's not Jamaica, it's TV. That's the problem. That's the John, you know, somebody did buy one more one time. I was determined so nobody was coming back into me. I'm giving you. The whole avenue is paying me. I'm going to call a place named Rowan where they have cement coming out of the big truck.
