20260102 134031 Simon, please remind the caller who mentioned the tourism growth in the DR that the DR is a hot destination as it relates to sex tourism. Every woman over there has a BBL. What I mean? Yeah, I don't know that that's the reason. I don't suppose it hurts, but I don't think that's what the tourist trade is based on there. I remember some friends of mine in England, quite conservative, not travellers, not people who are home to different foods and different tastes and so on, and they had booked a holiday
