Professor Simon Kuznets, Russian-American economist, created the concept of GDP in 1934. It is defined as the total market value of all final goods and services produced by the country within a period, normally a quarter or a year. And he says you measure it in three different ways. This is a lesson for the minister. One, he calls it the upper loop, technically speaking, and all that mean is from the spending side. Spending by households, spending by private investors, spending by government, and the difference between imports and exports, net exports. He also says you can measure it from what he calls the lower loop, which means compensation to workers, rental income, interest income, and profits to firms.
