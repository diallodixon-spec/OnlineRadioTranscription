============================================================

I've called your name and suddenly your face appears But it's just a crazy game When it ends, it ends in tears Finally have a heart Don't let the world it's faith keep us apart cause I've been made to live alone through this house and to a home when I climb the stairs and I turn the key oh please be there to steal in love with me
