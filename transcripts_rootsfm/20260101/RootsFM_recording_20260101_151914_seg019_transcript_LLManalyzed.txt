20260101 151914 Gotta make a move real fast Take my life to the future from the past In my hands, I gotta take it slow There are things I like to know I've been mistreated oh so much Sometimes I don't know how I carry on You don't know, you never know Never a sign to show Come and walk a mile in my shoes And you would feel what I'm feeling from where I'm standing things don mile Only one mile, come walk a mile in my shoes
