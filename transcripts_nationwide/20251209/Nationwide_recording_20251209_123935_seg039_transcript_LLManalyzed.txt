6 a.m. on a Saturday morning. So when I go up there now hunting, there is a fellow who plays in a game beside my field. There's a field beside. So he always says to me, boy, you know, every week I pray for you, say your car broke down out of 89 holes. He said to me, Papa, if that ever happens, I'm going to Bantrick? Talk to me. I hear you this morning. Island Dairy is Jamaica best. How long now you think it is on the radio?
