So I just wanted to say, Merry Christmas to all of my friends and those who are associates. Merry, Merry Christmas. And my heart felt to the people in the west ward of the island, some of my family. I don't know if they are hearing or what, but I just want to say keep heart and the Lord knows everything best. And while the East are merry, I'm sure that persons out there looking out for those who are in the West and don't give up because they're alive and well some of you even though emotionally you might card so Merry Merry Christmas
