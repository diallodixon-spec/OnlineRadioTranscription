20251226 101920 Together, holding guns Hold on, don't fight, hang on to your love In heaven's name, why are you walking away? Hang on to your love, in heaven's name Why do you play these games? Hang on to you love, be brave The journey is rough It's not easy When you're in love Don't be ashamed When the going gets tough It's not easy Don't give up If you want to get stronger You better not let go You gotta hold on longer, you want your love to grow Gotta stick together, hand in glove Hold on, don't fight, and answer your love You can't say why are you walking away
