really difficult time to be and not really knowing where, you know, everybody stands and what it really looks like and what they're going through. And I think just in that moment, the emotions just started to erupt out of me and that's where the song really was born. The first line, it was just like, it feels like we don't have a choice. We don't have any time to get things right. Like as soon as we start to build ourselves as a nation, here comes something out of the blue from left field to really tear us down, you know? So that's really where it came from. It's a message, eh? It's a message to Jamaica in this difficult time. Absolutely. Through everything, we still, we rise stronger every time. It doesn't matter what comes against us. We really try to rise stronger every time and we were successful at it. So just because this might just be the greatest thing so far that's hit, it doesn't mean that it's going to keep us down. So that's really the message I was trying to convey. All right, one of the people I'm going to hear a little bit of the message. This is Don't Lose Faith, Libra Don.
