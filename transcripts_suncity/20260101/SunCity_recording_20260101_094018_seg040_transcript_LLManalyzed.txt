20260101 094018 I can't believe we're done Without feeling inside Where the world's lonely hearts go Under in the water, drifting in the sea Hiding from the thunder, come and rescue me The industry I'm reaching for the arms that let me know Where the sun's arms go Where does my heart beat now? Where is the sound?
