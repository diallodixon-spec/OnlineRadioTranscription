20251229 102215 When I see the clock ticking away And things are not in place Everything in life happens for a reason Disappointment comes with a lesson It's for me to get wiser Got to work harder In the end it will get better Lord I thank you for sunshine Thank you for rain Thank you for joy thank you for pain it's a beautiful day it's a beautiful If you've got life, then give God praise You may not have money, but you're living day by day
