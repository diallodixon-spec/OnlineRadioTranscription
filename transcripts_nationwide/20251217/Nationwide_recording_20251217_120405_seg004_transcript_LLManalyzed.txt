20251217 120405 That's how some leaders in the business community are reacting to the Jamaica Public Service Company's 7% increase on electricity bills for December. The Office of Utilities Regulation, OUR, announced the increase on Monday. The regulator says it granted the increase based on the usage of more expensive fuel in the period leading up to and immediately after the passage of Hurricane Melissa, Mahiri Stewart reports. According to the OUR, the 7% increase is just the beginning. It says JPS agreed to defer a portion of the higher fuel and IPP costs and recover them gradually over the coming months. Director-General of the OUR, Ansard Hewitt, is projecting that the increases could be stretched over the next six months. President of the Jamaica Manufacturers and Exporters Association, Catherine Silveira, says the first tranche of the increase has come too early into the recovery period.
