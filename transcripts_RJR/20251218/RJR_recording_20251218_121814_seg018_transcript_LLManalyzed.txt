20251218 121814 at night at the National Stadium Court. On Tuesday, G.C. Foster College came from behind and with 20 points and 15 rebounds from Lashane Wilson recorded a 70-59 win over UE for whom Joel Ricketts led the way with a game-high out today and play mixed defense. I mean, we play very good zone defense. So if that didn't work today, then we would have gone to man-to-man defense. So I mean, that would have helped to really force them to make some passes and get some turnovers as well. For the first and final quarter, we stick to the game plan. I mean, the second and the third, we drifted away a little bit from defense. So, I mean, that's something I would go back to and work on that so that when we get to the finals, I mean, the defense can be much better than how we played in the semifinal. That's Cleon Morgan, head coach of GC Foster College. Now, the UTEP Knights secured their ticket to the final with a close 51-49 win over Caribbean Maritime University.
