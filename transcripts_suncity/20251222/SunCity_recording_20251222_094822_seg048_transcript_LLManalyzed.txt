20251222 094822 life-loving relationships, big family gatherings, fun celebration, and here I am almost four years without a partner. The holidays just make me feel worse, like I'm missing out on something that everyone else gets to experience. I try to enjoy the season, but the loneliness hits hard, and sometimes it feels like I'll never find that special kind of love. I keep asking myself if there's something wrong with me or if I'm just destined to spend another Christmas alone. It's exhausting and makes me feel hopeless even though I know I shouldn't compare myself with others. How do you cope with the holidays when everyone else seems happy and you're alone? How do you stop feeling like you're missing out and start finding joy in your life? That is something that you have to.
