20260102 192316 This house in Portland, that just collapsed. It was a two-story house. Got no permission from the Portland Municipal Corporation to build. And the man said when he built the first floor, his wife said look, now she wants another floor. And he put another floor on without any recourse to planning or permission or inspection from the Portland Municipal Corporation. And what happened when, was it the six point something earthquake? It's gone, that building is have seen many storms before and even though I live in a vulnerable area, there's no need to evacuate.
