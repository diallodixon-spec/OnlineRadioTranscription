20251230 202010 There's nothing compared to you, I love you just the way you are. We're not alike, we're not alike. Love you, tell me what I'm praying. We're not alive, we're not alive. Hope you feel the same. We're not like, we're not like. Love you tell me what I pray. We're not life, we're not life. Hope we feel the same. Oh I hope you feel the same. Me no lie, me no lie. Love you, tell me what's right.
