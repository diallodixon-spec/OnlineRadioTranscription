20251212 175333 that I haven't got to call you before. And why is it I haven't seen you around anymore? Another year has passed and I can't erase the memory of your smiling face. So I had to call you up and say Gee whiz, it's Christmas So don't forget the party that we're throwing The warm fire from the fireplace will keep glowing. It's been a long, long time. I still can't figure out why you crossed my mind. I guess it's just good.
