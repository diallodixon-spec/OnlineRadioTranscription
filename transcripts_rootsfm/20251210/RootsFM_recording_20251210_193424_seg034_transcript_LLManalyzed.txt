Since I can't be with you all the time, girl, I'll keep playing the game in my mind. Oh, you're mine. Precious love. My first love. You're the one I plan to build my life around. Since there's no set length of time, ooh, that'll be just fine with me. Imagination, imagination, imagination, imagination.
