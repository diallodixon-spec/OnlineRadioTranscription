============================================================

I don't know why the people, they're starving. I don't wonder why the farmer man is balling. I cry, peel the end man, I beg you, peel some more. Peel for the rich and you are peeling for the poor. And I rub with my stick and I see the people adore. Grab up the microphone and when you drop on the floor, I get the beat. Midnight, I DJ till four. Five o'clock, I never sleep nor snore., transplant. Man, this is what I appreciate, y'all. You long to man a DJ in a down, long to man a tron in a down. We come to nice up the area, we come to nice up Jamaica. Go watch it, man.
