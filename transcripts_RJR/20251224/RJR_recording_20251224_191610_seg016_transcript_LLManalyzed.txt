20251224 191610 Welcome back to Beyond the Headlines. I'm Camille Williams and today we're having our special Christmas Eve program where we play songs chosen by members of the newsroom. And there is one rule and it is that songs have to be Jamaican or have a Jamaican artist or from the Caribbean. And so as I was saying before the break, the next song that we have is from Jadim Hall, and it is Christmas Time Is Here Again by Agent Sasco. Before I throw to that, I just want to read out our WhatsApp text line. Please send your messages to 876-254-0693. That is 8762540693. Send your Christmas greetings? I'll be reading them throughout the rest of the program. Alright, let's throw now to Christmas Time is Here Again by Agent Sasco, chosen by our intern, Jadim Hall.
