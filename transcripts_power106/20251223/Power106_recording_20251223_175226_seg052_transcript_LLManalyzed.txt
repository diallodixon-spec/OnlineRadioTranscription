20251223 175226 You better watch out, you better not shout, you better watch out I'm telling you why black Christmas Right after it now's raining And the door's shining blue Not sure how you know Say Adam and Eve went up my sleeve They never come down until they feel the breeze Me say the Christmas breeze I say no bother star spades I say that Christmastreeze I say you come from the east and then you come from the west I say that Christmas freeze I say Christmas come but once a year
