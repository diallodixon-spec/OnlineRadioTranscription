Follow the road on the righteous path. Still focus and can't just put you in your tatters, eh. But when you're wicked, them corrupt your heart. Do the right thing, become the work case of your soul. Take away yourself from trouble. From trouble, yeah. Cause it's coming left over. Take away yourself. From trouble. From trouble. I say mind is sinking, son. Take away yourself, from trouble. Take away yourself and trouble.
