20251222 143819 There is power, power, wonder working power. In the blood of the Lord. There is power. Power, wonder working power in the precious blood of the Lamb. The blood of Jesus ransomed me. He paid the price and set me free. Jesus The blood of Jesus runs on me. He paid the price and set me free. Everywhere I go, all over the world to know. The blood of Jesus, runs on me.
