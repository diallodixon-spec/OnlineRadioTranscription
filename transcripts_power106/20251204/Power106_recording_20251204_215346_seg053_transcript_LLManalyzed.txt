Make me remember When we were so in love It was only last year, this time in December I listened to the bells and I reminisced About me I hated those Christmas bells But I never knew that I could miss you like this. Honey, sugar, don't you miss me, don't you miss me. Come back, baby. Yeah, yeah. Hey.
