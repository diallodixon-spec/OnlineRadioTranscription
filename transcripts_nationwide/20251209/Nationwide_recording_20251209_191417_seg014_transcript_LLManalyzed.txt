I don't think I've ever seen the tree. How does it look? Can you describe it for me doc? Well the tree its leaves are shiny on the top part so they are really wide big leaves yeah some like two hands maybe sometimes you can have the leaves as big as two of your hands and it's shiny on the top very shiny and the fruits look like really small soursop so to speak right light green but as it ripens it turns light brown with some spots on it right and as a drink you simply just blend it how would you prepare the drink there are different ways to prepare it in fact the best way or one of the most common ways you prepare the noni fruit is allowing it to ripe then allowing it to ferment and the order is so strong
