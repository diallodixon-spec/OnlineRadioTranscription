20251226 205647 Thought I heard your voice yesterday I do want to say that I loved you then I realized That it was just my mind Laying tricks on me It seems colder lately at night And I try to sleep with the lights on Every time the phone rings I pray God it's you, I just can't believe That we've grown I miss you
