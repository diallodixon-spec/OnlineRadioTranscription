20260101 100606 We are blessed as a nation with faith in Almighty God, blessed with belief in one another, blessed with the support of our families, our friends, our diaspora, and our regional and international partners. But above all, our greatest strength lies within us. Our willingness to work together, to stay the the course and to build back better for generations to come. Our motto is out of many one people. Let us live these words not only in speech but in action and as one people let us recover. As one people let us move forward. Move forward as we have done since independence. Jamaica has overcome countless challenges and we have never given up and we must not give up now. Let us stay together, work together and build a stronger nation together for ourselves,
