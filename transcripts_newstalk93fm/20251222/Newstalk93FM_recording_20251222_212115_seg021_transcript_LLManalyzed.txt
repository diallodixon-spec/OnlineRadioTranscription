20251222 212115 We'll never let you go. One thing I have to say to you, I just say loving it can make me gravitate to you. Give me the compass, let me navigate to you. Fly up and say that my way to you. Deep as the blue sea, your love's flowing into me. And even though the waves out from this loving wave are deep as the dark blue, yeah? So accurate. I said I need your love.
