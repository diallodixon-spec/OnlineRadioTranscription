There were persons from every segment of society, from all industries who were there in support of racing. So appetite is there for it. It's just for us as leaders within the space to create a framework that includes persons who are interested and persons who really should be interested even if they're not as at this moment. There was a point in time when sponsorship and that kind of effort was very much a part in that there was never a race day when there was not a sponsored race and so on. That has not been the case in recent times. Do you foresee a day like that coming back?
