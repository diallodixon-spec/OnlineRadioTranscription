20251226 152011 the plate to make it look small? I don't know how Doreen does this. It's like she takes a small amount of each and neatly packs them together. I certainly would not have been my plate. I'm telling you. Doreen, I'm proud of you. How much time do you go back though? That's the question. You see them kind of plate, you know, of food. You need to sit down on the back step of your yard, out of door. You know, sit down round table with that kind of food. You sit down on a back step or you sit down on the one tree or one block or something. Yes. And you spread out. And you relax yourself. And breathe up. Yes, because... Breathe back safe stuff. Yes, yes. She says, ah, princess, I show at like ten fireside and a trillion pepper seed. All right, princess. Love you, love you, love you. All right. Can't they find the plate? They can't find the plate. They can't tell me, all right, they can't find the plate. They can't find it. They can't tell me, alright they can't find it, tell me what to eat for Christmas dinner. Cause I know they can't, cause you see the plate share out, then I'm about to take a picture. That's my problem. Alright, we'll give them some more music.
