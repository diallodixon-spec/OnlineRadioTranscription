I was so impressed by it. I'm like, who did this? Like, this is so nice. Big up on yourself, man. Because Jamaicans, sometimes we don't feel like we're superheroes over here. Yes, it was, me like it. Me like it, me like what we're doing. Even when I went, where was I? In Barbados, and then me talk about the Jamaican babies that they have on social media. The last one I saw, they were asking the babies why they don't like going to church on Sunday. It was hilarious. It was hilarious! Oh man! The babies said, I don't wake up good. I drop a seat. I wake up good and they want me to go early morning. It was so funny. You can't get breakfast if you don't get to go to church. Take a break. We'll be right back. This is the Two Live Crew on a Culture and Legend Thursday.
