This is the first time I'm calling. Welcome. Welcome, welcome, welcome. Lovely. Before I talk about the Christmas. Can I tell you something? Mm hmm. I just want to tell you guys I'm doing a fantastic job. Thank you. The first time I started listening to Nationwide, I was driving on my way to the country and browsing, you know. Yes. To hear something because I was listening to music, hardly listening to the radio. Mm hmm. And I was browsing and I got hooked on I can't remember the conversation, please feel so saddened. And let me tell you something. I've never stopped listening to nationwide things. Happy to hear that. I brought you the trans picture when you didn't come to the store. And I have this on my little desk outside.
