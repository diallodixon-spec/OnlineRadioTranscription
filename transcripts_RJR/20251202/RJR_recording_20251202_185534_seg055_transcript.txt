96 ranked Jamaicans swept both matches against the world's number 16 ranked Puerto Ricans having also won the first leg match 92 90 last week Friday also in Puerto Rico The team also became the first country in the history of these qualifiers to score 90 plus in his first two games Head coach Rick Turner was a full of praise for their history-making efforts in Puerto Rico. Our guys came out and really focused and were ready to take the punch from a Puerto Rico team that who had their backs up against the wall a little bit in desperation to try to get a win out of this first window and you know we know, we stepped up and met the call. I think shooting the ball, especially early on, was helpful for us. We got away from Kofi Coburn a little bit more than we had hoped, but our perimeter players were able to balance that out.
