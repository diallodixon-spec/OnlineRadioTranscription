20251226 213129 So relaxing. I'm falling, I'm falling As I lay my bed with my head to the ceiling Say I'm drowning alone and I'm lost in my feelings Somebody send me a sign cause you know that I need it Can't even come back to me cause you know you're my healing. I said it's okay, it's my time I pay, time I pay, my time I pay. If you can't wait, all of my anxiety, anxiety, my run my day. I tell you that we all need love.
