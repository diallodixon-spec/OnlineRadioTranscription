20251218 203829 Icing on your cake the cherry on the top it's heaven in my heart and we could find you some space I could be the world to you the missing piece the extra sentimental kind of chemistry some people make it hard with me that isn't the case cause I make it so easy to fall in love so come give me a call and we'll fall into us. I'm the perfect mix of Saturday night and the rest of your life. Anyone with a heart would agree. It's so easy to fall in love with the way I do my hair, the way I make you laugh, the way we like to share a walk in Central Park. I could be fresh air, might be the girl of your dreams.
