2025-12-11 21:33:01 has to be taken on duty of care. What is the best route for the well-being of all students and not what is easiest or most convenient for parents or for families? I think that's the first thing that we have to reassess. I think the next thing that we're going to have to look at is if we're operating on the limited resources or various financial constraints, it's at a security expense. In any small company, in any small school, it is not cheap. And so I know from the question that was just asked, we're looking at, well, how would one security officer have been sufficient? But we also have to look in the alternate as to what was the school able to afford. And in lieu of adequate resources, how can we now redeploy the human resources available? How can we manage the dismissal of students on different time schedules for better measures or better security measures?
