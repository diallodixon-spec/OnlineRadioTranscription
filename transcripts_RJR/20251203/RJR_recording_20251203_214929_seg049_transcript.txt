Oh You wanna get your sunshine, you wanna get your sunshine Show me what you got to find, you wanna get, you wanna get Your sunshine, you're falling in love, you wanna get the sunshine You wanna get, you're gonna get your sunshine Waitin' all week, now five for my money So the weekend comes for five with a hunny. Rollin' down the street, I felt ill when she was mumblin'. I winked my eyes, got into the ride, went to a club and jumped in. Make me keep myself afloat, she said, you're a liar. I said, I got it goin' on, baby doll.
