20251230 133820 How I'm gonna do without your touch, your touch And I can't stop thinking about the loving that I'm leaving now so much Until you come back to me then Would you believe me? Who'd suffer like you since my war? You always catch me when I fall When the tour bus drop off and all light lock off And I'm a mere mortal again A mortal they live full and all the fans gone home I'm glad that you're more than a friend But when your love is life changing And I couldn't be the same without you darling
