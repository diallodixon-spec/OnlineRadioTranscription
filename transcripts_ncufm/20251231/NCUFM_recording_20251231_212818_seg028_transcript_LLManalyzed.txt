Though if you've been playing all your days by year Never knowing what the song was to be Then pull up a chair, get down your hair And take a few lessons from me We listen to the trumpet of Jesus While the world is a different town We watch to the jumping of God Almighty While the others just wandered around And the number of the Holy Doors travel again We're moving on up to a better land We hear the voice of a supernatural song it's been two thousand years
