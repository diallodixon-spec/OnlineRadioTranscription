20251231 202525 There's times where I might do it just to do it like it's nothing. There's times when I might blow like 50k on a vacation. For all my soldiers just to see the looks on all their faces. All it took was patience. I got a lot of friends to come up off the strip for me. The same ones that'll come up off the hip for me. The realest say your lyrics do for me. I told my story and made his story. Telling mama need reservations for 20. I never really been one for the preservation of money, nah I'd much rather spend it all while I'm breathvin the crew Cause we runnin' like a C-4 Cop said I'm rosy
