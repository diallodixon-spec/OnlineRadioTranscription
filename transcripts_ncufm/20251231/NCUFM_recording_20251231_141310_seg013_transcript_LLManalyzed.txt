20251231 141310 Can you believe it? What a god we serve. Indeed. Sitting on the bus in my seat, I'm reflecting on god's goodness and giving him praise and thanksgiving for seeing us through the year 2025. If it wasn't for Jesus, you wouldn't be here. That just want to send a big shout out to those that are celebrating today. Janelle Lawrence that's celebrating her birthday. All the best as you celebrate your special day. And to our former cruising captain, Tiffany Johnson and her husband Darren, I wish you all the best, as you the gift of love. Cheers everyone! Vroom vroom!
