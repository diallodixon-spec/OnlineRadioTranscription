20251216 160506 We have a one way ticket to greatness, greatness Yell at the world to lie Cause I believe in the truth And I just wanna live good I don't want no dirty secrets fighting me and you, boy I could only drive one car at a time But I still want to, but I still want to And let me get to the truth, truth, truth I just wanna live good, good, good Know the sun could shine the same time with the moon Boy, I could only drive one car at a time I'm telling you, but I still want to But I still want too And when we say, hey, set up yourself now Brace yourself now This kind of truth good for your health now I know it might hot up your head now. I hope I didn't set up myself. Love comes from a place where we don't get jealous. And we don't live like no dream sellers. I say we keeping it real. I'm telling you like it is.
