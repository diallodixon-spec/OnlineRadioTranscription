I'll be home for Christmas, and you can count on me. Count on me! Count on me! Bees have snow, and mistletoe and presents under the tree. Under the tree. Christmas Eve will find me Where the love light gleams I'll be home for Christmas If only in my dreams I want to wish you a Merry Christmas A Merry, a Merry, a Merry Christmas I'll see you tonight, I'll be here
