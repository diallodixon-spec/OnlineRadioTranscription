And you don't try to stop me crying, so don't say You do what you want, I do what I like You ain't have to get no change Cause when it comes to party, I ain't such a man And I know when we come to party, we don't have a plan You don't tell me, why not who I want you for? Why not who you like, baby? We do it with me, you're sick So when you're ready, you drop a call who you want to love But why not call who I like? And it's your kill to whine on everybody inside, yeah
