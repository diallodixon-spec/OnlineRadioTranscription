20260101 174532 Hi Michael, God has been more than good. I would never complain. I give him thanks for all that he has done and what he continues to do. Shadia, welcome. Looking forward to the new year and she can celebrate her birthday again. Blessings to Shadia. Brother Rickman is giving God thanks for protection and provision and life in 2025. Looking forward to seeing what 2026 has in store. He's a living witness of God's mercies. The man from Plowdon and the people from Plowdon shout out. Happy birthday to Dr Grace Virtue, the first student at Crosskeys High School to earn a doctorate degree. Dr Grace Virtue
