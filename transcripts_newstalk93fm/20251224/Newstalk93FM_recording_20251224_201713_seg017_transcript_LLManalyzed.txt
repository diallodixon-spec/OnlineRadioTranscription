20251224 201713 I wish I knew All I want for Christmas is you You, baby Oh, I won't ask for much this Christmas I won't even wish for snow And I'm just gonna keep on waiting Oh, I need the mistletoe I'm will make a list and send it to the North Pole for singing. I won't even stay awake to hear the magic rain display. Cause I just want you here tonight, holding my heart to me so tight. What more can I do? Oh, baby, all I want for Christmas is you. Ooh, baby. Oh, all the lights are shining so brightly every night.
