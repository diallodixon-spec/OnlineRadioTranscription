It's a family Christmas, it's a family Christmas We're moving from house to house and we're praising Jesus. It's a family Christmas, it's a family Christmas. We're moving from mouse to mouse and we're serving Jesus. Christmas is a time to celebrate. Get 30 ham and bring the cake. Everybody come and listen to this sweet barang music now. Everybody come together as one.
