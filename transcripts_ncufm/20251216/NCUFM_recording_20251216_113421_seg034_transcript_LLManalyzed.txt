20251216 113421 I am Geneva Spa Therapy at Carlos Escape Day Spa. Around this time of the year, the weather is usually colder and we experience more dry and windy conditions. The cold temperature and the low humidity level results in dry air that draws moisture away from the skin. Likewise, the harsh wind and dry indoor heat can make the problem worse and lead to cracked or even bleeding skin. Skin conditions such as eczema or psoriasis may also flare up during these cold and dry months. As such we have to constantly repair the moisture our skin needs. It's typical for us to wear jackets and sweater and even gloves
