2025-12-12 16:10:41 believe that you should be afraid to ask because we're all here to help and serve each other, as you said, Dr. Samaj. So I do believe we should lean on each other in this difficult time. You know, we're all willing to give and, you know, maximize on that in any way possible. Awesome. Thank you so much. If I may just add a piece to that. I like to remind people that my first 12 years of life was below Torrington Bridge. Make that sink in. Below Torrington Bridge and I largely grew up in one room. My mother, she was so brilliant. She remind people that sometimes the room is so small that if we're in the room and you want to change your mind, you have to go outside and change your mind and come back in. That's funny. You hear me? Yeah, yeah, but we get it. But she made it clear to me that, listen, we live here. It doesn't mean we belong here.
