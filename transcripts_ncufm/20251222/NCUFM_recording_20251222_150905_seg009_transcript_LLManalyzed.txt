20251222 150905 Okay, so I'm looking in the WhatsApp line and I see Auntie Dawn, Dawn, Neil is saying good morning Matthew. It is barge. That is okay, that is okay. Somebody must come on my team by the time we catch the homework helpers, it's alright. No one on this team. But that's alright. In a little drop time family, I have the Foster Triplets, a group we love so much, singing something that we're all going to be singing right about now. I do not like it. I hate it. Talk. I don't like it.
