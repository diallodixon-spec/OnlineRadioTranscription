20251225 112310 the wise men follow the stars the way i follow my heart and then lead me to a miracle hey love don't you buy me nothing I am feeling one thing Your lips on my lips That's a Merry Merry Christmas It's the most beautiful time of the year Lights fill the streets, spend so much time I should be playing in the winter snow But I won't be under the mistletoe I don't wanna miss out on the holiday But I can't stop staring at your face I should be playing In the winter snow, but I'ma be Under the mistletoe
