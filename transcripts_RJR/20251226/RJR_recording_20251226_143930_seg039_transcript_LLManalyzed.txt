20251226 143930 I would have a theme every year so whether it's vacationing and I think about what you know best hairstyle would go with somebody who is like probably sailing maybe I want the you know the the hair to be curly and wavy so it's like blowing in the wind right and then other times I might need her to have braids or you know bantu knots or something like that so it's really just thinking about the composition of everything like Obviously, you're not necessarily gonna see the movement of the wind on us on a boat If you have Bantu knots, but if you have curly outlay, you know hair out or a ponytail You'll be able to see that kind of wispy air going And then for Bantu knots, maybe she's curled up on the couch reading a book and you know like so it just depends on the setting that the person is going to ride. A lot of people, self-included, believe that they just cannot draw. What's the biggest misconception?
