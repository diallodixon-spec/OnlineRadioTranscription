Question number one. What can I do? Question number two. What can I say? To try to let you know. I appreciate all of the ways you get me through my day. Never would have thought I would be here. A heart with no scars. A face with no tears. How can I thank you? How can I show you wish I could get the whole world to know you? If they only knew. You are the one that gives me the air to breathe. And I can't deny You're the reason why my life has a melody And even when I spray Still they always pullin' me close to you So no matter where you are just know I'm not far Without you what would I do? You bring the sun up You're the reason I'm living I was hurting but I'm happy again You bring the sauna Thought I wanna thank you cause You bring the sauna To make my life grow You bring the sauna When I had nothing You've been with me from beginning to end You bring the sauna No clouds in the sky
