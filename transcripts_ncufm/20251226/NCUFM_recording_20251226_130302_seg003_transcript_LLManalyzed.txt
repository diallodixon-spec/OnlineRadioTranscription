20251226 130302 Though I know I don't have everything that it takes to keep loving me And regardless of every mistake that I make you keep loving me And it probably don't matter what I do or say you keep loving me Even with the pimples on my face you you keep loving me. So you just keep loving me. I want to thank you for loving me. Oh Lord, I thank you for always loving me. Oh, I know I don't deserve it. You keep on loving me. And I know I didn't do nothing for it.
