The Christmas tree at the Christmas party hop Mistletoe hung where you can't see Every couple tries to stop Rocking around the Christmas tree Let the Christmas spirit ring Later we'll have some pumpkin pie And we'll do some caroling You will get a sentimental feeling When you hear the voices singing Let's be jolly, let the halls with vows of party Rockin' around the Christmas tree Have a happy holiday Everyone dancing merrily In the new old fashion way
