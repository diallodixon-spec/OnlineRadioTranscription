Sweet Jam Dong, the only problem is Dallas Naron, what a nice place we live. Sweet Jam Dong the only problem is, Dallas Naron is a Jamaican. My argument is, whoever said them clever them to stop the promises and just mass production in all the parishes. And Jam Dong will progress like all the countries. What a nice place to live. Sweet Jam Dung the only problem is, dollars not run. Jamaica and Jamaicans are extremely great. Appreciate love by people, some say appreciate wealth. Since we know that, make we concentrate, and hopefully make the dollars start circulating. What a nice place to live. Sweet jam, the only problem is, dollars not run, say what a nice place we live. Sweet jam down the only problem is dollars not run, from money inna your pocket and your inna your heart. Crowd of people, what more you want? Reggae music a playa, reggae hop is a chat, I have some in my barn and I'm in a truck.
