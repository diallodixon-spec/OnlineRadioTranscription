So when you eat my brain, give me one look and I'll just partake But they say, take your time when you go down there You go spin all your coin and end up in a day But I ain't afraid, I'm gonna take all the chances I been waiting so long, I want it night and day My lady, give me a piece of that chup-chup, darling One piece of that Chup-Chup, darling So long you've been saving it, non-stop you're like craving it I want some of that Chup Chup, darling
