Look for a home choice, sour extract on the shelf, pull the bottle, go well, go home, buy, pull a bottle, pour, pour to your liking, add your ginger extract from home choice, which I also produced, but it's already naturally spiced, right? Nice. Perfectly. So all you do is just add your sweetener, whether you want to add sugar or honey, whatever you like, pour, mix, and you're good to go. Good to go. Let me ask you, what has, what has been the feedback for these products so far? Just to add before that question, right? So you know you always have sorrel on the shelf in the fridge and in the supermarket. The difference with this is you add your own sugar so it doesn't have a lot of different chemicals in it if you're supposed to buy it from the shelf in the supermarket. So you're going home, you're preparing it it in mixing it So this is as best you can get it if you were to do it and steep it by yourself So that's that that's a big difference there. So I just want your listeners to know that so buy your thing Add your sugar to it yourself. Yep, and you can add anything you want and of course
