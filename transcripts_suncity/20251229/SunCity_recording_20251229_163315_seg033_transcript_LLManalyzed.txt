Ask your clearing agent to provide your customs declaration, customs assessment notice, and customs receipt once duties and taxes are paid. Where your clearing agent may not be able to provide the IM-4 or IMS-4, request your customs goods declaration registration number or C number, which can be used to verify your payments.
