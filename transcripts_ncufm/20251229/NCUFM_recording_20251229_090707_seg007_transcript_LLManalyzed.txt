20251229 090707 upon a cross isn't that just like oh isn't that just the eyes that see a sparrow fall sees my need before I call. Isn't that just like God? Isn't just like God? When I question if He even cares, He answers my unspoken prayer. Isn't just like, isn't just like God. The hands that hold the world in place Can feel my pain and then erase The sin that my own soul creates Isn't that just just like God?
