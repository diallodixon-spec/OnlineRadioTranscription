Calling legal immigrants in the United States, here go American citizens like yourself, garbage. I'm going to ask you one more time. Do you not have a problem with the President of the United States calling a whole group of people of one ethnicity garbage yeah yeah I would not agree for him to call them all garbage because no no but some people be their behavior is like putting them right down there too because if they don't care about him they speak what what you doing here it is not your president what are you doing here that is only Omar who that. It's only Omar who said, that not the entire Somali population in Minnesota. He should not call everybody. I'm not saying you can't use everybody.
