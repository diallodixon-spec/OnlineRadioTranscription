20251217 094923 you're in Africa because you're gonna make sure that there's a difference. And you always remind me that I was going to be a mayor of one of these cities in South Africa. And I'm always reminding that I'm a UNIA president. I've been appointed the UNIA lady president for Southern Africa. So also that for me is a big deal because it means that I carry the weight of a long-standing institution of worth and knowledge and integrity built by one such as Marcus Mazaya Garvey. So aside from this appointment, being the Lady President for the UNIA here in Southern Africa also helps me to push forward the Pan-African work, also to push forward the recognition of Jamaica and what we have done as emancipators, not just for ourselves,
