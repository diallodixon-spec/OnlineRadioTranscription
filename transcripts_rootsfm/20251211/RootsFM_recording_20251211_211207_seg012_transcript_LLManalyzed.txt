2025-12-12 09:07:47 I'm the only one This girl needs more than occasional hugs If I'm talking of love If you feel it in your heart and you understand me Stop playing for your own Everybody sing along with me I'm the kind of girl that can treat you so sweet no i can't forget this evening or your faces you were leaving but i guess that's just the way the story goes You always smile but in your eyes your sorrow shows Yes it shows
