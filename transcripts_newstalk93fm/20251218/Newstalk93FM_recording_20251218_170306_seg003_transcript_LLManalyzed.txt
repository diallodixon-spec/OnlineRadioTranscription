20251218 170306 Come and meet me here in the truck and we rev it up Say cool day, keep throwin' it back I know why you stopped us up Baby no way, we could post up all the pictures you want When you're ready, I could overshare Lolly, you could overshare But we could meet in the middle and start a bacchanal Play in the middle hey, what we gon' do now? Jam to a rhythm and eat a carnival But we be we gonna do now? Start a wine on it. I say compromise on it. Baby, spend time on it. as it compromises me. I don't care, I don't care. We are the island, I tell you I'm sorry.
