20251231 161407 from Complex Ricky. You're doing this music, you know, make a change. Of course, it's going to be making a change. I mean, literally, the song is perfect within itself. The name of the song, all proceeds with this song is going to be assisting those who need it. But for Complex Ricky, the overall view of 2025, how do you feel as an artist? Do you feel like you did some of the things that you wanted to do for 2025 creatively and what can we expect come 2026? Okay, so 2025 was about keeping my head down and recording the music, getting the stuff, because this is my first release this year. Oh, really? Okay. So with my new management everything. So, 2025 was about working. I was really excited. I got to make music. Like I tell you, I'm working from scratch, making the beats and the instrumentals and everything. 2026 now, before I get to hear the music.
