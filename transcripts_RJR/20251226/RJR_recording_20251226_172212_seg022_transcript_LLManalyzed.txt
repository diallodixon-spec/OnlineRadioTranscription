20251226 172212 I really appreciate this opportunity to be on your show. Wonderful. Shane, let me start off with you. You are the pilot. You are pilot of Jamaica's two and four man bobsled team. Now, when you cross the finish line and realize that you want Jamaica's first ever international goal in bobsled, what was your reaction? What was going through your mind? I was like speechless. The wind feel felt unreal because when I crossed the line I was thinking that the time would be rounding up but it didn't it just stuck stuck and I saw the number one and I just couldn't believe that we actually won. I was very excited even when I go home I was like damn did I really win and it just slowly sunk in that I won the race I felt so good. Junior you are the brake man as it were track and field athlete
