20260101 152116 Good Lord, you have answered my prayer From all the strains and misery You have lifted me up, oh, and puttin' me higher From from all sins and misery and born again to be and free from sins oh boy and born again at last and free from sins. Listen, verily, verily they say, except a man but born of the water, he cannot see the kingdom of God.
