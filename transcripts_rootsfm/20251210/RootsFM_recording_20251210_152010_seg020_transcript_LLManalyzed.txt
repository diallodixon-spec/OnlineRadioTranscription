You know. I'm high looking ready, so me turn on a look and breathe. Just the way you try, do I try frighten on me? You just look like Christmas, you look like Jackson. But now I make y'all bands tell me pretty, pretty. Me pass through, no Christmas, me see no Santa Claus, I make a sound and you're all ready. Follow this. Manning up and up, manning up and up. Manning up in the house with dress, manning up. Pure, pure, pure, pure.
