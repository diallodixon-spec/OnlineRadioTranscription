============================================================

I see the people of the world coming out to dance. Cause there's music in the air and lots of loving everywhere. So give me the night. Give me the night. So come on out tonight. And we'll leave the others on a ride through paradise. if you feel alright Then we can be lovers cause I see that starlight Look in your eyes But don't you know we can fly Just give me the knife. Give me the knife.
