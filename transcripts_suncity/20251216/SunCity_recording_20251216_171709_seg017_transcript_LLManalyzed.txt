20251216 171709 Under the mistletoe The wise men followed the star The way I followed my heart And it led me to a miracle Don't you buy me nothing Cause I am feeling nothing Your lips on my lips Love to merry merry Christmas It's the most beautiful time of the year Lights fill the streets, spend so much time I should be playing in the winter snow But I'ma be under the mistletoe Shawty with you Shawty with you Under the mistletoe
