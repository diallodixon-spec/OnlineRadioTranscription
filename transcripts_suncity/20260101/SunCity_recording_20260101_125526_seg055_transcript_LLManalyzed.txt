20260101 125526 I'm missing you now And it's driving me crazy I'm meeting you baby I'm missing you I can't wait to be alone with you I'm sure you are missing you I'm missing you, missing you Baby, I'll shut your hole and you can't see me I'm missing you now I know We'll be together It won't be long, it won't be long But it feels like forever
