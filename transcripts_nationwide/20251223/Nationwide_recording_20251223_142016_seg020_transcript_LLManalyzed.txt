20251223 142016 When you're not next to me Yeah, you're breaking my heart, baby You make a mess of me Problematic Problem is, won't you party like a fiend? Like a bad habit Bad habits, how to break when I'm with you Yeah, I know I can do it on my own But I won't let people move like magic And it takes two, problem ready Problem is when I'm with you, I'm an addict And I need some relief, my skin and your teeth Can't see the forest through the trees Got me down on my knees, darling, please Oh, I'm blue, I'm falling apart right in front of you, can't you see?
