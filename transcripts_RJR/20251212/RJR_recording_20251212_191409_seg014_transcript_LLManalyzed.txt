20251212 191409 born hating another human being on the basis of the color of their skin, their religion, gender, any other factor. A child has to be taught to hate. And if he can be taught to hate, they can be taught to love. Thank you. Think equal now teach empathy in many countries, including India. And in Uttarakhand, the state where the victim of the horrific attack went to university, Leslie says every kindergarten child there between the age of three to five will now be taught about empathy. That's approximately 900,000 children every year. If I was a six-year-old child in a classroom, what do these lessons look like? Could you break that down for me? Now, I know, as a former film maker, that empathy, the best vehicle for empathy is narrative, its characters, its story. If I want you to feel what it is to be another human being, there's no better way than to tell you that story. Oh, this is interesting.
