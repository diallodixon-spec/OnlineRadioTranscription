One night made by Puma. Said don't live for life, but don't live for rumor. That's why you not see them say you a f**k. Bees are you fly, oh them a pray for you, John Ford. See none can calculate when you walk out. Tell them all you friend, what them all do on my program, they say. But see I can't do it with you. They are like the trees, I can't move. They can't show me if it's better or worse. Best friend a come to take your life for the worst thing you could ever see. How can a man not even pay a week from your bond to not be your enemy? I mean I know, but I don't want a friend from them.
