============================================================

Can I provide further clarity? Sure. But what can I say, this is no one could be speaking to. Mr. Powers, you on, Mr. Morgan. Mr. Morgan, sometimes, and sometimes what is said is not actually at one with the script that they provided. So I like to use what they actually say. But let me understand from, if Mr. Senator Morgan is correct, what is the issue that the opposition has at the moment? There is no issue. If the government will be lending the company a hundred and fifty million US dollars to get everybody back their lives, how can there be an issue?
