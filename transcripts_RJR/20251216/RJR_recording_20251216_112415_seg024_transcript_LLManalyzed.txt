20251216 112415 to you while they are here. I can relax and say to myself that Anthony Smith knew how much I rated him and how much I respected him and appreciated him. So I don't have to say why. The only thing I can say is that my condolences to his family and the rest of our colleagues. But me and Tony did good. Come on. Let me take a call. 876-9262178, 9268631, 9267615. I think I have you on the line. Good morning. I'm Dr. Taylor. Hello. Hi. Bless you. Good morning. Hello. Hello. I am hearing you. I am on 8631. Is that the line you're answering? I think so, yes. Go ahead. I'm hearing you. Can you turn your radio off?
