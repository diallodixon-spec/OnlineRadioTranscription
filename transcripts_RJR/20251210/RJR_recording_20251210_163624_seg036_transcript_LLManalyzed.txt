Trying to pack some songs in there. Good afternoon to Auntie Faye. That is a national treasure, Faye Ellington, for you. I will know it's a matter of time When you love someone When you love someone It feels so right, so warm and true I need to know if you feel it too Maybe I'm wrong Don't you tell me if I'm coming on too strong This heart of mine has been hurt before
