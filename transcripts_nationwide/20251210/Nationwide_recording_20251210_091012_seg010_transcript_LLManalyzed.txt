============================================================

We have assumed operation, as we know, within 48 hours of the hurricane, and since October 30th, more than 3,600 tankers have been loaded, along with over 60 tankers at Montego Bay facility. The Montego Bay facility is now back to normal loading operations, which is good news, especially for the West, and our national fuel inventory remains within the internationally accepted comfort range of two to three supply and shipments continue to arrive following the completion of the refineries maintenance shutdown on November 30th. All our airports managed by airports authority have resumed operations, though the levels of impact differed significantly. Sandstone International, as you know, sustained the most damage. Relief flights began operating there on October 30th, followed by commercial operations on November 1st.
