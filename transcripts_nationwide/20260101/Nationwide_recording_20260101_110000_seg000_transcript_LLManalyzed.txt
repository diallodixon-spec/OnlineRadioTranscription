20260101 110000 Feel like we're on another level Feels like our love's intertwined We can be two rebels Breaking the rules, me and you, you and I All you gotta do is watch me Look what I can do with my feet, baby Feel the beat inside I'm driving, you can take the front seat Just need you to trust me It's like nine It's like I waited my whole life For this one night It's gonna be me, you and the dance floor Cause we only got one night Turn the lights off in this place And she shines just like a star And I swear I know her
