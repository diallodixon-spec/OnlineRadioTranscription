20251225 093823 When I wanted more than I could handle at the time When I needed you, but turned you away You wouldn't let me slip out of your hand I just didn't know But now I understand So thank you for the times you said no Thank you for the doors that you closed All the ways you never let me go And the things you never gave me So many times I didn't understand I wouldn't let you take my hand But now I want to fall at your feet And thank you for the things you never gave to me
