I wish my wife and my sweetheart could be friends. And when we going on a date, me I bring both of them. I wish my wife, and my sweetheart, could be friends. She's my sweetheart. And when the three of us are apart, there is no problem. You see my wife, she like my sidekick You see me sweet, don't call her no sidekick Imagine up in the house and we inside it The possibility of it happening keeps me lively But dimension not a big trouble So far a peaceful life, a girl is off the juggle It would be nice if some of these nights, the three of we are cuddly I don't want to hear about that, no fear, you know the standard double I wish my wife and my sweetheart could be friends. And when we going on a date, me and bring both of them.
