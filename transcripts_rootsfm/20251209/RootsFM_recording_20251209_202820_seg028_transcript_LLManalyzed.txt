Far, far away And she left me alone Said she's going to stay From day to day say see you flop up on me say see you go flip with the little shorts and see you catch up on the rips like see y'all forget about the royalness a friend and company see you follow me get the tip Yo, round about she just a jump she just a skip Say what I'm put the others where you know you used to keep Say what I put the king where you used to be with Yo, well me Mrs. Senator Anne, a loyal citizen. Far, far away. And she left me alone.
