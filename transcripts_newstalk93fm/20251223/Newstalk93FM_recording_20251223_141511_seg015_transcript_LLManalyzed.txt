20251223 141511 This is the piece that you cannot buy. Send me love that you cannot mix. One is the joy that you you cannot waste And the other one price that you cannot fix This is the peace that you cannot buy Find it a way where you cannot see Mind with this cyst if you cannot breathe I need to find relief But behind my mind it runs All these thoughts have trouble me Find it to give up my bed baby. Finding to be on my land, my mind. Running to the other side, when it's time to leave my life. Then it tries to take me out, tell you what I need. Right, yeah, I really need, I really need money.
