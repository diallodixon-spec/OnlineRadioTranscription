There's a big medical word called idiopathic. So the listeners of Nationwide, some people would have been exposed to that word before, George, for those who haven't. It just simply means we don't know the meaning. Medicine loves to ascribe very big words to different things, but it just simply means idiopathic, we don't know. So that's a word that allows us to get away with not knowing, right? Yes. But secondary and then idiopathic and primary are words that are used together. So primary causes idiopathic. Secondary means secondary to something else. Yes. So secondary to something else yes so secondary to something else and this is why Charmaine is having a secondary cause because her leg cramps is secondary to a complication from her diabetes yes which is peripheral arterial disease and peripheral neuropathy
