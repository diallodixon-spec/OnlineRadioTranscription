20251223 180103 You have to visit my grandfather up at Sangster Heights this Christmas. He voted for you last time I checked, so you need to go check him out. I don't want to load that up on air, but I'll send you the address. Have a good afternoon, Minister. Thank you very much, guys, and thanks to everybody who has assisted us in being so successful this year. Thank you. The headlines are next.
