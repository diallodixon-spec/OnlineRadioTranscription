It's a little taboo. The whole business about debt recovery is an important thing for us to understand as entrepreneurs, understand how it is that is managed, and understand first of all that it don't necessarily mean that you're a bad person or necessarily a bad business person as well. Exigent circumstances can cause death to incur and sometimes to mount. Raising awareness that death is often sometimes a result of systemic factors and not necessarily personal failures and so on is very very, very key to understanding and the life of an entrepreneur. So what we're saying is that the whole business of when you, if and when, you don't set up your business to get in debt. We don't do that.
