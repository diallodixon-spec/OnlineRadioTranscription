Oh Lord, why are you putting me into trouble? I would say everybody have a unique value to this business and all of us, we are all special in our own right. Now, I can speak on behalf of my company and let you know that we are into the personal touch. So we are there with you. We pick you up at the resort. If you're on the raft, we're there with you. If you're jumping off the cliff, we're there you. If you are on the boat with the catamaran, we are swimming with you. So you're kinda like getting, not a driver situation where we drop you off and let you go and enjoy yourself. But we partake and that will enhance, that ultimately enhances the experience. And then now you move from being our client to family. Wow, yes.
