============================================================

I can't forget when I'm in love anymore I can't forget things will never be the same again I can't forget how you made that so clear I can't forget it now Every time you're near Every time I see your smile Hear your hello Saying you can only stay awhile How will I know that it's hard for you To say the things we both know are true But down at park all night, can't forget We're not in love anymore
