Imagine, imagine, imagine, imagine. You think you coulda get in all my feelings You coulda get me if you settle down Miggi I hit and run Miggi, I hit and run Me did only one little dealin' Nobody did a look, you must sit down Miggi, you hit and run. I'm down in one little dealin'. Love, I did a look, I must sit down. I get a hit-and-run. I get hit and run. Hey, my youth, you take it to zero. Yes, just a little. Now you take a set-up on me. I eat up, give me space, give me room, give me love.
