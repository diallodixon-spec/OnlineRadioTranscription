Some of them have lost roofs, have lost their damage to their farms, but they are ready and raring to go. So, I mean, thank you so much. One of the things I want you and the team at BPM to do is to seriously consider getting my people into the investment business because they're into savings which can't earn them money. So are you committing to making people understand the need to save a little so they can invest a lot over time? Definitely, most definitely. BPM Financial Limited is a leader in financial literacy and we want to take financial literacy to every corner of Jamaica.
