It's just the resilience of the Jamaican people and the farmers themselves, you know. You know, when we were out there in the field, we met a woman farmer and we were asking her about some of the challenges that she has and i'm telling you that you would be so impressed it would sound as if she would do a better job than any any of her male counterparts so those were moments that actually stood out with us and we are very proud of the initiative that we have
