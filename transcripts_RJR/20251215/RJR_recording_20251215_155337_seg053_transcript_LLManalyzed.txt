You often say ministry is about service, not performance. What do you mean when you say that? Because if you love the Lord, you're going to service people. Some people would just do it because we want to show that we're so anointed or we can do the miracles and the stuff. But when you love God and when you do ministry, you show that you love his people. You want to see his grace. You want to his power be manifested. So for me, it's not a performing thing. I want to see real transformation. I want to people really change their life. I want to real change. So it can't be performance for me because I'm going to forget about me. I'm not going to big up myself, but I'm going to always let Christ be seen in me. That's very important, Minister Hanson. And tell you why, because there's so many ministers and preachers around.
