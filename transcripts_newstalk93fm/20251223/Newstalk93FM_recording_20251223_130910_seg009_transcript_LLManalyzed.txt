20251223 130910 And I've been waiting Call me stop But I can't get over it You left and never Say goodbye Those tears I cried No, I can't over it So don't you ever Let me down again Cause I'm depending on you So you better come through this time Please hear my cry and if I ever Let you down my friend It was people buy new drugs Emotions running high
