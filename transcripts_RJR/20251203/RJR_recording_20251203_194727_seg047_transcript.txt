During Hurricane Melissa, more than 760 of the National Water Commission systems were damaged. In addition to repairs being needed for some NWC infrastructure, many of their systems rely on electricity. Other factors such as blocked intakes, landslides, and limited access to some facilities have slowed restoration. Unfortunately, some of these factors have impacted water supply in parishes not badly affected by the hurricane. The OUR is receiving regular updates from the NWC, and we note the steady progress in restoring water to various areas in each parish. But you need to know when you will get back water. Here's what you can do. Contact NWC by calling 888-CALL-NWC. That is 888-225-5692.
