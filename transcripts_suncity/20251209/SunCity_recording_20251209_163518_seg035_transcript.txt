Yes, me have a question Me have a question, I search for the answer Me have a question Yes me have a question, Me have a question You go fast, you go pray You go study Bible night and day From the Sabbath till you're not straight And so you pull an answer anyway Oh you a go show God you love him You a go reach up to the sky and hug him Make a lot of money and give him We show him by the way we live in. Oh, you're gonna kill a man just who you feel like. And the way they move make them so right. You hear the music, it nice to rock it. You touch the prophet or you touch God anointed. And on me or God, they might fight with. Against God, none of them the right hand. Oh, you are gonna show God you love him. You're gonna reach up into the sky and hug him. Make a lot of money.
