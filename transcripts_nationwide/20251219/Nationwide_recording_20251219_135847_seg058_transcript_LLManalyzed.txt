20251219 135847 I'll hold on until now I need you right now Once I leave you I'm strung out If I get you I'm slowly breaking down And oh it's hard to see you but I wish you were right here Oh it's hard to leave you when I get you everywhere Oh this time I'm thinking we could never be a pair Oh no I I don't need you, but I miss you, come here And oh, it's hard to see you but I miss you over here Oh, it's hard leave you when I get you everywhere Oh, this time I'm thinking I'm strong enough to sink it Oh no, don't need you, but I miss you, come here It can't be said, I'm in world at work It's ten o'clock before I say a word Baby, I can never tell How do you sleep so well? You keep telling me
