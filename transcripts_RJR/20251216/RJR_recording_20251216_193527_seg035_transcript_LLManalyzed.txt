This is a powerful demonstration of partnership, purpose and shared national responsibilities. This gift is an opportunity. LIGHT represents more to these 10 schools now. It is access, it is communication, it is being able to even print a page to send home for a student to revise. It's Vaughn. And Twyla. And we're here with what you need to know this week week. For the wife. Hey Twyla, I want to start off the show with a very special big up to an individual who truly deserves some special honour. No sir, this looks serious. Vaughn didn't even start the show with him usual car and I enjoyed him. Plenty of times he left it on the show for that man, don't worry about that, everything good. Anyway.
