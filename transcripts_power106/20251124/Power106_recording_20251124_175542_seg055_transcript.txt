============================================================

Come hold me tight Oh, let's dance, romance While we still have the chance Come on, come on Rock me, rock me, rock me baby Rock me out here on the floor Rock me, rock me, rock me baby Rock me till I want no more There's a feeling of love deep inside me This heart of mine is pounding in my brain. I feel the fire. I feel desire. Oh, let's dance, romance while we dance.
