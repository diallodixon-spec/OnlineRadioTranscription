2025-12-12 13:29:24 What would you do if I brought you up here on this day? What would you do? Tell me, what would you do? The lights are down. The mood is set. The sound is right. I'm here. Look to my left and check my crowd. Look to my right to see if they are ready now. Bye. Tell me who are they? Feels like last night. Wants me to take them shopping and buy them everything. Southern City. Where do you live? With a difference. I choose you. With a difference. Now what would you do if I said all of these words were true? What would you do? If I came down here and said we'd break it down? What would you do if I told a man to break it down? If I said I wanna lay you down, what would you if I put this money in your hand?
