20260101 173518 I put your picture on my mirror. Start to blush when somebody says your name. In my stomach's a pain See you walk in my direction I go the other way I start to stutter when I speak Try to stand but my knees go weak What's happening to me? In the dark can you tell me what it means? I lay my head on my pillow staring out the window
