The way how you move, it got me feeling you feel it, feel it, feel, it, feel it? Baby, tell me, can you feel, feel, it? Let me know when you are feeling it, feeling it, feeling, feeling. Baby, let me know when you're feeling it. Is this a dream? Am I awake? Moon on your skin? Hands round your waist?
