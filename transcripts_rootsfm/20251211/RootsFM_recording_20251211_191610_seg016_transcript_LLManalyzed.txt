2025-12-12 05:26:29 please lady please lady don't just walk away because i have this need to tell you why i'm all alone today i can see so much of me still living in your eyes won't you share a part of a weary heart that has lived a million lies? Oh, I've been to Nice and the Isle of Greece while I sipped champagne on a yacht. I moved like Harlow in Monte Carlo and showed him what I've got. I've been undressed by kings And I've seen some things that a woman ain't supposed to see I've been to paradise, but I've never been to hell
