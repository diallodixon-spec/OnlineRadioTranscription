Or you could ask the title office, they could just put a note on it to say it is lost. And you're going to be doing a lost title application. But act quickly. Because you don't want anybody to try to use that to do something. Because we are living in strange times. Oh boy. So in that case, what would, I mean, my being the legitimate owner, what recourse would I have if something like that occurred? Well, they can't pass what is not theirs and it's just an inconvenience to go to court and to get it back. Because you would get it back because the person can't say what is not theirs, but then when they have transferred it to a legitimate owner. Well, not legitimate in question. Recall that person have bona fide approaches of a body. They don't know that it's not theirs. Right, right. You know, then you have to go to court to say, hey, this person, I did not sell it legit. You know, it's costing a few millions to go to the Supreme Court.
