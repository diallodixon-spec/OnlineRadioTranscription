============================================================

Welcome on board the drive, drive time family. Good to have you tuned in with us this afternoon. You know, I say kick back, relax and enjoy the drive here on NCUF and baby talk comes away at 3.30 on a Wednesday afternoon. You can stay tuned with me as we drive together right until 6.30. Good to have you tuned in, kick back, relax and enjoy the drive. This Christmas, Benjamin's is bringing the flavor and the prizes!
