20251215 103830 the driver alone operated the bus. I have no idea if this was a norm but I've seen other buses all over the place when I'm driving across the island and I would see more than one person operating but I don't know what's going on in Portland, the stretch from St. Mary into Bus Bay. Not sure what caused on this particular day only one person. There should be a law in place where that does not move just like the airline. You're not going to send off a flight with just a pilot. There must be a co-pilot just in case there is an emergency with the pilot. I believe the same thing should apply with the buses. You cannot operate these buses without a driver and in the old times they used to say a conductor. Right now I think they use the word supervisor. So that's another thing that I believe was breached.
