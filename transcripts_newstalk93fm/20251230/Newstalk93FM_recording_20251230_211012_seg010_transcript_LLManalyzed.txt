20251230 211012 I just need some solitude, oh gosh But everybody's trying to talk to me and nobody's trying to hear me out So you've got some things to say, honestly, you just all move your mouth The things you say, it makes no sense, I'm in out of time to figure it out Leave me alone, it's best you just leave me So much pain To see that you don't see. It's driving me insane. Leave me alone now. Oh, yes. Yo, right here now, no for them to get block and delete. You're playing mode all the life, you're so sweet. Come and ring off me line, seven days at the week. Oh, me nothing right now, me nothing sweet.
