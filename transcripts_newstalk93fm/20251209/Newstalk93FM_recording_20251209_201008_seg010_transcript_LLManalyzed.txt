============================================================

I'm feeling so blessed, oh yes happy before Hands up high I'm whining low I'm glad you're go I don't want you no more Walk out the gate All of the good you create Like I start to live it Walk out the gate No debate Life gets straight and great Like you was the weight So flood I procrastinate Look on my right and amputate I remember the date Not cause I hate Guess hate Guess I stayed in the latter state The day you leave me, the day you leave me I started to see my way, when you hurt me And went away, what I thought was a tragedy
