20251226 155337 Sweet silly things As if my mind is unsung and I I wanna be closer So much closer I wanna be closer, so much closer Closer to you So much, so much I wanna be sweeter Sweet I wanna be so much sweeter I I wanna be sweeter, sweeter to you.

And I don't know what makes me feel this way I just weep silly things as if my mind is unsolved And I wanna be closer So I wanna be closer
