What's going on there? Go figure it when we got my DJs. DJs around the shelf are gonna make your bust too pew-pew with the maddest, baddest, and latest tunes. So look out for Outside with Pepita. We might be coming to a town near you. You heard it here first. Outside with Pepita, Saturdays 3-5pm on Nationwide 90FM. The new revolution in media. Jamaica, Locketeen and Dome is a thing.
