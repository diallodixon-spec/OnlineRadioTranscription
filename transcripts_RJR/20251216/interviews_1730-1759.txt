**Court of Appeal Ruling Sparks Debate on Judicial Intervention**

A recent Court of Appeal ruling in Jamaica has sparked a heated debate on the role of judges in the country's adversarial justice system. The ruling, which quashed a murder conviction due to excessive intervention by the trial judge, has raised questions about the limits of judicial power and the potential for bias.

According to Adlai Duncan, a former Deputy Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) and current Senior Crown Counsel in Bermuda, the judge's role is to ensure fairness and impartiality in the proceedings. "The judge plays a sort of umpire role and just ensures fairness of the whole proceedings," Duncan explained. However, in the case of Conroy Stevenson, the trial judge's robust questioning of a key witness was deemed to have undermined the witness's credibility and potentially influenced the jury's decision.

CJ Mitchell, a Senior Counsel who represented Stevenson, argued that the judge's questioning was objectionable because it amounted to cross-examination, which is the role of the prosecution. "The judge is supposed to be a referee and an umpire, as it were," Mitchell said. "When the judge takes over and asks questions, it's like the judge is taking over the role of the prosecutor."

The debate has also raised questions about the potential for bias among judges, many of whom are former prosecutors. Bart Samuels, a Senior Counsel, noted that 90% of Jamaica's judges were former prosecutors, which could create a perception of bias. However, Duncan countered that this was a "specious argument" and that bias was not the central issue in the appeal.

The Court of Appeal's ruling has been commended for its independence and fearlessness in criticizing the Chief Justice's actions. As Mitchell noted, "The Court of Appeal was able to write this judgment, and they put it that it was the Chief Justice, and I commend my Court of Appeal for their independence and fearless writing of this judgment."

The case has sparked a wider debate about the desirability of judge-alone trials and the potential for judicial intervention to influence the outcome of cases. As Duncan noted, "The appeal spoke about the fairness of the trial and how the robust questioning impacted perceptions on the fairness of the trial." The ruling has significant implications for the Jamaican justice system and highlights the need for judges to exercise caution and restraint in their questioning of witnesses.

In a surprising twist, the case has also raised questions about the potential for judges to be influenced by their own experiences and biases. As Samuels noted, "The judge interacts with the police in a different way than the average Jamaican, and that can create a perception of bias." The debate is likely to continue, with many calling for greater transparency and accountability in the justice system.

As the legal community continues to grapple with the implications of the ruling, one thing is clear: the case of Conroy Stevenson has sparked a vital debate about the role of judges in Jamaica's justice system and the need for fairness, impartiality, and transparency in the pursuit of justice.
