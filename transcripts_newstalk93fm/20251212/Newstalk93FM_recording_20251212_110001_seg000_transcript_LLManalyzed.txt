20251212 110001 Open praise, you know, cause we like main A toothbrush to the brain I know me can't take it out for a stain So me know say you a feel it, feel it, feel, it, feel it So me know, say you a feel, feel, feel it Is this a dream? Am I awake? Moon on your skin Hands round your waist Music is love And I hear tuna play The way how you're moving Got me feeling awake, awake, awake A way, a way In life In life Like royalty, royalty If I ever make it in a life Make it in a life
