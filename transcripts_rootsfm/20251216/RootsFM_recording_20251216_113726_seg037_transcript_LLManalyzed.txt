What is going to be happening on that? It's important. That's why we want to raise the maximum funds from this concert to bring down social workers, go to these communities, work hand in hand with them. We already have spoken to with the Ministry of Health. As soon as we bring them down there, we're going to have the proper permits, and we're going to be working hand in hand, see what the people need. Sometimes it's easy to say, oh, let me just give you what I want to give you. want to hear what you need what are your needs yeah what yeah what's what the community needs and that's what we want to respond to and excellent that's why lightjamaica.com that's where you can get the tickets it's so important such an important event
