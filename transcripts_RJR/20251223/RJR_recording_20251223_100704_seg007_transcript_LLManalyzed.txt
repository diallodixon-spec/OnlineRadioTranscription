20251223 100704 Hello, good morning, Mr. Mulling. Good morning, welcome. Yes, how are you? I'm good, thanks. What's happening? All right, I want to discuss a matter that I understand has been... It's really a travesty when you look at it. It is the George Williams case that was heard in the Supreme Court in June by Justice Winslayer and awarded that $120 million. Oh, the man was in custody for many years, wasn't it? Yes, for 50 years or more, yes. Yes, okay. And the government is appealing the award and what I understand is that an appeal doesn't necessarily stay an award in court unless it is that that is also an order which you are requesting in the appeal. And the government is offering six million.
