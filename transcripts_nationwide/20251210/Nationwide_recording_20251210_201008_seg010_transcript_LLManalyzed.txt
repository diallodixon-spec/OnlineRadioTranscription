So the older you get as a man, obviously you have to create foundation and you're starting to create a family for yourself. So my mother will always be my mother. But now I have somebody that I'm trying to have a good relationship I don't like that I feel in a relationship there should be a line and there's like if you want to tell your mother say all right boy mommy you know say me and Phillip have a problem cool don't go into detail now and tell about it however it does put a strain on the relationship I think it's's always easier when you understand they get along because then there's those awkward pickups and those awkward silences. How did you never get through that though? I just never go to the house too much. Avoid, avoid.
