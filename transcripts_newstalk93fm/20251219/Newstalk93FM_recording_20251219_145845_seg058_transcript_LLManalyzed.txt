With more rooms available, increased flights arriving, and workers receiving support to rebuild, the tourism industry is rapidly recovering. In our No Jamaica segment, Dolphin Cove. Dolphin Cove is one of Jamaica's top marine attractions, where visitors can swim with dolphins and interact with other sea creatures in their natural environment. The park offers thrilling activities like glass-bottom kayaking, snorkeling with stingrays, mini-boat rides, and even swimming with and feeding sharks. With options ranging from gentle dolphin touch encounters to the immersive dolphin trek, it's a must-visit for anyone wanting to explore the island's vibrant marine life. That's it for this week's Tourism Roundup. I'm André Palma with studio engineer Andrés Soyas. One Love.
