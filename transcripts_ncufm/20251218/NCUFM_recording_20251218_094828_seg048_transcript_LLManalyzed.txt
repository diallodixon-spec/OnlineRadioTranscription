Today, Chimamanda is celebrated worldwide. But her journey began with migration, with leaving home, facing misunderstanding, and choosing to speak. Her story reminds us that migration is not about movement, it's about transformation. She carried Nigeria to America, and America back into Nigeria. She carried her family's hopes, her culture's richness, and her own determination. And in so doing, she became a voice for millions who have crossed borders with dreams in their hearts. Chimamanda's migration story teaches us this. When we move, we carry more than our belongings. We carry with us our stories. Migration may strip us of comfort.
