20251217 201819 I guess it's just to wish you a Merry Christmas. My best friend's having a party, and everybody's going. I know it's gonna be a lot of fun. Oh, by the way, it's snowing. It's been a long, long time, and it's late. Rockin' around the Christmas tree at the Christmas party hop. Whistled all the way, you can't see every couple tries to stop.
