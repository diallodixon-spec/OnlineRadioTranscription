Of course I would shake hands. And Dr. Peter Phillips? Of course. And the shadow cabinet members were with placards? Of course, of course. And in fact I saw some of them like about two or three weeks after the election and I shoot them and I talk to them. I'm just that type of person. I don't believe, I think when you hold a grudge, it ages you. And I don't want to age anytime soon. I understand.
