20251226 173021 This is a serious time, violence and crime and up here gunting the youths and my body and mind. They bust it when rain or fall, you know see, they don't care, they're youths. They bust it all when sun or shine. You don't see, you don't see your pain juvenile My life begins on the street Where did they get it from? Nobody knows, their father was a killer When I saved that girl I know I can't sleep No matter what I try to do I can't sleep
