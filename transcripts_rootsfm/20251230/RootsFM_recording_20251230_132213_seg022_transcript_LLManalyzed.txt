20251230 132213 So why should I be afraid of you? When you bleed just like I do The more you try to fight Judge your life keeps shining through So I've got no time for you Cause in my view you wanna step in on my shoe You wish you never live alone Feel so damn confused How every day you wake you ache Because you know you're fake And every step you take I bring you closer to your grave But I am like a column when I easily shake Me certain say I fit me none of who no can't take Here we go.
