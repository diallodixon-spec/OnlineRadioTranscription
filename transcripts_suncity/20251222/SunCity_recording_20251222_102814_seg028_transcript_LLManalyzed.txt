20251222 102814 we like to glorify and put out there for our population to know that. But track and field just did not stop when new symbol came on the scene, but we've had some very great persons represent Jamaica over the years, and let's not forget them. That is so true. Thank you so much, Mr. Claire, for sharing with us this morning. And thank you so much for all the contribution that you have made to Jamaica over the decades. When you say 34, 32 years since Team Jamaica Bickel has been going, that is a long time to be supporting the youth here in Jamaica. And we really appreciate it. Thank you so much for making the time here on Hello Jamaica. And all the best and do not be a stranger. All right. And thank you for having me. And I just want to say on behalf of Team Jamaica, we wish all Jamaica Merry Christmas, a prosperous new year. We are part of this. We will continue to be part of the solution and the bill forward. All right. Thank you so much. All right.
