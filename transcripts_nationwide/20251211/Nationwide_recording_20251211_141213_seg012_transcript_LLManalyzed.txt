But you made me feel Yeah, you made me feel Shiny and new Like a virgin Touched for the very first time Like a virgin When your heart beats Next to mine Gonna give you all my love, boy My fear is great and fearless Been saving it all for you Cause only love can last You're so, and you're mine Make me stop, now you make me fall, fall, fall Bad girl, bad girl Talkin' bout the sad girl, sad girl The sad girl, the sad girl
