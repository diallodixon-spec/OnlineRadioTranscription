I don't understand You look just like the man In the picture by our bed The suspense is pounding and clouding up my head I'm checking your clothes and you wear the same size shoes you're sleeping in a spot and you're driving a car but I don't know just who you are there's a stranger in my house it took a while to make your eyes There's no way you could be who you say you are You gotta be someone else Cause he wouldn't touch me like that And he wouldn't treat me like you
