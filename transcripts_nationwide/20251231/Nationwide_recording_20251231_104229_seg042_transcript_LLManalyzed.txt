20251231 104229 I'm coming home to run. I'm coming home. To get into politics because I enjoy it. Okay. So, you have declared right here nationwide. I hear you. But anyway, my sister thinks I'm crazy because I'm always talking to my family. Yes. Merry Christmas to everybody. I love you guys. What do you want me to do? Enjoy your family. No, listen, she already told me that she doesn't cook and she never sleeps. So, I don't know who she cooks because she knows that I cook like her. Well, I love all of you guys. I just want you guys to meet my sister. Yes. She has a restaurant in Maryland. So, she is there. Oh, good. A Jamaican restaurant, sis.
