We say good afternoon to you. Thank you so much for making it your middle station. Of course, my choice. I gotta say good afternoon to the Brook Valley crew. They came out over the weekend. The funeral service of my brother, Nevada Blair, no longer with us physically, but spiritually, he is. So Brook Valley, good afternoon. I've got to say good afternoon to the member of parliament, also, Mr. Hilton. Thank you so much for turning out.
