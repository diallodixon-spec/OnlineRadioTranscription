20251217 193227 Sorry, you just broke up. Were you asking me something? Yes, I was asking you about the race to recovery now. Well, Motorsport became humanitarian. Paul, I want to get into that, please. For sure. For sure. So at the end of the season, obviously, like I mentioned before, Jamaica, we just had, I mean had a devastating hurricane. And Uncle Chris and I decided that we were going to use our car as a platform to try and get as much European donations and people who knew us in Europe to basically give back and help rebuild the country. So with that on the car and with with us winning I think we got some good publicity for it and I think we raised over a million dollars Jamaican which was great and one of the positives of the season I mean winning the European Championship was one thing but that was also something that meant a lot to us
