20251223 204331 I have a lining spirit Early in the morning I hat it Me cooler ready, me ice done ready Me punching that's automatic I have a lining jumbie A kind of energy inside me And it ready for the rum Ready, ready for the rum, ready, ready for rum Ready for the action, a spiritual encounter Clean me soul taking over Telling me to start up the drinking Can do away with good behaviour So we out on the road now It's Mars and Rudy Mansoaker And they're ready for the rum, ready, ready for the rum Ready, ready, ready cool already, me heist done ready, me punch in that shit.
