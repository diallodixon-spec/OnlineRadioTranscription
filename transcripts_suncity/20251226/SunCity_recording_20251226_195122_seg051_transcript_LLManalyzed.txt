20251226 195122 I am the king of representation, you don't know, right? Oh Lord, we give you praise. You are in charge of it. Oh Lord, we love you praise. So come on in. It's time again. Christmas time again. All we do when it's Christmas, frisbee, Frisbee. So hallelujah. Frisbee frisbee. We are the sunset in the sun. Sun up, sun up, sun up. We are reflected in the sun.
