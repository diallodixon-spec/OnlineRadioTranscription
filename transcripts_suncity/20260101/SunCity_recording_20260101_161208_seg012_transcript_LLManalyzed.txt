20260101 161208 and number 13 party princesses at 99 to 1. It's a rainy day at the track. I can tell you though, these are very slow horses. They're lucky to get a trophy. I mean, the slowest of the slow you can find. So in terms of reliability, very unreliable this group. They'll come today and run a decent race and not run another decent race for another three, four, five months. But, having done my homework on this one, I think it's between Select Splendid Vision and Lion of Ikati. If they run back to their last few runs, they should at least have a lot on this field. Three, four, five lengths of Splendid Vision, number five, and number 12, Lion of Ikati, the favorite. The winner should come should come from these two but again certainty level on this one is about 30% but if I had if I was gonna bet I would bet one of those two number 5 is currently going off at odds of 6 to 1
