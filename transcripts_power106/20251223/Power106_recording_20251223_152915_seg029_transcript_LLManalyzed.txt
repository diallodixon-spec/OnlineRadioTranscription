20251223 152915 I almost wrecked my car right there, a truck. I was going in the right lane. I was in the left lane and I saw a trailer empty. What do you call them? The one with nothing, the low boys. And I was going there, it was going a good speed, like 80 kilometer, because I think it's 80 kilometer right there. I slowed down because I knew it was going to happen. It almost flipped over. That's just negligent. And this is the thing that I'm talking about. It's not often the thing about money, it's not often about being poor, it's absolutely negligent, don't care. I don't care. And this is sometimes my heart goes, my heart bleeds. So I don't care, I don't care. And sometimes my heart goes, my heart bleeds. I don't care, I don't care what happened. The same thing happened at the police station, coming into Mobi at Tarle Gardens, because that's where I'm at.
