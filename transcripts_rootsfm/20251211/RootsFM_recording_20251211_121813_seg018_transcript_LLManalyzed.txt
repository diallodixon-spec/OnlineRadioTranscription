I understand. Did the Lord tell Peter? I knew you were just a weak man. No. An excuse is an escape route. What did the Lord ask Peter? He did not ask him. Are you sorry? The Lord only asked Peter one thing do you love me forgiveness loves unfortunately excuses just covers up an amnesty can be an excuse but it is not necessarily forgiveness. An excuse is a feel sorry thing and forgiveness is I am sorry.
