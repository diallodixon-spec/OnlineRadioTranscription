Yeah, man. Big up yourself, Chris, over there in Atlanta. Chris, which KFC is your favorite KFC? The KFC in Atlanta? Or the KFC in Jamaica? Or wherever else you've been to where you've had KFC? Which one is the best? Regardless, Jamaicans, we love, love, love our KFC. So the folks at KFC continue to do an awesome job. Whatever you're doing is working. I just ask one thing of y'all. Just one thing more to do. You see the KFC that's in Montego Bay? to me I think that's the biggest KFC. We need some bigger KFCs. I think there are way way too much small KFCs. We just need some KFCs.
