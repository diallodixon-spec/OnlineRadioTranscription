Yo, you're listening to Roots FM 96.1. When all the money that they rob from ghetto youths ain't enough to fly you to Mars When the system you defend start break down like a Lego When the whole world becomes a ghetto That's when you realize The world how we a ghetto people So tell, suppose the slave don't forget the people. Ghetto people. Call them all. Remember highly, see last he never left the people. No time at all, no keeping the slaves.
