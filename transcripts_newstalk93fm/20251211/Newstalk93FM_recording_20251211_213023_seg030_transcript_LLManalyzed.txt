2025-12-12 15:48:47 I don't come, I don't come kilometers I don't walk that many kilometers Learn from the teacher I don't take for the game, she no pitas I decide bad Send them back to where they come from For talking like the product of a torn condom South Side will come from in a care, my brother One side sit down for one chair, me brother Come try me, we'll make you disappear, me brother Long time it takes to reach, hear me, brother Killing me, killing me, killing me
