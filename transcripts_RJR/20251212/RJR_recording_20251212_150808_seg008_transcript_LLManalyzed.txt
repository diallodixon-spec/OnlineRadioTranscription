20251212 150808 This is 94.5 Turned to darkness Under her spell she had me crushed I swore I wasn't haunted Like art in your madness She had me fooled for a while With her sexual emotions Like taking candy from a child Stuck on her love potion I can't believe the changes she's made, like warping cheap clothing. She drives me crazy. She's having my baby, she goes.
