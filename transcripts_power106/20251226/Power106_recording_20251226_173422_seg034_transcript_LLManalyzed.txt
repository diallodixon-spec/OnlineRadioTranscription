I will be there when you need me I will be there, when you're crying baby I will be there where you need someone to tell you That you're beautiful, baby I will be that when you need someone to run away I will be there When you need someone to dance away. I will be there When you need someone to dance with. From your lover to the sky you stand great girl. Cause you're beautiful baby. It's you're beautiful, oh you're beautiful, it's you're beautiful.
