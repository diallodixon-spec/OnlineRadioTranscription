at the National Stadium, where they kicked off at 7 o'clock in the second leg of the Cup final against Universidad O&M. At sports time, Mount Pleasant entered the contest holding a 1-0 aggregate lead, following last Tuesday's victory in Santiago. The Santander-based team needs only a draw tonight to secure the title. A win or draw would deliver Mount Pleasant's second professional trophy, adding to their 2023 Jamaica Premier League triumph. It will also make them just the second Dominican club of the Caballero Soccer Club to win the Caribbean Cup and place them alongside former regional champions Harvard, U.N., and Porto United from the Caribbean Club Championship era. There will be new champions in the Inter-Secondary School Sports Association, the Costa Cup. Gabby Marcello was knocked out of the competition after a 5-2 defeat to Glenn Muir in the round of 16 showdown in May 10 earlier today.
