20251229 194632 When we both can make it work when I'm gonna make you nervous if you hurt me I deserve You start loving me, I know But even chaos serves a purpose It feels good to love somebody And somebody loves you back So don't give in to your dreams, boy Cause I'll be here for a lifetime You don't have to pretend to bow Because it's Christmas with Nana Guess it's bye to the good times And I'll be gone by the sunrise I'll be back down on my own Nobody should call my phone, nobody should call my phone This is my last heartbreak song
