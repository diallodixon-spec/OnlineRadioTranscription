And now the news in detail, we begin with local news. Energy Minister Daryl Vaz is standing firmly behind the government's decision to offer a loan to the Jamaica Public Service,PS following sharp criticism from opposition MPs. Speaking at Wednesday's post-cabinet briefing, Vaz dismissed the backlash as crocodile tears and a dry cry, accusing opposition members of insincerity after publicly attacking the move. He says the loan is essential to speed up post-Hurricane Melissa restoration, noting that 82% of JPS customers are already back on the grid. Vaz argues the loan is a better option than extending JPS's license and insists he has no regrets.
