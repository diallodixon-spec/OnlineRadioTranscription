20251231 093535 I got a message here on Instagram from one of our listeners seeking assistance from the Redwood community in St Catherine. And she says the community received electricity on November 8th. However, her road hasn't received electricity due to a downed pole. On Friday, someone from JPS contacted them inquiring if the pole was restored. He later told them a maintenance team was assigned to the site and the pole should be restored later in the night.
