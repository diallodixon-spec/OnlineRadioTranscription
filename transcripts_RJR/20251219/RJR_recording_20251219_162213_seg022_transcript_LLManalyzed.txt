20251219 162213 I can't talk enough about that woman. Can I tell you? All right, what message would you like to leave with the listeners today, Brian? Well, for this season, we generally think about balance. Yes. So while people are thinking about uplifting themselves, then we also encourage them to include give back in that period. So uplifting yourself, but also uplift others. So we encourage everyone to come out, donate, and help to rebuild our communities. It is important. All of us live here in this country, you know. Definitely. We have to protect our economy. We live in it. Correct. We are feeling the effects. Correct. Let's build it. A greater Jamaica is a greater Jamaica for all, not just one. No man is an island, and so we have to help each other. Thank you so much for speaking with us this afternoon. Thank you for having me as well earlier. Have a wonderful rest of the evening. You too, Brian Henry, senior investment advisor, Barita Investments Limited.
