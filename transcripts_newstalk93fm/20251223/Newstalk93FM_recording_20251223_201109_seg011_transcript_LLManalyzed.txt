20251223 201109 I feel your frequency from miles away. You come alive with one wine, baby. With you I want to dance the night away. One jam to a lifetime, baby. So don't feel away. You don't like the fast life. But look on the bright side, girl. I go take the blame. I just want you to come and bite it up. Just a little winding up. Come and meet me in the truck and we rev it up. All day, keep throwing it back at the way you like it.
