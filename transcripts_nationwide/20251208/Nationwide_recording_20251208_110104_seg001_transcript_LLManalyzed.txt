I could even hear heaven saying son you're that serious and I lay down in the sand waiting to die and I fell asleep without medication and I woke up in the morning and I was still alive and I cried I cried what I'm going to do now to get this fever to leave me alone? Right? And I took my suitcase that I had and I went back to the main road. And as I put my first feet on the tar, I started vomiting. The gramazone came out back. I went to live under a tree. I'm just talking about 2021. I went to leave under a tree. They woke me in the night. They phoned me to death. I never left. They woke me again by fire.
