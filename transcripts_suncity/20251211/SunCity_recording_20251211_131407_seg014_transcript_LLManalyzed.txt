============================================================

As soon as we get started making love, going hard, I hear a knock, knock, knocking on the wall. And as soon as I go deep, getting in there again, there's a knock, knock knocking on the wall, girl, your legs keep shaking. I swear we breaking our new headboard, headboard. And the love we make, it feels so good, girl, you'm proud. Lookin' at your lovely face, scream my name. You do it so loud. I bet the neighbors know my name. The way you scream and scratch and yell and bet the n****s know my name. Maybe stressin' while we skip. I bet the neighborhoods know my name. My name, my name, my name. I bet the neighbors my name. My, my, my, my name. Take this pillow right here. Grab this. I know you're so excited. If you bite it, they will. And you know.
