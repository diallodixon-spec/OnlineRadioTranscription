20251230 150906 You pray for my demons girl, I got you Every time I sip on codeine, I get vulnerable Annoying the sounds of the storm when it comes She understand I can't take her everywhere I've been in the field like the children of the court I can hear your tears when they drop over the phone Get mad at yourself cause you can't leave me alone Toss up, get messy, that ain't what we doing Exactly what it is. Don't say it cause you know that's why I want to hear it.
