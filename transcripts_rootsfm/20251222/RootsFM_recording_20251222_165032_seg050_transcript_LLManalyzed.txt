20251222 165032 One of these days, we will meet again. Get ready for repatriation. One of these fine days we will meet again in peace and harmony. One of these days. We will meet again. One aim, one destiny. My yoke might be hard, but I promise to lighten my burden. Only injured do I trust, is the only solution to the system. And our freedom is a must, no matter how the hidden cause and force. Peace and love and unity is the key to continued survival. One of these fine days, we will meet again again You tell me you're in love with me Like you can take your prayers away from me It's not that I don't wanna stay
