============================================================

That time is now I'm done picking out the pieces No longer looking for the creases I've gotta save myself If not me, then who else? No longer walking in the shadows I've learned to love me more than anyone else And I will never be the same again. Making boundaries. I'm making boundaries. Walls so thick that you won't climb. Lines so long that you can't find my heart. Will never be something for anyone to trample on again Gotta protect me to the end Live my life with no regrets Blow the past I don't forget All the lessons I had to learn Sweets of flames and a fire burn
