20251225 150805 comfort for family protection while we sleep we pray for healing for prosperity we pray for your mighty hand to ease our suffering and all the while You hear each spoken need Yet love is way too much To give us lesser things Cause what if your blessings Come through raindrops? What if your healing comes through tears? What if a thousand sleepless nights? What it takes to know you're near?
