============================================================

Life has become a burden Living in this evil system Oh Jah, please transfer me I cannot make it alone I need you as my own Oh Jah, I call your name Some are trying to leave you out of your life But I wouldn't be so unwise And so I promised to serve thee with all my heart And I bet thee some mercy Lord, give me strength to face another day To make it a long life's road To carry your mind alone Give me strength to try to carry on
