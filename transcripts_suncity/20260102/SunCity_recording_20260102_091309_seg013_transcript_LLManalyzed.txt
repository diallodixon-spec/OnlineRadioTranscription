My career take off and so my career take off, I just start go back to some home and I just give back and you know, when people ask me for things, I'm just kind to them because I promise God. And I remember again when the one, the first song I'm having done already hit, you know, and know and people are saying you know how to find the next song and I go back again and I start praying again and I say god you can't make them laugh after me. I have to get the next song. And I pray and I pray and I look and I hear Maccabone and the whole place I march up again and I say thank you lord and you know so it's like me know say prior work and where you believe in and the faith and me, me say to God say, me want have a long jeopardy, jeopardy in all this business and when me look, me career is still here and me standing strong and no matter how the ups and the downs and me fall on me face, any time me just talk to the atmosphere and me fall up above, things just gone again for me.
