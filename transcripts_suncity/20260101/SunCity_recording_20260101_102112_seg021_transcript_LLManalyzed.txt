20260101 102112 I am still not completed. Hopes and fears. Watching them change into something new. Wondering if I'm going to find the answer. Loving you all of my life. It comes back to you and me running out of time I gotta find me a better understanding Every day you keep forgetting what's mine You gotta find me a way that's demanding And we're holding on so tight Together, all of our lives I'll see the clock up on the wall But if you don't bother me at all You'll never change your times
