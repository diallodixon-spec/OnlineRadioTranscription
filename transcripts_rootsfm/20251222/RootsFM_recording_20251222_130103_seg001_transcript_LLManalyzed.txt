20251222 130103 I don't want a lot for Christmas. There is just one thing I need. And I don't care about the presents. All you need is a Christmas tree. I don't need to end my stocking. Live upon the fireplace. Santa Claus won't make me happy. Oh All I want for Christmas is you. You, baby. Oh, I won't ask for much this Christmas. I won't even wish for snow. And I'm just gonna keep on waiting.
