20260102 174034 history as you have seen it over the years, how you see it in terms enough to recall that at the beginning of the 1970s, Jamaica had 200 murders per year. Throughout the 1980s, I believe we were somewhere between 450 and 650 if memory serves. I don't think there was any year in the 1980s where we went over 500 murders. In fact, it wasn't until 1990 that Jamaica saw 500 murders, putting away the 1980, which was that terrible election year.
