2025-12-12 11:56:19 anything is going to go. A city without boundaries is a city that is literally left to ruin. And I believe that when it comes to people's character and morals, those are what I would call the walls that maintain one's character. And we really have to get back to that kind of understanding where people actually value the things that are really important. And those are really the values and the morals that really help to add value to who we are or who we are supposed to be or who we're supposed to be as individuals. All right. I'll just quickly jump in here. I've had reference earlier in terms of your diet, what you consume on social media, et cetera, just to piggyback on what was said earlier in terms of your diet, what you consume on social media etc. Just to piggyback on what was said earlier in terms of persons getting brand deals based upon what they're seeing online etc. But I just want to make this point that there continues to be a tension between authenticity and algorithm visibility.
