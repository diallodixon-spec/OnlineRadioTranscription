20251225 104922 I'm just running low, not so near, so tall. Not so slow at night, everywhere we go. Why you singing carols right outside my door? All these things, whoa. All these things, oh. Hey, that's what Christmas means to me, my love. That's what Christmas means to me, my love. And you know what I mean. She's a smiling face, like I've never seen before. And though I love you madly, it seems I love you more. A little cultured gimmick will touch my heart for sure. Oh, all these things anymore. Oh, that's what Christmas means to me and my love.
