Good morning Dr. Taylor. I'd like to highlight the terrible conditions of Catherine Hall Montego Bay post-Melissa. Cleanup is slow and garbage is piling up and people still cleaning their houses after the flooding and the roads are covered with mud and they really need to be washed. Worse, when the rain falls the mud builds up more. We really need help. Really need help. On top of that, we need some serious intervention. JPS is not really reaching out to us to restore power. We need to see them being present.
