Defiling all the stock up on the shelf. I've been released, yet much of the east East I can only give a proof of myself Me me me sister no for man weak Man climb under no seat No hurt if you come here, come help You all are hungry, come from the heap Rise with the wheat, the condom I'm the black man, well take this We'll jump the vine, to the Empress right away Tell her to be fine, I don't want her to strain We'll dump the vine, to the woman right away, tell her to be mine
