There's so many Jamaicans and non-Jamaicans for that matter who want to come back to this world. But the crime situation is holding us back. I don't have to speak to the sp-off benefit that would come if we could get another half of it to Jamaican to live abroad, to come back to Jamaican to construct houses, to contribute to the economy.
