20251219 124132 at Devon House where you can get some services done while you shop and enjoy yourself. You can have a cafe, you get help with your cards, your expired cards, well, your credit cards, bank statements, anything. So come on by Devon House, mark it on the lawn. And I just want to give you a couple seconds just to appeal to everybody, listen. The deadline is December 31 at 12 noon and there is so much need. So do your part and make a wish for either yourself or somebody in need. And thank you to my crew at RGR 94 FM. Thanks for helping to get the message out. Thank you for much for speaking with us here today. And Dr. Taylor, I just have to say one thing. I just want to big up my team at NCB Foundation. They rock. They work behind the scenes to make sure this whole program works and I'm so grateful. Okay. Alright. God bless you.
