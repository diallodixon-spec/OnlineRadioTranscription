And the current president's term, Abdullah bin Ali al-Amri of Oman, his term expired, and Matthew Samouda, our energy or water environment and climate change minister, is now the new president of this group. We understand that all of that took place in the last 10 or so minutes. He was elected the president. There's a session now that's ongoing and they're supposed to have a press conference soon I hope to understand exactly what this thing is about yeah but I think that math is a movie
