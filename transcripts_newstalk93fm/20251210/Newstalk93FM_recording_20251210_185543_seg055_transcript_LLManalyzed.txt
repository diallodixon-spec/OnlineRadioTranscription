I coulda never take a loss, eh? Like a ball-pump, I'll be something fast. Fling out, this isn't for me. Work me, y'all, I won't make a fuzz out of ya. Original y'all, some of the party in a cow-pig-a-cow. And if you hear this on the gong, get your back. Gong, get your knees steady, shake it to the max. DJ, please turn up the bass to the max. Please just rewind, let me shake it to max. Shake it to the max, shake it to max, sh-sh rewind, check me, check me to the max. Caribbean girl, I know for tick, I know for tock. Man, I watch my can touch this. Baby, I am not a place and peace buddy, I put them down low. I feel bigger tears than the way I feel my past. And if you tell me something, go make your back, go make your knees, baby, shake it.
