20260101 124541 I make my home in your arms You see I live for you And nothing can compare To what we share We're in a world of our own So much love is there See baby you are my life To live without you I wouldn't try What would I be without you Let me make this toast to you You're what I celebrate You're like a never endingending holiday, you're my forever special occasion You're what I celebrate, you're like a never ending holiday You're my forever, special occasion
