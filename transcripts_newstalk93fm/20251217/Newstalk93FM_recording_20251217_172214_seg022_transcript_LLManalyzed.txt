20251217 172214 I'll be better on my own, I'll be better On my own, na, na Nobody should call my phone, nobody should call my phone Na, na This is my last heartbreak song, this is my last Heartbreak song I'll be good on my own, I'll be good all on my own Why are you so quick to leave When we both can make it worse When I'm gone I'll make you nervous If you hurt me I deserve it I've been acting foolishly Forgetting what you were You start loving me, I know this But even chaos serves a purpose It feels good to love somebody And somebody loves you back So don't give in to your chains, boy
