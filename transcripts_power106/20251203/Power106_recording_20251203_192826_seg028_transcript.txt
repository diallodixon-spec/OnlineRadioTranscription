Melissa is concerned, we are working very hard, and the outpouring of love that has come, the concern being shown by Jamaicans both here and abroad for the plight of those persons who were impacted so negatively is really, really extraordinary and is something that we cannot take right. Allo? Allo? Okay, all right. We have to go to a break in an event shortly. So let's go to the break here now and see if we can sort out our communications issues. The program is Power Play. We'll go to a break. Power 106 FM, the digital sound, now reaching you in more ways. Listen to us on 106.1 to 106.1.
