20251231 140303 You take my love for granted I just don't understand it I don't know how to talk to you I just know I find myself getting lost with you Lately you just made me work too hard for you Got me on flights overseas and I still can't get across to you And last night I think I lost my patience Last night I had expectations Last night, I think I lost my patience Last night, I, expectation Last night, I can't do a realization And I hope you can take it, I hope you could take it all I'm too good to you, I'm way too good to you You take my love for granted, I just don't understand And all I'm too good to you I'm waiting for someone else
