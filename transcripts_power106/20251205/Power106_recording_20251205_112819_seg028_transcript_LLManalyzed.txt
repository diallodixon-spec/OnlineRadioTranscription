============================================================

I say a scandal, but scandals don't seem to happen in the U.S. anymore with the Secretary of War and his knowledge of not only blowing up a boat, but having blown up the boat, two men over dropping out of the water, still alive, and the man then go back and lick that. The man himself is sinking. Which I've never seen, even in in World War II, if a plane going down, or has been shot down near the sea, you don't then fly over and shoot the pilot in the water. You move on. A different thing than what I did, Simon. I said I'm dead. And Hex is squirming like a beach wheel in order to try and get out of this.
