We're not feeling under the weather You just make me feel sweet Ice the cocoa tea, use the sugar I'm talking that we are complete, darling Heat me up Only you alone can put fire back in the soul Heat me me up And they tellin' me I should leave that fire alone When the more they tell me, it's the more I holdin' you close I could never let you go Me so she name, me so she name Girl, I put me no more, I see you
