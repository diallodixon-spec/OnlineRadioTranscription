20251215 104134 and what happened in Sydney yesterday was horrific and evil. So too, what has been happening to the people of Israel on October 7, 2023, when Hamas attacked and the response of the State of Israel led by Prime Minister Netanyahu. Equally horrific and evil. When you kill forty-odd thousand men, women, and children. So, we are now caught in a vicious cycle of violence and killings and murders. Who wins? None of us. None of us win. Yeah? Because make no mistake about it. What happened in Australia, Sydney yesterday is linked to what has been happening in Gaza. Yeah? And Israel.
