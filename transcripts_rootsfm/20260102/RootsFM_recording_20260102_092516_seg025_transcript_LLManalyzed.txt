20260102 092516 What makes a man With all the love That his heart can stand Dream of ways To throw it all away Gravity Is working against me And gravity Wants to bring me down Twice as much, ain't twice as good And can't sustain like one of you It's one and one, it's gonna bring you to my knees Gravity Stay the hell away from me Oh, twice as much, ain't twice as good, ain't kisses thank you
