2025-12-12 11:56:55 more smiles to Jamaicans, you know, over the season. And that's how the campaign was born, basically, just to give Jamaicans, not just our customers, but all Jamaicans, more reasons to smile this season. How do you do that? So from now until January the 24th, customers are able to win their share of over 30 million in cash and prizes. We are doing 64 winners of $250,000. And if you win that cash, you have the opportunity to either keep it or you can gift it to someone or a charity or any other person you know who may find it handy. We are also giving 32 persons grocery vouchers that are worth $50,000 each and this is perfect for families and also for charities as well and we're giving away 15 Samsung tablets tablets. And again, customers have the opportunity to either keep it or gift it. And we're awarding prizes every single week. We will be calling from 876-619-5000. So try and say that number. If you see it calling you, you may just have winnings on the other line.
