Because basically, he was trying to renew a visiting visa because remember, he was already there on a visiting visa. So, it had expired? Yes, it was. It expired on this year, September. Alright, so it sounds like you might need to do a consultation but I just have to let you know just generally, they're going to look at a person's ties to their home country and yes, financial is going to take a place especially when it's a student visa and I know you kept saying that it didn't work out, money didn't work out. So, I think that's where the problem is but maybe you can do a consultation and let's maybe talk about it. You can't force them to renew your visa, and you definitely can't force him to give you a student visa, it's only if you are eligible for it and it's discretionary. It's discretionary, yes I do want that.
