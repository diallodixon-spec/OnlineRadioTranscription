20260101 143224 Alright, we're back to continue the interview done with Chevelle Franklin and Delia Harris earlier in 2025. Really exciting stuff. Delia, I just asked a question to Chevelle regarding her performances and the things know the Christ that you are submitting yourself to. So that did help me, help to shape, to know about the one that I'm, the message. It helped to shape the message, It helped to shape my posture. I feel like I was trying to music ministry. At the time, they didn't really have one. But thank God they have it now. I don't think I've ever even heard a reggae song play now. I did just love the house. God had some really good people in there that day.
