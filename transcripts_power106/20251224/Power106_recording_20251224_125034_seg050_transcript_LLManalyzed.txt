20251224 125034 I had plenty of fun, man. But sometimes I just go and listen and tell somebody everyday call of them. I know some of them are my comrades. Are you a good comrade to them, though? Yeah, man, I'm a good comrade, but sometimes I need to rest. I don't like when I tell them that, but that's true. So what prompted you to call today? Drink a sorrel beer you better. No sir. You like sorrel beer? No I. What? None of them fancy thing there. Straight up red stuff. You like the lemon one, nice man. No man, you're not drink beer man. That's soda you want. So, tell me something. Them collect up your garbage and thing?
