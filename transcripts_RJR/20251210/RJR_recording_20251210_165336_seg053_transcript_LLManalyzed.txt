Oh my gosh, I got to thank Dr. Daryl Daly, consultant obstetrician and gynecologist, walking us through some health checks that we need to do as women before the new year. There it is. Don't wait on 2026. Also want to thank Nicolene Taylor, as one of the listeners said, very practical and logical advice for managing. Seriously practical and logical advice. Like information on credit cards? Yes. Spoke to me daily, spoke to me. Really helped us to manage our Christmas spending which, for example, is 10%, is better than none. See, every meekle will make a meekle. I want to thank our credit union Vibes family.
