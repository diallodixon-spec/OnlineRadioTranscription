============================================================

I don't need all those things that used to bring me joy You made me such a happy boy And honey, you'll always be the only one for me Meeting you was my destiny You can be sure I will never let you down When you need me I'll be around And darling you'll always be the only one for me Heaven made you special to me Could it be I'm falling in love? Could it be I am falling in love? With you, with you
