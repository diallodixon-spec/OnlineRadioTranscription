20251222 212519 Sadness had been Close as my next of kin Then a happy game one day Chased my blues away My life began when happy smiled Sweet like candy to a child Stay here and love me just a while Let Let sadness see what happy does. Let happy be where sadness was. Happy that you, you made my day.
