20251223 204026 Like a weary traveler in this world I'm passing through On my journey my downs are many and my ups are only a few I've been up on the mountaintop and I've been up on the mountain top and I've been down in the valley too This road I travel is not an easy one but by faith I am moving along For with Jesus I'll make it I know my needs will supply
