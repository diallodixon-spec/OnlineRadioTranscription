============================================================

Thank you very much for staying with us. Time to talk about the forces here now and we have a very special guest. The Sorbet Owners and Billings Association has confirmed that this year's animal power bed sale has been rescheduled. So it's time to welcome board member Mr. Desmond Lewis, my good friend DSG and the associates to Power Play for the first time. Hey, Desmond, very good evening. Welcome to Power Play, Cliff Williams here. Good evening, and thank you for having me. Absolutely. All right, um, change of date means certain things, certain adjustments that have to be made. What was the original date, um? Um, December.
