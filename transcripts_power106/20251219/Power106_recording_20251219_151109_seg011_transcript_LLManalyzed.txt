And I know Peter Thompson was very happy to come on board with this initiative. Mr. Thompson is executive director of the Jamaica Forage Clubs. Mr. Thompson, good afternoon. What a pleasure to see you at my location sir. It's always a pleasure seeing you wherever you are. Good to have you joining us and good to be able to do this for our listeners and for our farmers because that is what it comes down to.
