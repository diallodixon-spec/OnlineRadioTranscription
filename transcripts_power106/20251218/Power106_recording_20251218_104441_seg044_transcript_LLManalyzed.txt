20251218 104441 ongoing partnership where we are doing our restoration and rehabilitation fund to ensure that our farmers can begin production as soon as possible. So far we did a blitz in Westmoreland and in Trelawny. We're headed to Hannover next with that mission. We're also conducting farm assessments or damage assessments to see what exactly our farmers have lost and how exactly we can help them to replace that and get back to normalcy as soon as possible. So sooner than later, we will be offering grants to those persons who have been severely affected from those damage assessments. And so from there, we'll be able to get things as close to normalcy as possible. We're hoping for sooner rather than later. That's right. And of course course i love the enthusiasm and the confidence that you have and that will take you a long way in terms of keeping the morale up yes because we definitely need to do that at a time like this where we see everybody just kind of down based on what happened but we know that we're down but we're not out
