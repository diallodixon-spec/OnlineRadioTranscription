20260102 141011 Who knows? Who knows, who knows, who knows? I just go with the trapping blows Sending love to my friends and foes And I suppose I'm pleased to be chilling in the West Indies That provide all my wants and needs I got the sunshine, rivers and trees Released, yeah When the rain pitter-patter on the roof Herb just a steamed pepper pot on the stew Like it's a dream if you got gratitude So go tell the regime they can't stop where we do now Information you think on your own Or else you're a slave to the things that you know What do you know if you learn every day? So be careful of things where you say Who knows? Who knows, who knows, who knows?
