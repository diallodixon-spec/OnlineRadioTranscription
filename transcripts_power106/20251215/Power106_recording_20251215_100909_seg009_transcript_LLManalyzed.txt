20251215 100909 So the industrial space, as you know, is falling on the renewal that we saw in the commercial space in Jamaica over the last few years, with several new commercial buildings coming up. Now it's the industrial time for recapitalization. And our project, essentially, 55 acres, we have in the expanse which sits pretty much at the center of our distribution network. It sits astride the north-south highway, sits astride the east-west highway, and a stone's throw away from the port of Kingston, as well as the airport. So 65 acres, we are doing service lots between one to three acres. We have 34 lots in total. And what we believe sets our project apart from the other offerings in the market, which are also excellent offerings, is the fact that ours will be a secure park.
