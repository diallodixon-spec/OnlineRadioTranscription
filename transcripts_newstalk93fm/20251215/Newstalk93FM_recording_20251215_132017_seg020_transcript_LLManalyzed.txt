20251215 132017 I tried to be fine but I can't be The noise in my mind wouldn't leave me I tried to get by but I'm burning And behind my mind it runs All these thoughts I'm traveling Fighting to give up my pain Fighting to be on my lane My mind running to the other side When it's time to leave my life then it tries to take me out that you cannot mix one is the joy that you cannot waste and the other one price that you cannot fix
