20251230 114532 And I hope I can see you one more day when I hope you're good, I hope you're well, I hope you live. I miss your touch, I miss your smell, I miss your lips. Maybe grab a drink, maybe grab some food, don't miss you. I know it's hard, but I don't have to cry. I had to protect my heart and build the wall so tall I couldn't look over I need to touch you One more time, one more time I'll take you one by five, not on the wireless And though you said not to call you, you loved me
