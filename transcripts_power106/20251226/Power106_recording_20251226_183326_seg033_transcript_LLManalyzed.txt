20251226 183326 Today I woke up wondering Was I right or was I wrong Did I really mean to let you go Did I need to act so strong Was it the way of a fool's heart To agree to set you free All I know is our love is real And you'll come on back to me Oh I hope you find that the things in me Are the things you had with me Yes, I'll wait for you When I look out the window and I see a stranger go walking by I always imagine that to me
