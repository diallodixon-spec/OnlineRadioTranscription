2025-12-12 12:03:03 I wish that when I wake up, you're there To wrap your arms around me for real And tell me you'll stay by my side Clouds filled with stars cover the sky And I hope it rains You're the perfect lullaby What kind of dream For a beautiful nightmare Somebody pinch me You're not so good to me like you My guilty pleasure, I ain't going nowhere Baby, long day to hear I'll be floating on air Cause you're my sweet dream For a beautiful nightmare Be the way I am I don't wanna wake up like you
