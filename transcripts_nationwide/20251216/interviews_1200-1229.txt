**Interview with Garnett Reed, President of the Small Business Association of Jamaica**

In a recent interview with Nationwide News, Garnett Reed, President of the Small Business Association of Jamaica, called for an immediate rollback of the 7% increase in electricity bills for December. Reed stated that the increase would hurt small businesses, which are still recovering from the effects of Hurricane Melissa. He described the timing of the increase as "unconscionable" and urged the government to give the Jamaican people at least six months before implementing such a hike.

Reed also suggested that the government should not renew its contract with the Jamaica Public Service Company (JPS), citing the company's decision to pass on increased fuel costs to consumers as a reason. He argued that this would lead to more problems for businesses and consumers alike.

**Interview with Antonette Hamilton**

Antonette Hamilton, a business leader, shared her thoughts on the impact of the electricity bill increase on the business community. She noted that businesses may have to pass on the additional cost to their customers, which could lead to increased prices and potentially put some businesses out of operation. Hamilton emphasized the need for consultations before increasing input prices and expressed hope that the economy would recover soon.

**Interview with Minister Bartlett**

Tourism Minister Bartlett discussed the state of Jamaica's winter tourist season, which has seen a positive response from the market despite the challenges posed by Hurricane Melissa. He reported that 70% of the room stock was active at the start of the season and anticipated that occupancy would remain at around 70% until the middle of the year. Bartlett also highlighted the efforts of the ministry and the Jamaica Tourist Board to host travel agents and tour operators, which has helped to promote Jamaica's recovery and readiness to welcome visitors.

**Interview with Superintendent Coleridge Minto**

Superintendent Coleridge Minto, Head of the St. Elizabeth Police Division, discussed the significant reduction in murders in the parish, with a 47% decrease compared to the same period last year. He attributed this success to the deliberate work of the police and their ability to investigate, locate, and bring criminals to justice. Minto commended his team for their resilience and dedication, particularly in the face of challenging conditions, and warned potential criminals that they would be found and caught.

Note: These interviews were conducted with various guests, including Garnett Reed, Antonette Hamilton, Minister Bartlett, and Superintendent Coleridge Minto, and were featured on the Nationwide News program.
