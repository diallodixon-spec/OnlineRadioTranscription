20251223 131511 That's in this world Can't suffice the peace in my soul All I need is true satisfaction And that is what John gives to me So I write, I give thanks For my life and the chance To face another day And travel along the way. Gotta give thanks and praise. I start to lengthen my days. Oh Lord, with all my heart.
