20251226 134021 I see the fire spreading It's getting hotter and hot The heads will want to be In the shoes of the have-nots If the sign is on your door Then you will be safe for sure But you are in pretension, you're on the wrong side of the fence. Fire burning. Darling, can't you see what losing you has done to me? I'm not the same man I used to be so won't you have a heart and don't leave me standing in the dark cuz I'm lost without you can't find my way come back to me
