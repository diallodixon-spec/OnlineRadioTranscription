20251229 100002 No matter where I go, I'm not leaving. I said I'm not leaving Jamaica. I could have never left Jamaica. In comes King Kabaka, lyrical champion. Watch me chop up the rhythm like a sword from Japan. So bright and fluent like a real Chinese man. Practitioner of yoga but not Indian. Lyrics them a weapon of mass destruction. I have nuclear bomb like an American. Can't overstand like an Egyptian. I'm a glyphic when I shift it to the fifth dimension. And the rhythm not a fit me religion. You get twist up and plot up like a Brazilian. File off your face with the mic in my hand. Then sip a cup of tea like I come from England. A long time I'm a DJ in a dance. A long time, I'm a chant in a dance. I come from the nice of the area. I come from nice of Jamaica. I watch your jet. Dance off the clock. Dance on the lock. Lick off the lock. Charge you once a lock. People really see it and have to lock. Oh, lock. Promoter on the site, you have to lock. All them lock.
