Oh Wake up, don't you hear what I say Wake up, cause it's Christmas Day Cause I be rocking in my shoes to the street record group Ain't nobody gonna spoil my mood To this beautiful sunshine I'm rising up Just a positive vibe me use and build me up Overflowing like they had coffee in a me cup Ain't no time for easin' up Christmas is coming Christmas is on its way Christmas is coming It's a happy holiday
