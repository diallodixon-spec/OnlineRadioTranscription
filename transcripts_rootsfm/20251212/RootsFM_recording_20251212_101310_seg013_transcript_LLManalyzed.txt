We'll meet his end one day Some juvenile will have to earn his strike And have to take another gunman's life What if a boxed up a name says Christ? And how ironic if him dead from night The amount of bullets where him put one boil Chop the strips and kill and destroy Now tell me is it worth it all? If wonder and rise then our ne next must fall Tell me, is is worth it all? Those sleepless nights and virtual call Tell me, is it all worth it all? One child smile while the next one ball Tell me is it worth it? Is it worth it?
