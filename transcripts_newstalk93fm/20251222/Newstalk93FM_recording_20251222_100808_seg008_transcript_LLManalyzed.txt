20251222 100808 We are now at the end of our drive. We hope you enjoyed this drive. If you did by the stage door packed in with the autograph hounds barking her name then glowing like the end of a cigarette while she came out i said you live in my dream then she said to me hey thank you for the lovely bouquet you You're sweeter than a peach, but you don't know the life of a showgirl, babe. And you're never, ever gonna wait. The more you play, the more that you pay. You're softer than a kitten.
