All the time I was outside I was creeping It was love at first sight girl when you walked in Couldn't look deep in your eyes cause I didn't like it You was hurting deep inside and you was broken But I was on the other side and didn't notice, oh I won't waste no time I won't waste my time when it comes to you Put my pride aside, give it all to you Put my proud aside, no girl I won't waste no time when it comes to you put my pride aside give it all to You put my pride aside. Give it all to Pulling up fast for you two to three three bus rounds for you All eyes on me, got me feeling like, but I do it all for you Don't get caught up in them lies before you know the truth I be down to risk it all if you ask me to Ain't playing with your heart cause that's too much to lose
