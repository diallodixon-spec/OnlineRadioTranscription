20251231 190004 Baby come chill with me, baby come chill with me. We have trouble at home. Baby take the pain, oh Claudette, blazing the fire, loving the vibes. Jimmy over there in Seaview Gardens, loving the vibes as well. Oh, that's Sonya. God up in Crow, way up in the hills. Yeah, man, big up yourself, Sonya. Thanks for keeping it locked. All right, time for the break. After the break, I got some gospel music for you. Record style, of course. So please don't change that dial't change that dial. Let me get some praises. Before the 2025 over. See?
