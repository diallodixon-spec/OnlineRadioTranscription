20251216 200202 Come in my baby How she come from there Atlanta she come from there Toronto she come from there And I know that you miss me I love the way that you bring a vibe With your hands them up in the sky Falling down and hopping at time Wine and CSN again And we have the money to spend And we jamming down to the end Runnin' with me cannibal friend We'll be meet up again. Everything on site, you know. The bag gone packed, you know. She dreaming to take a ride on me. Cause she coming down to please. When she ram a chair, she push it back, all the bamba rolling. And she's saving some for me. I tell you, I love you.
