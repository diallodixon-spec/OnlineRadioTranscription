20260102 094330 Not a good thing. I don't think it's a good thing. They don't have the resources neither. I think it's terrible and we can't behave like the ostrich. We cannot hide our face in the sand. We have to deal with it. Now, going forward for the new year, my first topic has to be inflation. And, you know, I know that we have a lot of important inflation in Jamaica. But I still believe that the supermarket and other places can do better. There is no question that we have to contain in facial. The other point I want to raise is the health sector.
