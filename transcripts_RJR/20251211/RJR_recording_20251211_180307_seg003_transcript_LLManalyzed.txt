2025-12-11 19:24:52 Mr. Carr disclosed that the country is not experiencing a spike in cases of dengue or COVID-19 based on tests conducted by the ministry. With respect to dengue, it continues to be at low activity, so we are not even seeing the seasonal level of dengue at this time. But the risk still remains as the dengue season usually continues to the early part of the year. With respect to respiratory infections, acute respiratory infections are within normal. And while some indicators show that we may be in a season of influenza, if we look at the chart with the cases with the number of positive influenza, respiratory syncytial viruses are what are circulating. At this time we are not really seeing much COVID-19. With respect to gastroenteritis we are within normal limit for week 49. That's last week. Principal Medical Office and National Epidemiologist Dr. Karen
