Stay together and we go in places, yeah All be by your side, no matter the case We have a one way ticket to greatness, greatness Girl I don't want to lie, cause I believe in the truth And I just wanna live good I just wanna live in you I don't want no dirty secrets fighting me and you We drive one car at a time But I I still want to But I still want to Now let me get to the truth, truth, truth I just wanna live good Look the sun could shine the same time with the moon
