20251219 110505 as Ugly Sweater Day. But why should we stop at sweaters? We've all had that one outfit, that one put together thing that we were forced to wear that made us cringe. Maybe it was a school uniform that wasn't sewn quite right, a hand-me-down from a relative or a gift or a costume for a play. So today we're celebrating those fashion disasters with a game called Ugliest Outfit Confessions. So all I'm asking you to do is on WhatsApp, the ugliest piece of clothing you've ever had to wear, tell us the story behind it, who gave it to you, why you had to wear it, what happened. Please, I want to react to every single story that you send to me.
