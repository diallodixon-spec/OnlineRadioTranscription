20251229 123524 I could keep my cool, but tonight I'm whining I'm a bee In a dangerous mood, can you match my timing? Telling me That you're really about it, why'd you hide it? Talk is cheap So show me That you understand i like it can you blow my mind set off my whole body if i give you my time can you stretch my soul from it I don't wanna wait. Don't take it. Take me where I ain't been before. Can you blow my mind? Set off my whole body.
