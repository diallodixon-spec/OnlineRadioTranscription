I'm the hustle and the bustle tonight. And I don't know where you wanna go. But I'm willing to take you there. Girl, just be who you wanna be. Once you're with me, baby, have no fear. So much beautiful things to see. Girl, don't waste a life. And there is only one love to take you somewhere Tonight I don't know if I'll ever leave But I beg you come chill with me tonight Why oh why oh why Oh why oh why oh why I beg you put down the book I beg you put it down
