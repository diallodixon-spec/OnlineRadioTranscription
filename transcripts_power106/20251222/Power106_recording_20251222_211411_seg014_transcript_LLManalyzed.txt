20251222 211411 When it goes up, come again with a debate to me and let me see if I can understand how many people there are, and everybody is listening, listening, and change their ways and their dirty minds, and still struggle to get out, and still struggle, and quarrel over food and quarrel over land, and they're sitting there. And pastor, one thing again let me ask you. For me it's how the world creates the pastor, listen to people all around the world. And everybody when we talk, they can't understand. But we have Spanish listener, Spanish talker, other countries talk their style. We can't talk 100 styles. Some people are violent, they don't understand when we talk on the radio. And everything you can't understand, brother. Pastor preach and pastor heal and all that, something. And everything pastor go tell you, brother. Everything pastor go tell you. Go and get the baccala heal in Ireland. And what we ever want to do. And do it. People are telling you those tricks. You understand me, pastor?
