Here I lay all alone, tossing, turning, longing for some of your tender love. I'm waiting for the right moment to come so I can thank you for all the tender love Love so tender, holding me close to you Baby, I surrender Candles fade like the dark Now I see how lovely the feelings are The tender love you're giving to me
