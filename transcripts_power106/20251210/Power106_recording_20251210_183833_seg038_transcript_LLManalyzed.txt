three professional fights. Can you repeat that? Hello? No, no, no. Start over for me. Start again. Go back to the top of it and start over. Okay, so I will just say that on Saturday we're going to have a total of ten bouts, three which will be professional fights, seven amateur fights. Of the three professional, we're going to be very lucky to have some international boats. We have two of our Jamaican boxers, one which is undefeated, and, yeah. So we're gonna have the main boss gonna be German cross-breed Bowen from a very, very tough fighter from the West, from Negril. So his record is five weeks.
