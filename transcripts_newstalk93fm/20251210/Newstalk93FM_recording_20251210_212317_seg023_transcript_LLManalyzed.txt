============================================================

They don't want me in their party I ain't don't listen to nothing they say Every fast I jump, jumping up Doing what I want, jumping up Tell Look how the security watch me. They don't know I'm out there. I don't smash up the place and I be straight like a jumbie. I don't wait, they don't want me in their party day. They don't want me cause I do. I don't wait. I ain't don't listen to nothing they say. Everybody's a drunk, jumping up, doing what they want.
