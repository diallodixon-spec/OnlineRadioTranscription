Oh So it's good to have cash on you not just the the card not just the card because I see many cases where the card feels The card can't see it. It failed me. Mm-hmm multiple times I bring people places on their car to stop working. They have to try to call the bank, different time zones. Have as much cash because what you can do, you can have the cash, take it with you, don't use it and take it back and put it on an account. Then say, oh, let me just carry $100 because I have $500,000 on my card. That's a no as a first time traveler. Carry the cash, have the cash, and the card is a backup. Don't have, but if you see the opportunity and use the card, let the card be the first preference. Go ahead, use the card. As long as the card will charge, use it, but have the cash.
