2025-12-12 14:12:17 You'll make a way By a roadway in the wilderness You'll be me Rivers in the desert will I see Heaven and earth will fade But His Word will still remain And He will do something new today Oh God, we'll make a way Where there seems to be no way He works in ways we cannot see He will make a way for me He will be my eye Hold me closely to Him
