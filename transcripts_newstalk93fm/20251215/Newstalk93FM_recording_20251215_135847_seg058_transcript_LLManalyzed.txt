20251215 135847 So we breathe. Waiting for the right one is the hardest thing I've done. If I knew that you were right there, then I'd never write this song. Joy is yours and mine. Story of our love. So divine. Look you in the eyes. The pleasure is all mine. Sing the chorus one more time, Lord, he's nice So nice, so nice, so nice Never catch a vibe that feels so right When you're not around, I close my eyes and fantasize Lord, he's sweet So sweet, so sweet, so sweet Every time he pass, me skin the teeth Me and the melody, and him and the beat Are so sweet, every time you pass me skin me teeth. Me and the melody and the mighty beat are so sweet. You are the one, the only one me have to confess, you are the one, so me not run out and test. All I wanna do, give my all to you.
