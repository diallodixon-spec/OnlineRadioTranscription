20251226 192716 You call me crazy, maybe that is true But what can I do, I love your girl You got me moving, moving left and right Deep within the night, come here my dear You give me faith, love I can't explain Fire uncontained, what is this girl? I try to fight it, but I never win Seems I just give in to your embrace But oh, oh I pray you never leave Oh, cause my heart would surely grieve so girl Oh, and you know I would not lie Girl you are my pride, baby stay with me
