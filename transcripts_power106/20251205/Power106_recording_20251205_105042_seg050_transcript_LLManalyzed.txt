The way the man them a said is that them could a get money for bring in if them get an extension or the license because the body not going to lend them money for two years. No, no, no, that is true. So you can't use badness and deal them thing there and them controls them and try to bad up everybody. Cause if you know what they say, the whole of them come with this tough talk, you know, like they want everybody to be free to them and they want to talk about it. I don't know where I'm going with this, I don't know what really I'm going. I'm not going to sit in Jamaica and reach them and kill them. Something's wrong, man. Something's wrong. And the next thing again, before I move, I want to know why they put a meter and give me an estimated bill and I have to meet up with them. I can't understand that. That's another thing that came out of the PAC where the man said, oh, you are not doing the work that you're supposed to do. No, man.C. was when they said O.U.R. didn't do the work that they were supposed to do. No man, me and me can't give them an estimated bill. How can that be? This is our work man. Yeah man and the people from OUR couldn't answer the question when they got out of the P A A C. So they said nothing is run right. And the estimated bill is usually more than your usual bill.
