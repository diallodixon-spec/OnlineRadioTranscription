20251226 141011 She just wants to be Beautiful she goes I know that she knows All that means she craves Attention she praises An image she prays to be Sculpted by the sculptor Oh she don't see The light that's shining Creeper than the eyes can find it maybe we've made her blind so she tries to cover up her pain and cut her waves away as couple girls don't cry after their faces met but there's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark You should know you're beautiful just the way you are And you don't have to change a thing, the world could change its heart No scars, see you're beautiful, we're stars, we're beautiful
