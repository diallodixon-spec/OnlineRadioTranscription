20251219 092519 I've been drinking more, oh, for the past five days Did you check on me? Now did you look for me? I walked in the room eyes are red and I don't smoke banga Did you check on, did you check on me Now did you notice me? Nobody will know the paranoia Cause I put a smile on my face A facade you can never face And if you don't know me well at all You won't see how buried I am inside my grave Inside my grave Cause you see people, people, people People don't really know you
