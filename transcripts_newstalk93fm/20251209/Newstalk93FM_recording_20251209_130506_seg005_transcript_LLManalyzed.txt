Well, if you're coming down for this season Fives and link it up Call them wine cause they're feeling Sweet like a nickel So ring a case at the room Careful you don't drop it, it'll go break on the ground Family a come and everybody watch out We not go fair till the back and all done Party time till the morning come Me love it when you jiggle it up for me How time that you give me the property Let me live in your fantasy Sweet girl, give me jam, give me jam And if you're coming down for this season Fives and link it up Girl, them wine got the feeling Sweet like honeycomb Oh yeah, girl, them backing up that thing there Nothing at the place, well at the summit there Girl, tip it up on your toe and catch, balance it So my girl, you got the wine for the season. Back it up with the wine, for the season. Sexy gal, when you bubble up your race, and you're mashing up the place with the wine for this season, all right? Bubble up your race, so you're thicker, so you talk, y'all. We love to move when you're getting drunk.
