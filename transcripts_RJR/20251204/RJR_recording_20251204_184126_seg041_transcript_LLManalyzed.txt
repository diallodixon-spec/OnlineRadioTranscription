It was a great feeling, it was a great feeling. It goes to show that if you invest in students, you can actually see the result. They just want to feel a sense of care. If they know that you care for them, they will work hard for you. You know, Ms Watson, I do so many interviews with people, adults, people in their 30s, 40s, 50s, and so many of them will tell you about a terrible negative experience they had with a teacher and how it has stuck with them their entire life. So hearing you describe the positive is I wanted to get the CSIC experience. Hold that thought for me, because I'm right at sports, but there's so much more I want to talk to you about. I'm going to ask you to hold on.
