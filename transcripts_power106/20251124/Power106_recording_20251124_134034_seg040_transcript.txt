It's frightening. So fire did come, sir? Yes, sir. Some people said they saw things just light up. But you've never seen any tornadoes? They go past a building and they rip it apart and then you see fire afterwards? You've never watched any movie or anything at all with tornadoes? And even if it doesn't light fire that you can see, everything turns brown because literally the temperature yeah he just just burns it it's almost like a true acid on on grass this is frightening this is shocking sir sir when you have to look forward to the future well
