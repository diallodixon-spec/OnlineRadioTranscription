20251216 162214 I'm in the mood to pull something up. I wanna go missing. I need a prescription. I wanna go higher. Can I sit on top of you? I wanna go where nobody's been. Have you ever had fun like this? We're gonna roll up tonight. Black lights. Spaceships fly. Spaceships fire. Unapologetic when we pull up tonight. Roll it up, roll it down. Roll up tonight. We gettin' pulled up tonight. We're gonna, we're gonna. We gon' roll up tonight. We gon' see fire. At you you'll see stars. At you you elevate. At you you lead us. Still feel like fallin' in love. I'm in the mood to put something up.
