20251212 190305 Waste pretty face you floored up You ain't gotta pay for drinks no more Cause I done found what I've been looking for all along I'm talking about when it rang everything On if it's wetter babe as I take name to my love language Let them say what they say They bout to be like I don't care that they can map it in a club I'm talking about swimming in vitamins You can fit it in fitting in the back of my truck for me Don't take your love for me clearly you need a club you need a club baby i'm over something you make me want to go crazy back it up
