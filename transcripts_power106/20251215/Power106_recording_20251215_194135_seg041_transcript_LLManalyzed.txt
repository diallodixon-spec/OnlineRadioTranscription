20251215 194135 became a reality just a couple years ago when he was president. The brainchild of our first black international grandmaster, Grandmaster Maurice Ashley, who was born in Jamaica last year, 12 years old, became a grandmaster in the United States. And Dr. Nigel Clark, who was minister of finance, but also a chess official rather, just like the most notable Andrew Horne as the prime minister. And the idea was Jamaica's not had a homegrown grandmaster, so we wanted to have our own grandmaster. And we decided to embark on this program where for over a 10-year period, we would try to produce a grandmaster. So we would go through all corners of Jamaica, look at the talent, nurture that talent in a sustained environment, in a program, which is supervised by Mr. Ashley, Grandmaster Ashley, with a number of our local coaches, including some of our top players and coaches, Mr. Peterson, I mentioned earlier, International Master.
