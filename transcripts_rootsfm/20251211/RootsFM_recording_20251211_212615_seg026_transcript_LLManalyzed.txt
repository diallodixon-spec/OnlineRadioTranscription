2025-12-12 09:29:43 since I saw you I've been running around in circles in my mind And it always seems that I'm following you, girl Cause you take me to the places that alone I'd never find And even as I wander, I'll keep you in sight. You're a candle in the window to cool down when it's night. But I'm getting closer than I ever thought I'd be.
