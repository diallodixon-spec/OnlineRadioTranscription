Good evening. Good evening, Mr. Hughes. Good evening, Ricardo, and your listeners. All right, so we're waiting to be joined by Emile Liber. Ladies, welcome. Antoinette Hamilton, let me start with you. The state of micro, small, and medium-sized businesses, especially following Hurricane Melissa. Well, similar to other businesses, we are in our rebound speed again, similar to what happened after Burrill, where, you know, the economy would have contracted consecutively. And then in Q1-2 and 3, we saw stable growth. So we're looking forward to similar progressions.
