============================================================

I won't be afraid to be who I am Making boundaries I'm making boundaries Walls so thick that you won't climb Lying so long that you can't find my heart Will never be something for anyone to trample on again. Gotta protect me to the end. Every no means a yes to yourself. I appreciate how far you show up for yourself. Can't breathe the world beyond one with yourself. Self-investment.
