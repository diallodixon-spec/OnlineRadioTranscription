In Jamaica, it's very, very, very important. Important for real. This has nothing to do with money or fame or vanity. This one is all about self-worth. So pick up your chest and stand proud and don't matter about nobody no man no more than no man on the set so whether you walk or you a drive car it don't matter if you a hit or block light or hear me say from you feel good you know yourself you a star push up who you wanna tell all the haters I'm a big deal yeah me and my friends they my big deal wanna listen up you know it's very important for real. Christmas in Jamaica is a big deal, and you know this is a big deal. Listen up, it's very, very, very important. Important for real. It's like you have the Prime Minister.
