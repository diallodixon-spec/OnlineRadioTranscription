**Inspiring Story of Dr. Lincoln Ferguson: From Humble Beginnings to Paying it Forward**

In a heartwarming and inspiring interview with Dionne Jackson-Miller on Radio Jamaica's "Yardies Abroad," Dr. Lincoln Ferguson, a Jamaican Chief of Pediatric Emergency Medicine at Mount Sinai South Nassau Hospital in New York, shared his remarkable life story. From a difficult childhood to achieving great success, Dr. Ferguson's journey is a testament to the power of perseverance, hard work, and the impact of positive role models.

Dr. Ferguson's father passed away when he was just six years old, leaving his family in a difficult financial situation. However, his life took a dramatic turn when he was taken under the wing of Dr. Fenton Ferguson, a dentist and former politician. Dr. Ferguson became like a father to him, providing guidance, support, and love. This experience had a profound impact on Dr. Ferguson's life, shaping his values and inspiring him to pay it forward.

Dr. Ferguson's academic journey was not without its challenges. He had to work hard to prepare for his exams, often facing difficulties such as not having a math teacher for a while. However, with the help of Dr. Ferguson, he was able to overcome these obstacles and eventually gained admission to medical school. His time at medical school was marked by dedication and perseverance, and he was able to perform well despite the challenges he faced.

After completing his medical training, Dr. Ferguson went on to work at Princess Margaret Hospital in Jamaica, where he was able to give back to his community. He also started a scholarship program to help students in need, ensuring that they received the support and dignity they deserved. This program was particularly meaningful to Dr. Ferguson, given his own experiences of struggling financially as a student.

One of the most inspiring aspects of Dr. Ferguson's story is his decision to pay it forward by helping others. He has taken in and supported several young people, including a student named Kevin, who is now a doctor. Dr. Ferguson's guidance and support have made a significant impact on Kevin's life, and their story is a testament to the power of mentorship and positive role models.

Dr. Ferguson attributes his success to a combination of hard work, guidance, and God's blessings. He is proud of his achievements, including his children's successes – his son is an engineer who attended MIT, and his daughter is a doctor who attended Harvard. Dr. Ferguson's story is a reminder that with determination, perseverance, and the right support, anyone can achieve their goals and make a positive impact on the world.

As Dr. Ferguson so eloquently put it, "I feel like it's something I have to do. Like it just was something that I had to do." His selfless actions and inspiring story serve as a reminder of the importance of paying it forward and making a positive difference in the lives of others.
