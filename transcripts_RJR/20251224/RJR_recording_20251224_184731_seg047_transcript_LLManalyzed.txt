We came here last year and I believe it helped us to see where we were at this time of the year. We did well last year at Champs, and we came to this meet for one of the first times. So we are repeating the same. So this meet is important to us. I ran 200 meters earlier today, and I'm not satisfied with my time, but I'm grateful.
