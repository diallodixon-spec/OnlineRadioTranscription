20251218 211210 Oh, I don't like living under your spotlight. Maybe if you treat me right, you won't have to worry. Is this a relationship fulfilling your needs as well as mine? Or is this just my sentence? Am I doing time? If this is love, real, real love, then I'm saying no doubt but if i'm just lost prisoner then i'm busted out oh baby i don't lie living under your spotlight
