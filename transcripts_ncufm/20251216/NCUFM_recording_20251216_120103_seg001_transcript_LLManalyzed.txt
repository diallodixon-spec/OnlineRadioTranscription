The Jamaica Council for Persons with Disabilities, JCPD, is urging all stakeholders involved in the post-Hurricane Melissa rebuilding process to ensure that buildings are redesigned and constructed to guarantee accessibility for all citizens, including persons with disabilities. Executive Director Dr. Christine Hendricks emphasizes that persons rebuilding should do so using the universal design principles. And finally, with the holidays approaching and many Jamaicans welcoming visitors into their homes, the Jamaica Fire Brigade, JFB, is urging households to review and practice their fire safety plans to guard against avoidable calamities.
