Father, as our praises arise before you, it is our heart's desire that you would consume us with your presence to saturate our minds, our hearts. Father, as we sing. Till all they see. Father, it's you. Glory by your name. Yes, Jesus. Fill us, God. Saturate us, God, till all they see is you. Glory by your name.
