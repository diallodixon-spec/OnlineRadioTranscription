============================================================

You can never love me too much, too much to never be enough If I'm being honest, yeah The way you hold me, The way you look at me Talk to me, rise for me, hold me up Never let me down I like the way that you move So keep on doing what you do Baby just rock with me and I'll rock with you. You found me enough. You can never love me too much. Too much just ain't enough. You found me.
