Rescue ting, rescue ting, rescue ting She said I'm for nothing, sympathy, sympathy She said I'm not going to see my skin, my skin, skin When I'm in need of loving I will turn to you, only you you I've crushed nothing since lately My girl she runnin' cold and woke up in a tracy When all the lies she teed up about that never faze me But friend them lies before I'm done, I say my **** be kind and I lie till you're free, baby I'll miss you tight
