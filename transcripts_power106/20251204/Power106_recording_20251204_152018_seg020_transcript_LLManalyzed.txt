December come and Christmas song a play Christmas come and Christmas please a blow Festive parties a session every day Christmas come and Christmas, please a blow Cats of smiles and laughter all about Christmas come and Christmas Please a blow And children dreaming of gifts without a doubt Christmas feeling seeping through jammed down Jamaican Santa with points set ya all around Oh if we no have mistletoe we no have no snow or ice But we have Jamaican Christmas and all the Christmas lights Christmas breeze, Christmas breeze of love Can you feel it? Christmas breeze, Christmas freeze of love Christmas breeze, Christmas, freeze of love
