20251229 161816 I'd rather be alone than be unhappy I don't choose you for me Cause I know I'd rather be alive I'm not the sort of person who falls in quickly out of love But to you I gave my all Right from the sky How could I break such a heart you can still get my attention right from the start Why do you come here When you know I got troubles in love Why do you call me When you know I can't answer the phone Make me laugh
