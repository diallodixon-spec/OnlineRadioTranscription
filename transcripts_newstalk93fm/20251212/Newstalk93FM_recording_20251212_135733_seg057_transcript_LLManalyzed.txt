20251212 135733 I've never had a love like this before. Never had a love like, ooh, yeah, yeah. I've never had love like this before, never had a love, like, ooh, ooh. Sent for the chocolate, sent for the wine wine She don't want no roses She want to have a good time Light up the chalice Under the moonlight Who is where the heart is I I be right here by your side Never had a love like this before
