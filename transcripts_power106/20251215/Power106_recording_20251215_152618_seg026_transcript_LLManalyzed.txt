Yes, I have a title. I have a title for mine. Oh, you do. You have a title for you piece. I've got a title for the entire life. All right, so get a surveyor in. You might have to, or you could give him a lease for that piece, you know, a 99-year lease for that piece. But I prefer it to be tidy if you get a surveyor to come in and see if you can get it subdivided for him to get a title for that little piece that he has put the big house on, the house that is bigger than the lot.
