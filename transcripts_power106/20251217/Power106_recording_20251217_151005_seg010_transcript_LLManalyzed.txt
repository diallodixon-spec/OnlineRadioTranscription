20251217 151005 So I'm wondering if that dark side, please, because we're down in a gully. If you have a tank as a catchment, we are in a catchment. And I'm wondering when the rain fall and those things go in the ground. Probably have to call like a scientist. You have to call a NEPA. Probably you can talk to somebody. NEPA? No, I'm talking on the radio if somebody could come on. I don't know if it's distant from Manuel to here, maybe it would not affect us. But I'm thinking, I'm wondering if when the rain falls and that thing not moving and the water keep seeping in the ground, if it could come in the well and are finding their way into wells, water supply, essentially.
