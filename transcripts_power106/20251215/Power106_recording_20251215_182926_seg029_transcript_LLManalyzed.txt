I remember when Zed Blatter was promoting female football and he was traveling the world saying that it will be the future of football. And I myself doubted it would be the future and I still doubt doubt that it will be the future, but I think it will come on par, close to being on par with the men's sport. But I remember when a lot of people were rebuffing it, like no way, you know, you still have today where a lot of people still don't believe in female playing soccer. You'd be surprised to realize that. But I think a lot more people are buying into it. If you look at the last World Cup, for the first time in the history of the game, stadiums were full. That is so significant, and that is a testimony of what Zed Blatter saw coming, or the potential of it.
