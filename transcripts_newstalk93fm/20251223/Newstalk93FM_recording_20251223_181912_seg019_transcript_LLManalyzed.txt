20251223 181912 If I give you my love, make you know this, I want to. So many people won't lick my skews, so baby, chew me, cause I'm in your tools. And if I undo your two by two, you fit to scream, you could lose in your pool. So many reasons are written in the stars, oh my god, yeah, the reason I do what I do. So baby, make you give me your love. Make you give me that love. If you give me me, I don't go like, oh. Make me make I kill myself, oh. Feel it's gonna be hitting on the freaky dance floor Make you give me that love If you give me me I'm not gonna let go Make you give me me cause you're my zanko Feelings got me hittin' on a freaky dance floor Diallo, diallo If I give you my love Make you not disappoint me
