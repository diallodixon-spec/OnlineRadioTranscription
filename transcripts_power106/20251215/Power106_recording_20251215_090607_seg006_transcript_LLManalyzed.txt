20251215 090607 I don't need a stocking or a fireplace Cause I have you to put a smile on my face We have each other like the moon and star You are my Christmas, yes you are I don't need the present or a glowing tree When I've got you right here with me Always beside me, never afar You are my Christmas, yes you are No frosty windows, no sleighs on the street But your presence made the silence oh so sweet The snow might fall or it might stay away But you were my all year round Christmas bouquet Sorry Santa, I don't wanna waste your time Give someone else a present, I've got mine
