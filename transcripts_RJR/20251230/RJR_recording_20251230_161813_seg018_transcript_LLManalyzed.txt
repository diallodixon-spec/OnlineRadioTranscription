20251230 161813 I'm from a place where blood spills And nothing to send you yet till As morning light, you're like a quarrel Them babies don't come from morning Me no come from a normal tone You know why you're belittling them songs Paris Hotel with the trees by phone And a bed with a sweat for people like you We live in a gangster city All of my thugs and my bar, it grew a ruckus, now we not grow like them. Gangster city. There's enough to escape, we're not nice. Dems of the city will never change, and things will never rearrange. But we're not a change, I changed my thugs' stems, I'm not flexin' a strain. Man's still in the city, what I have to say now. Man kickin' me the happy way, and I gots all the way, thugs not gonna hide away.
