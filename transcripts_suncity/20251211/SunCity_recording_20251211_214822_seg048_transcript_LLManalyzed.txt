2025-12-12 15:37:00 Never used to go out without you. I'm not sure I remember how to. Gonna be late, gonna be late, but all my girls gon' have to wait. Don't know if I like my outfit. I try everything in my closet. Nothing feels right when I'm not with you. Sick of this dress and these jimmy shoes. Taking the path cause I feel a boom. Trying to dress up when I'm missing you, boom. Drop, dropping bangers this Christmas. This Christmas. Your favorite Christmas DJ. Favorite Christmas DJ. Son of y'all, sorry, Shane. Hey, gotta be strong, gotta be strong But I'm really hurting now that you're gone I thought maybe I'd do some shopping But I couldn't get past the door and Now I don't know, now I don't know
