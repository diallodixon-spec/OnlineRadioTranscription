20251218 195647 female cyclist Lori Sharpe has been hospitalized with injuries after being knocked from her bicycle once again while training in the Bogor Gorge in St. Catherine on Wednesday morning. It comes out just five months after the 2024 RGR Mini-National World Women's Cyclists of the Year sustained a fractured ankle that injured her shoulder in a separate crash which sidelined her for nearly two months. Despite that upset, Shar Backshark made a strong return to competition in October, capturing the silver medal in the Women's Elite in the Winner of Time Trial at the Caribbean Elite Road Cycling Championship in Belize. And that's sports update or quote of the day. Everyone wants to win, but to truly succeed whether in sport, on the job or in life, you must be willing to do the hard work, push through the challenges, and make the sacrifices required to the best at what we do. From Wanda Grousey, American professional wrestler and actress, that's our program for today. Hope you enjoyed it as much as we did enjoy bringing it to you.
