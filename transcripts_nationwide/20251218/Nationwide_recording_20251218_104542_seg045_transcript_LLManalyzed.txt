So today, although we are having a scaled-down version of the awards ceremony that we had originally planned, it is by no means a reflection of the value of the work and worth of our officers who are sitting before us today. We are here to celebrate their hard work, dedication, and service, and we stand with those officers in the West who are showing their unwavering commitment to continue to serve, protect and reassure the rest of us, despite their own personal challenges.
