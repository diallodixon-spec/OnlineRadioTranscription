20251223 124534 I can't live without you, Lord. Oh, make it on my own. I'm begging you, Lord. Please have mercy. Sometimes it's hard. But I know you're working on me. On things some can't see But you said you love me and you'll never leave So I trust, pray, obey and believe You've given me the keys, so now I am set free. Oh, where, where else can I go but you alone?
