20251217 173924 I am humbly suggesting that children should not be criminalized for making a mistake when their hormones are raging, when there was no force, and when they have accepted their mistake. I believe counseling is the better avenue. I believe that once they're accused of a crime, it is only the boy who is being accused, not the girl, and this is unfair. So this gendered approach of placing the boys who I will submit, they're already marginalized. You are putting them in a system that is already skewed against them because it is the males who primarily make up offenders in Jamaica. Okay, let me bring in Shirley.
