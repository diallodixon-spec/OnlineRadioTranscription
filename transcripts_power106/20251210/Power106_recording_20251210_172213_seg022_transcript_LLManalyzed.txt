And this Wednesday is no different and we have the pleasure of once again being joined online by the Managing Director of Jamaica Turbo Repair Services Company Limited. He is Mr. Roderick Biles and we have a very interesting topic this afternoon. How can we help you to understand the costs associated to repairing the various types of damage caused by potholes on our roads. Of course, a number of persons would be having to negotiate some potholes, others, craters throughout Jamaica's road network from alignment issues, balancing issues, more serious mechanical issues, what comprises the gamut of problems that you can experience as a result of potholes on our roads and what are the fixes. Let's once again welcome Roderick Biles to the Autoworld. Hi Roderick, how are you doing?
