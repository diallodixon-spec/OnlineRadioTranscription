20251216 125833 Because I have you I'm safe, I'm safe I'm safe You ever cried so many tears I feel like you can't cry no more You ever fought and you kept on fighting till you can't fight no more his grace takes over when all strength comes to an end when my eyes can't see ahead of me it takes all of my hands Because I have you And I know you got me too
