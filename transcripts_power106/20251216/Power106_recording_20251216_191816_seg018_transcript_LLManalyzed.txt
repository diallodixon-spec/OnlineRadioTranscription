So I started really young. I was probably five or six when I started right here in Bull Bay, Jamaica. And yeah, fell in love with surfing. I always knew I wanted to be a professional surfer since I started. And yeah, it's just really good to be working on it for that long and for so many years, and seeing the fruits of the labour.
