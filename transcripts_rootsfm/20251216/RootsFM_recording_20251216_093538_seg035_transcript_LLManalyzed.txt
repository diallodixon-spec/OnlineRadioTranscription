20251216 093538 Someone you could talk to how could you just keep breaking my heart. What did I do to you? To make you be so cruel? I don't understand why you've been so wrong. I tried to be your strength. You said I was too strong. I tried to cover up lies so we could get along. I gave my love to you despite your evil ways. I guess it's clear to me there's only one thing left to say. Do what you do.
