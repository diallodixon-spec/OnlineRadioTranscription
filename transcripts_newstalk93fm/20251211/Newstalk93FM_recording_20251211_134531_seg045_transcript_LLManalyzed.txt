You're listening to sleek radio 93 FM You heard me. My love, love. Can't just give you my love. Love, love. Sweat, sweat, sweat for real. Love, love, can't just give me my love. Love. Love. Can't you just sweat, sweat, sweat. Sweat for real. You wanna move you back to bed, but you a real one. You fine as hell, you know just nobody like you, boy. And in my heart, you are so gentle, but you still are. Baby, I love you when you make me feel, yeah. But I don't want to be naive, don't want to regret. Because the love will let me know.
