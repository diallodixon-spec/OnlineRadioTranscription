So while you hold on, it's not yours. If it was, then it wouldn't brought bitter tears. You're like an emotional roller coaster. You got to face your hurts and fears. Let it go. Stop worrying, stressing, please. Just take it slow Release your heart and set your mind at ease There comes a point in your life You gotta let it go People listen to me please, let it go Stop worrying, don't be stressing Please just take it slow Release your heart
