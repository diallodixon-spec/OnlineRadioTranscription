20251219 212718 So we do it Who you remember Every word your eyes spoke to me to sweetest surrender Thought that I would grow so weary the love gets better Now my girlfriends they see it too The glow on my face is because of you. You are, you are. You're my piece of mind. Mine, mine. Oh, all mine. Now they realize why, why, oh, why nice, so nice. Never catch a vibe that feels so right. When you're not around, I close my eyes and thank you so much.
