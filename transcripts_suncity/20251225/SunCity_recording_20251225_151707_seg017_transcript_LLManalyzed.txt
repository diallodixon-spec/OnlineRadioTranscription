20251225 151707 We had a lot of fun. We knew we were faking. Love was not impressed with our connection. Built on lies, on lies. So I'm here because I found this one thing is true. That I'm nothing without you. I know better now now And I've had a change of heart I'd rather have bad times with you Than good times with someone else I'd rather be beside you in a storm Than safe and warm by myself I'd rather have hard times together than to have it easy at all I'd rather have the one who holds my heart
