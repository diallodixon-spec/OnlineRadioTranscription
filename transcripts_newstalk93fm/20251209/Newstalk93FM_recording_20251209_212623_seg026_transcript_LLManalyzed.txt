============================================================

Just don't act like my love wasn't nothin' Like I wasn't the one you was holdin' that night Tellin' all of your secrets and huggin' Guess you right, it's too good to be true What's important, all I needed was you But time after time, I just fussin' and fightin' It's time that you do what you do And it's cool, mama said it was fishin' to see I got lost in the pool Knew it was comin', I watched how you moved How you turned leave me baby go and leave me all the way. Don't ask for all your things back cussing out my name, yeah, just to go and take back what you say. Burn all the bridges. Don't ask forgiveness. Walk away like I'm sorry.
