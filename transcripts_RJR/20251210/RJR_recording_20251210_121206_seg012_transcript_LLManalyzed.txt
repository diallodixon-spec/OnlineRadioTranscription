Good afternoon, I'm Christopher Scott and we bowl off this lunchtime sports report with some cricket. As Sheik Hope says the West Indies tail let them down on day one of the second test in Christchurch after the visitors were bowled out for just 205. Hope topscored with 48 while Jamaica's John Campbell added a solid 44 but the lower order couldn't push the total further. Blair Tittner was the pick of the New Zealand bowlers with 4 for 32 while Michael Ray backed up backed him up with three wickets. In reply the hosts made a composed start reaching 24 without loss at stumps to set a steady platform for day two.
