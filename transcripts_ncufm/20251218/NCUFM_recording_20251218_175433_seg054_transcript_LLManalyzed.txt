It's very easy, because at one point I was also in the US, it's very easy for you to lose focus and want to shop, you want to buy a car. I didn't do any of those. When you migrate, most times the hospitals will give you a rent check. I found myself an apartment that was at the value of the rent check, so nothing came from my salary towards that. I found an apartment that was near to the bus route. So I walked out like for one minute and I'm right at the bus stop. I took the bus to work.
