Yes, everybody has to come from the community. He came from Williamsville, Mas Danzy. With the um, what's the ice name? Dry Ice. Dry Ice. Yes. Put it our hand make it burn away dry but no the fudge man was from out of town or out of port they call it come from some other community he was in williams which is two and a half miles from where i grew up was an adjoining community i'm not even so. We never really call him fudge man. I think we call him ice cream man. However, there was an ice cream man in the community who would make ice cream from, I think, milk and the same dry ice.
