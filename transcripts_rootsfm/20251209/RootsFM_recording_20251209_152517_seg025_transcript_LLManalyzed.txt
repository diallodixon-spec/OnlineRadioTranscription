You couldn't be the girl for me Now I can't see I thought you were special Only girl for me You've been telling me lies I'm foolish all out of my head Oh for me. Couldn't be the girl for me, na, na, na. Couldn't be a girl for me. Got you for the second time with another guy. Girl, you never learn. You look me in the eyes, telling me you're paralyzed. Oh, when you walk, oh, learn.
