20251215 092317 beginning, but you know that your intention is clean and pure. And that's what I want to commend to all of us as Jamaicans this morning. We know that our brothers and sisters in the western part of the country in particular have been battered, bruised by Hurricane Melissa. Please continue to do what you can to ensure that they get their life become a little brighter going into the end of the year. There are so many others not just in Western Jamaica but across the country who are having much difficulty. They were having difficulty before and it has been exacerbated after the hurricane Melissa because so many avenue of hustling as it were has been truncated. So we are aware of that.
