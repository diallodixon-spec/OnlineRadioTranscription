20260102 190004 thought that i would grow so weary the love gets better now my girlfriends they see it too the glow on my face is because of you right when you're not around I close my eyes and fantasize Thought he'd be sweet So sweet, so sweet, so sweet Every time he passed me skinned me teeth We had the melody and he made the beat So we'd wait Waiting for the right one is the hardest thing I've done If I knew that you were right there then I'd never write this song
