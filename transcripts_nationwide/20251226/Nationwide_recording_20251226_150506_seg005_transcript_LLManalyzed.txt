20251226 150506 I'm trying to keep it together But I'm falling apart I'm feeling all out of my element I'm gonna be going out of your mind Trying to figure out where the hell I went wrong The chemistry was crazy from the get-go Neither one of us knew why We didn't do nothing over night cause Our love like this takes some time Nationwide, 90% For love as a face, said we can't see that Now from top to bottom, they say that we can't see it Nationwide And I'll be waiting up until you get home Cause I can't sleep without you
