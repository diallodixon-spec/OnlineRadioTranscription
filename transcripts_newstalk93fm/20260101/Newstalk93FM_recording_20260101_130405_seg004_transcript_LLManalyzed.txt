Let us always look out for our neighbor, support local businesses and industries, and be generous to those most affected by the impact of the hurricane. Let us carry forward the lessons of 2025 and always be guided by the truth that we are stronger when we support one another. On behalf of the entire opposition, I extend warm New Year's greetings to you all. May 2026 be a year of healing, renewal, and collective progress. Walk good, stay hopeful, and may God bless Jamaica, land we love. The preceding was a New Year's message from Leader of the Opposition, Mark Golding.
