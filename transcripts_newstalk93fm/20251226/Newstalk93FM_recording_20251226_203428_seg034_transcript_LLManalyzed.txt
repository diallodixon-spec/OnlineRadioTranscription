20251226 203428 You can stay inside it Can you blow my mind? Set it off my whole body If I give you my time Can you search my soul from it? I don't wanna wait Don't take it Take me where I ain't been before Can you blow my minds? Make me sweat, make me hotter Make me lose my breath. Make me water, make me sweat it. Make me harder. Make me lose my breath, make me water. Make me sweat it, make me harder.
