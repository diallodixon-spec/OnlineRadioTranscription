============================================================

The best life goes to you For making me believe That you could be faithful to me Let me hear your speech out How about a round of applause? A standing ovation Even if you were a million miles away, I could still feel you in my bed. Near me, touch me, feel me. And even at the bottom of the sea, I can still hear inside my head. Telling me. Touch me. Feel me.
