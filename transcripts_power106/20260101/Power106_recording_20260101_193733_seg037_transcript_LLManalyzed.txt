20260101 193733 It could last forever in this love that we feel Sometimes your dreams seem like a perception to someone else you believe If I ever forget to hold your hand Always remember it doesn't mean I don't understand Child love is our strength Together we're resilient And there is always a place to lay your head Never replace this love with anything Your love is my strength
