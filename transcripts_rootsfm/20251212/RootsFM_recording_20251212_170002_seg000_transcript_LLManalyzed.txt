20251212 170002 I'm on the road, just changing. I'm ready to roll. I love how you're shaking, floating around the floor. I'm not scared of danger. Let's get by the door. Girl, I love your vibe. Where do we begin? I won't really like it. I remember wanna be your friend. You're looking so nice. I'd like to know you, don't tell me no My main attraction, not a side show You give me that smooth sailing friendship We got something that's so authentic Loving your style is so not basic We got the time now, let's not waste it Girl I wanna keep you real up front with your big friends With any bits of me run through your body
