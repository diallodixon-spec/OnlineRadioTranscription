I love the fact that Nigel Warmington has given us a new word, which is nincompoop. All right, what have I got here? Simon, why is the PM in New York? Who is he meeting? The release says official business, so the public has a right to know. By contrast no one needs to know any more details about Dr. Chang's surgery unless it left him incapacitated in which case he would just need to resign. Well, it happened the last time, or one of the times when the PM went away, and I tried to find out on what occasion, and there was no information.
