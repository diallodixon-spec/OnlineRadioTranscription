According to the Honorable Karencia Morrison, State Minister and Minister of Culture, Gender, Entertainment, and Sport, the celebration will be a moment of inspiration and a testament to Jimmy Cliff's impact on Jamaica and the world.

Jimmy Cliff, who passed away on November 24 at the age of 81, was a seven-time Grammy nominee and two-time Grammy winner. He was known for his unique music and message, which spanned racial, religious, and cultural boundaries. His songs, such as "The Harder They Come" and "Many Rivers to Cross," have become anthems of empowerment and inspiration for people around the world.

She noted that Jimmy Cliff's music has been a powerful force in shaping the thinking of the world and has inspired people from all walks of life.

The official celebration of Jimmy Cliff's life will feature a number of artists, including Tessanne Chin, Bright Richards, Tony Rebel, Luciano, Etana, Dean Fraser, Nadine Sutherland, and Bill Mann, among others. The event will also include video tributes from Shaggy and Ziggy Marley. Minister Morrison encouraged all Jamaicans to attend the event, which will be open to the public, and to tune in to the live stream on the Jamaica Cultural Development Commission's pages online.

The celebration will be a moment for all Jamaicans to come together and honor the legacy of Jimmy Cliff, who was not only a legendary musician but also a world citizen who inspired people around the globe. As Minister Morrison noted, Jimmy Cliff's music and message will continue to live on, inspiring future generations to come.

In the words of Jimmy Cliff's iconic song, "You can get it if you really want, but you must try, try, and try, you'll succeed at last." The official celebration of his life will be a testament to the power of his music and the impact it has had on the world.
