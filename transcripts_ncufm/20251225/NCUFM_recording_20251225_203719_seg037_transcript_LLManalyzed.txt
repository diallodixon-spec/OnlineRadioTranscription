20251225 203719 groups, churches and charities who moved quickly to help those who were badly affected and to Jamaicans overseas who reached out and sent support back home. We are grateful to you. May God bless you all this Christmas. Christmas in Jamaica has always been about togetherness, the sounds of carols and oldies floating through the streets, the smell of Christmas cake, gunga peas and steaming pots, children running in excitement, families coming from near and far, the simple joy of good company, good memories, and that special Jamaican love. So even while we acknowledge the hardships of this season, it is important that we also celebrate what continues to make our island special as it gives us hope. Celebrate our resilience. Celebrate our creativity. Celebrate the friendships and community networks that have carried us year after year. Celebrate the challenges
