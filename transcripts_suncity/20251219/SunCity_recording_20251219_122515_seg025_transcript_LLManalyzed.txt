20251219 122515 I'm in a good mood, check this. All my life, I'm the one who wants to get rich. Diamonds on my bezel, diamonds all over my necklace Tryna do no wrong, but tell them how a crown woulda get wished If people take this, know them let it spread this Put in all the power, can't teach them to respect this My missus son, be careful, no be reckless I'll make them stray and edge the crown of yours and make them take this That's why I'm a bag, I'm a seagull in bags I'm a bag like the wicked and bad, yeah Sometimes I say say them, one of them world squad. But then my man, I say them, put that man up like the side of a truck. And they shoot me from up here. Give me the other fish up here. Partner, put your son on your side. Wait till me get my partner, yeah. I'll go buy him a mic.
