We are the wicked and the righteous things getting tougher So the father we are going for Father God help! Father God help! For all the youths and minors in the suburb, in the ghetto, in the slum now. We are the mothers who are here ballin' all aboard because of picnic day. We are the fathers, we are woks hard and still kept on the food we eat. We're here to see it in for your people, Father, help me now. The older people good times The nice times, the right times and even the fun times Never used to sing the songs with the gun rhymes The good old days when of the death and the front line All the babies and the sucklings make we come together And show the wise them how that's how we feel love one another
