20260102 214941 Oh for the past five days, did you check on me? Now did you look for me? I walked in the room eyes are red and I don't smoke banga Did you check on me now did you notice me? Nobody will know the paranoia Cause I put a smile on my face If I said you can never face And if you don't know me well at all You won really know. Cause you see people, people, people, they don't really know, they don't know. I've been drinking more, all for the past five days.
