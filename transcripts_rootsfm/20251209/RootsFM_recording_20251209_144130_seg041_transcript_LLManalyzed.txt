============================================================

I feel a ton of joy and my heart gets warm Thinking about you holding me, squeezing you in my arm But as the day turns to night loneliness gives me a fight I'm afraid to close my eyes, yes it's another sleepless night I feel a shiver baby, heart I'm a true believer, 96.1. You're done.
