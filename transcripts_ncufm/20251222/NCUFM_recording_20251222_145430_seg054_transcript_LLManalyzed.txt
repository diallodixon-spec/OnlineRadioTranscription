20251222 145430 Only hope is Jesus Hope has a name You see the view from where I'm standing Isn't all that I've imagined it would be My dreams and expectations were interrupted by reality.

And every moment I'll spend forever knowing Hope has a name, name has a face And when you look into his eyes all the love You will never be the same
