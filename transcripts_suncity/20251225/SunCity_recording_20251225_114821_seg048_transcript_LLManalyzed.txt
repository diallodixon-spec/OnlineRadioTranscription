20251225 114821 I really love someone I know it's right From the moment I wake up to deep in the night There's nowhere on earth I'd rather be than holding you to me I've been waiting for a girl like you To come into my life I've been waiting For a girl like you Who love and will survive I've been waiting On someone who can make me feel alive Waiting for a girl like me to come into my life
