20251219 091709 born or was born from many years ago yeah right from I was in school always wanted yeah always wanted to do transportation business my father was in transportation business so it was a natural way for me to just matriculate into transportation however doing transportation for over 25 30 years I noticed that look I really good at tourism, and tourism is our number one income earner for USD. Why not explore that option? So I branched out and created Fiwi Adventures, which basically complements the transportation part of the business, which is Fiwi Express. So you book Fiwi Express for transportation which is airport transfers and basically hotel pickups, pick you up at a resort, take you to all excursions and Fiwi Adventures takes care of all the bookings of the best excursions island wide. Oh wow okay so the next thing that I wanted to ask you
