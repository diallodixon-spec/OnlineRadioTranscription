20251219 124523 So everybody has to sing it out. I love my life, I love my life I love my life So I'm gonna live my life today Make a change, don't make nobody stress you Don't make no blood pressure make your life nephew Never you hurt a soul unless you Have to defend yourself if they try to test you Thank God for my life, yes I wake up this morning and alive, yes Make them go and judge nobody no perfect and Father God alone bring brightness If you don't like what I say, go find me Lord. I don't have time for the work of time so hard. They're not mad at me, I'm not going to psych a word. Or go join them all, enjoy my life of y'all. Few friends from me are with here to me. I don't trust people so I choose them carefully.
