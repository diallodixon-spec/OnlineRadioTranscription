20251217 140608 So let me see your hands up in the air, wave them up in the band. People from everywhere, welcome down to the land of the party. We love to party. Cause life is for the living, we live in it. A chance is to be given, so be given it. So don't be late, the truck can't wait. We are here to celebrate, I'm telling you Hard work without the smart work It's not work We don't want no batter that I need a little breather Two days on the road with some jam in the middle Divey come we need to find the middle For the sake of peace of mind So the middle of the road is clear You'll find me and my friend and them because We move so hard, so hard For a week, we serve a party
