20251216 175436 A faith that is firmly grounded in Christ The hope that endures for all time These are the basics We need to get back to the basics of life We've let the darkness It's made us too long We gotta turn the tide Oh, and we need the passion That burned long ago To come and open our eyes There's no room for compromise We need to get back to the basics of life A heart that is pure and a love that is blind
