Mrs. Barneswell says when they drove up to the man, she was able to positively identify the missing child who was being forcefully led by the man. She shared that when her husband called out I just didn't want him to flee. I get into this parental mode, rush towards him, and I tell him, I know we haven't got the people in Brittany. And he stopped, and I went up close to him. He learned three times. While I wanted to go learn to this, I wanted to learn to the next time. So I let the people in Brittany learn. And I said, will you get the people in Brittany? He said, cousin. I said, cousin, so yes. I said, who are you, cousin? What comes to cousin? Then he said, cousin sent him to the child.
