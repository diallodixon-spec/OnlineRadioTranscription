If it was up to me, I wouldn't give it nobody No sympathy, I'd take away the pain I'd give you everything I just wanna see, wanna see If this world would make love I can't lie, I trust you, I love you I won't waste your time, I turn it off Just so I can turn you on I'ma make you say love I'm not even trippin', I won't stretch you out I might even settle down for you I'ma show you I'm a pro I'ma take my time and turn it up Just so I can turn you on, baby Wiggins, get it poppin' on the low Better days comin' for sure What are you coming for? If this world were mad Shining
