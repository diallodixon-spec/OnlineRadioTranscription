Second place will receive $125,000, third place $100,000, and the remaining finalists will each receive $75,000. And you know, Chairman, I must say that these are just token cash amounts because if we really could, we'll give each of them a million dollars. Anyway, you know, you guys really have made us proud and you know, you continue to do well. All funds are provided via the Lascaux Gold Visa prepaid card and this ensures secure and easy access for finalists. Now on a personal note before I wrap up, I wish to commend Assistant Commissioner Charmin Chan.
