20251215 133129 I feel it coming Time is of the essence I try to teach you But I need some lessons I need to give it all I try to live but I can't I don't know why you're the one Drowning me out of my mind You don't need no other body Only you fit on my body Only you fit in my body You don't need any other body Say I need a mess up my mind And I need to make you free up my mind
