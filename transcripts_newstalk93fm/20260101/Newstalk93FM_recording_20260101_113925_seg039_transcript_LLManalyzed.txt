20260101 113925 I don't know about you, but I come here to fit. Come to play a mask. I'm not leaving until I wet. I don't live my don't live my life with regrets, no I come to jam on a bumper Come to drink out the liquor Until my head gone And I miss a rebel All down on the ground I'm causing trouble Look how the security watch me They don't know I'm out there And it's much of the place Under the defect like a jumbo And to one way They don't want me in there for I see them They don't want because I do One way They don't wanna me in there For I see them I don't listen nothing
