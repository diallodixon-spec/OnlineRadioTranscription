I wanted you Every part But I knew love would be complicated I began to judge But you wouldn't let it It never seemed to be the right time I started to give up Down to the limit And then you change your mind oh and we begin to rock steady steady rockin' all night long and we began to rock steady rockin' till the break of dawn Rockin' steady, steady Rockin' all night long Rockin' steady Rockin' til the break of dawn
