20251219 171311 I feel your frequency from miles away You come alive with one wine baby you, I want to dance the night away One jam, turn a lifetime, baby So don't feel away You don't like the fast life Look on the bright side, girl I go take the blame I just want you to come and bite the top Just a little winding up Come and meet me at the end of the truck and we rev it up Whole day, keep throwing it back at the wire stop Baby, no way we could break it down
