Be confident. Hold not thy peace, O Lord of thy praise. So the mouth of the wicked is open against me. They speak the lying tongue with word of hatred. They fight against me for thy love, when they shall judge, for I condemn thee with you, not to take them off his children before this. Why be with them, but in his bed out of this land place? Lord God, the exalted, catch them. Lord God, I pray. Lord God, let me touch this water, this bucket, this olive oil, these papers, O God. I pray, Lord God, that I may breathe upon it, upon it. Shoot the blood in there, God. Do you have another color? Run it through the seven seas in the mighty name of Jesus. I pray, Lord God, that you may cut and clear who need healing, who need help, who need deliverance. Lord God, who need strength, who need determination. Cover them on their blood. Touch the water that when it's drink, when they use it, that it be an angel of change and deliverance, a weapon, a mass destruction demon, it forces sources from the pit of hell to cramp uproot, to trample eternal, touch water, breathe upon it God, I pray to God they will get success, they will get help, they will get deliverance,
