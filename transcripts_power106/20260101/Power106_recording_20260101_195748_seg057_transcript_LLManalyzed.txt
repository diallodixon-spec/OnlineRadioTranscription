20260101 195748 I promise that I'll never leave it You can call me by my name I'll be there, yeah Anytime you need company As you navigate these streets You should know I'll never go too far Too far away I'll never leave your heart I'll always be there for you I'll never be too far away When the night comes, I will brighten your day Anytime when the road is dark With a long way to go You won't have to walk alone, I will take you home When you can't find your way, feeling lost in the storm You won't have walk alone, I'll take you home
