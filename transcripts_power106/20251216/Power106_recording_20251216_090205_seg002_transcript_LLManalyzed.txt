20251216 090205 When Christmas comes, when Christmas comes My baby if you spread love, someday it might be enough To heal each other one by one And we gon' get together and rejoice and pray And we gon gonna help the world become a better place. And we gonna sing and shout because the Savior made. Don't miss me. Because it's Christmas time. And together it's gonna be so nice Better than ever Because this gift of love Lasts forever
