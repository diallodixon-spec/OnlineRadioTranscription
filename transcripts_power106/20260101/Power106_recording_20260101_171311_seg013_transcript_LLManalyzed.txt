20260101 171311 Hey, baby, love is coming at you. So you better be prepared. Hey, yeah, hey, hey, hey. Newfound love is like a brand new toy. It fills you up. You want to burst with joy. When you're in love It's a wonderful thing Your mind at rest You wanna try your best Prepare a place in your heart That's where it all starts A place in your heart Make love your resort Open your heart and let these feelings in To deny these emotions would be like a sin On you with love and true love again
