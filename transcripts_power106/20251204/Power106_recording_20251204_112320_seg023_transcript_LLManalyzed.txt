I have a clip here, I don't know if people remember this. People like Smitty and Critic. But then they're probably supporting in this effort. This is what the man said a you know. And it's the one thing I will say to you about, Trump. Trump always tell you where I'm going to do. Trust me. It's like what them say, if she's an alligator down a river bottom, believe him. If him tell you what he's going to do or who he is, believe him. Say that kind of reverse credibility. And he's always been like that. He say we invade Iraq and we come out without the oil.
