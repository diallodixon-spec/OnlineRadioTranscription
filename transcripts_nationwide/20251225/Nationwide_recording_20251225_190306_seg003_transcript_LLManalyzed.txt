I also commend the media across radio, television, print, and digital platforms, who worked tirelessly, often under difficult and dangerous conditions, to keep the nation informed. Your responsible reporting helped calm fears, mobilize assistance, and connect families. Jamaica thanks you. Above all, we give thanks for our people, a people of faith, grounded in trust in Almighty God, and resolute in spirit. Jamaica has always risen, not because the world was easy, but because the people refused to give up. My fellow Jamaicans, this is not the time for division or destruction. We must remain focused on rebuilding our nation.
