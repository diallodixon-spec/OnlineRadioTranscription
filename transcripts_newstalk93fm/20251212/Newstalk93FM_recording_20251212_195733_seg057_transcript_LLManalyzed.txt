20251212 195733 Oh, this side of heaven's gate. Oh, my life, I'll do you. Breathe in, take my breath away. At your altar, I will pray. You're the smoke, I'm the clay. Oh, my, my, you're taking me out from the ordinary. I want you laying me down. So we're dead and buried. On the edge of your night. Staying drunk on your vibe. The angels up in the clouds are jealous. No one can bow. So this world is ordinary. You got me kissing the ground. Sanctuary. Share with me what You've done. Oh Lord, return me to dust. The angels up in the clouds are jealous, know what we've found. Something so heavenly, higher than ecstasy, whenever You're near.
