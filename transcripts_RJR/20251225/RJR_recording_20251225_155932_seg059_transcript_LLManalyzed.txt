20251225 155932 It's a rockin' Christmas time. Hey, a boom-a-lip-a-tay-a-da. A rockin' Christmastime. Hey, a boomin' lip-a-ta-ya-da. Walkin' on the E, you feel the Christmas breeze. They lightin' up the trees, crowd is up to the squeeze. Dancin' in the streets to the great reggae beat. Till a.m. 4 o'clock, I still a-lickin' back. It's a Rockin' Christmas Time.
