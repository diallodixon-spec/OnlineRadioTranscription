I'm singing like girl you know I want your love Your love was handmade for somebody like me Come and now follow my lead I may be crazy, don't mind me Say boy, let's not talk too much Grab on my waist and put that body on me Come and now, follow my lead I'm in love with the shape of you We push and pull like a magnet do Although my heart is falling too I'm in Love with your body Last night you were in my room And now my bedsheets smell like you Every day discovering something brand new I'm in love with the shape of you
