It's a Christmas time, Christmas time, oh when me hear them say. But oh what fun, it is to write on a New York city subway. Flashing through the snow, a pretty young girl I know. On and on we go, that's how our love will grow. If the music play, listen every word they say. Oh, what fun it is to ride on a New York City bus.
