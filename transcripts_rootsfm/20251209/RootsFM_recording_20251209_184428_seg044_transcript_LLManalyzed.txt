What is the point in starting something you can't continue with a broken heart? First they can't help you, so you've got to be sure from the start. From the start. For my heart is not made of unbreakable material. One thing about love, it's got to be mutual, or else someone is sure to be hurt. So don't think I'm vain These questions For love ain't a game No it ain't a game So if I gave my heart to you What would you do with it? Would you tear it apart, or would you look after it? If I gave my heart you, what will you do with it, would you tear it apart?
