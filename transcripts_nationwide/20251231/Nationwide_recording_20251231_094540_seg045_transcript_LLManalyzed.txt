20251231 094540 but I think there is a system in place to deal with bulky waste and I assume that's the procedure they're following. I can't speak specifically. I don't know if Mr. Audley Gordon is listening and can let us know if they're doing anything right with the amount of waste, but I'm assuming the NSWMA has dealt with bulky waste before and so they are following the procedures, that stuff. You know, I hear people say that all the time when you move a dump like what what do you do and and and i was saying to you no what i was saying the problem let me have with it when you're driving past a dump i see on the left hand side going to spanish town
