Lord, you took my by the hand, place me on a rock, for me to stand, say. God of peace, God of love, the one who reigns From above, I'll fall for me You're my king, you made everything, oh lord When you speak, things are done And when when you move, demons run. No one can stand in your way. Eternal daddy, eternal daddy, eternal daddy.
