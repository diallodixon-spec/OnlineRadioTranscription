But all the love will show, because everybody knows it's Christmas time, year for the family. It's a wonderful feeling, with a loving room from the floor to the ceiling. It's that time of year. Christmas time is here. And with the blessings from above, God sends you His love. And everything's OK. Merry Christmas. Happy holiday. Oh, yeah. Merry Christmas.
