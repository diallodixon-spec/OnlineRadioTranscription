20251224 174117 I say this sucker is my therapy. Therapy, my therapy. Can't take away all of my anxiety. Anxiety, my remedy. I tell you that we all need love. Jump up and show me love. Wait up show me love. Together, say we all need love! Jump up show me love, wait up show me love! Sucker make we stronger together. No place that I'd rather be. Stronger together. Only you can help me understand it You and you alone speak my language And I try my best to keep my head up Every day I get stronger and stronger, I feel it
