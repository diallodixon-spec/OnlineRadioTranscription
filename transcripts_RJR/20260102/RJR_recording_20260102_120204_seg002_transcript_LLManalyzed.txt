20260102 120204 I extend sincere appreciation to the men and women of the Jamaica Constabulary Force, the Jamaica Defense Force, the Major Organized Crime and Anti-Corruption Agency, our correctional officers, border security teams, and all partners across the national security architecture. Your collective efforts have changed the trajectory of our nation, placing us firmly on the path to long-term, sustainable crime reduction. This achievement belongs to all Jamaicans. Together, let us protect this hard-won peace and press forward to what we can and must become, a safer and more peaceful Jamaica. Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of National Security and Peace, Dr. Horace Tang. In the meantime, Indicum Commissioner Hugh Faulkner has welcomed the decrease in murders last year. He is maintaining that the Commission cannot establish a connection between the low murder rate and the increase in fatal shootings.
