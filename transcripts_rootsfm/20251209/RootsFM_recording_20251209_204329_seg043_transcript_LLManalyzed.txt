When the word is on your shoulder Gotta straighten up your act and book it down If you can't end with a feeling Then there ain't no room for you this part of town Cause we're the party people night and day Living crazy, that's the only way So tonight Gotta leave the nine to five up on the shelf And just enjoy yourself Groove, let the Madison, the music get to you Like it's so bad at all If you're living off the wall Right face, suffering in my mind
