I, just like you, I would love some clarity as to the way forward beyond that 150 million U.S. initial put forward by the government. That 150 wasn't provided by any foreigner. We are providing that to the JPS, as in the taxpayers are providing that to the JPS as in the taxpayers are providing that 150 to JPS and then still um attribute to to to to high um cost of living uh as in JPS still contributes the high cost of living i'm not sure what you mean no like if we do that if we really um pay JPS that from all the question, my brother. I can't ask that question at all.
