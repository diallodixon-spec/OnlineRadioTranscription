20251222 174328 So what was it? You were on campus as well the night Melissa hit? Yes, I was on campus. What was that like? Well, it was a traumatic couple of hours. But I think we coped as a team together because we took part in different activities. Even when the storm was happening, we were juggling toilet paper. Everything was happening. So we were trying to build each other and ensure that everyone was OK. Deandre, what has it been like leading the team over the past month when I'm sure that some or many of your team members have been affected by Melissa or families have been affected, roof gone, all kinds of things? How did you help to hold them together? Well, it was a joint. Everybody had to come together to hold the team together, coaches, and what helped us that we were together so no one was away or the same people from me was affected by it. We were all together.
