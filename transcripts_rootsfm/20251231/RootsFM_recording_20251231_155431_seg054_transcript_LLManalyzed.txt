20251231 155431 is telling me better off alone. After midnight, morning will come. Every day we'll see if it will get some. They say the girl, you know she act too tough, tough, tough. But it's gonna turn off the light, turn off the light. They say that girl, you know, she act so rough, rough, rough. But it's going to turn off the lights, turn off the lights. I say, follow me, follow me. Follow me. Down, down, down, down. And you'll see all my dreams. Looked above the other day Because I think I'm good and ready for a change I live my life by the moon If it's hot, lay low, if it's hot, let's go slow And if it's cold, let it go But after midnight
