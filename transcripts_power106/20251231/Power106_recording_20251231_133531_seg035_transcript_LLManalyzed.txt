20251231 133531 We could fly so high and let our spirits never die. In my heart I feel you are all my brothers. Create a world with no fear. Together we'll cry happy tears. So the nations turn their swords into blotches. We could really get there if you cared enough for the living Make a little space To make a better place Make it a better place For you and for me And the entire human race There are people dying If you care enough for living Make a better place for you and for me
