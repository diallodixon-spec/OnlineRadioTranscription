20251215 203424 Thank you for an unforgettable night. We will see you next time. Give it up for the band. And the dancers. And of course, Sabrina. I love you, Taylor. That's our show. We love you so much. Good night. They want that yacht life under chopper blades They want those bright lights and Balenci shades And a fat stock with a baby face They want that complex female character They want that critical smash ponder oar And an Oscar on their bathroom floor
