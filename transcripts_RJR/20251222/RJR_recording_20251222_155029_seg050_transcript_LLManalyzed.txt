Because it's Christmas, you know what I mean? You want to make sure you have this right and that right and that right. And you just end up tired and drained by the end of the year. And that drain might also be your pocket too. That's why, that's why you have to follow my lead, you know. Wait, what's that, Dilly? You have to choose between Christmas, birthday or Valentine's Day. One gift. Even if they're not close to each other? Yeah, one gift. So even if, even if birthday is April? Yeah. One gift for the year. God, even if... Wimes day, so... One gift of the year, so you have to pick. And my advice, don't tell yourself to pick your birthday, you know? Yeah. You know? Yeah. Yeah, that day they don't really have no great significance to you. That explains the turnover ratio.
