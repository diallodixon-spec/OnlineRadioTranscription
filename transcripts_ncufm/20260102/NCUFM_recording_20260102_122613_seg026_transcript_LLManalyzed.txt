20260102 122613 If I could speak honestly, it don't feel good. The rolling never does, it don't seem fair. For you to call this love, but if necessary pain is the ingredient for change. Even if I may be little sweet, it's working. Just for me all the moments i missed that one just for me because i chose not to wait patiently for every mistake was the same amount of grace that kept my blessing waiting just for me. But trusting your timing is not easy.
