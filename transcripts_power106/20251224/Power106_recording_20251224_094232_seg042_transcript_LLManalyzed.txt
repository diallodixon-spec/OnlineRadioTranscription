20251224 094232 JPS essentially maybe only have about less than 200 megawatts that they own. How that is factored in terms of the cost for generation, I don't know. It's a blurred vision here. But I don't see, if you give, start the area by the lights tomorrow morning. Because, I mean, the South Koreans have no, which is a government entity, they have 40% of it. it's not like it's a private sector company of JPS When people talk they must remember that JPS is owned 40% by East West which is a government company Yeah man, we have always been reminded of people who buy that So 60% of the company is owned by governments So this notion about it is a private sector run business is not correct. It's a partial private sector. But the issue of the transmission and distribution license, there is very little wiggle room to reduce from 40 cents US.
