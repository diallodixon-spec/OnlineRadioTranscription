20251231 193938 Number 11, First Offense, written by Dane Dawkins. Peter John Passard has done very little wrong in recent times. First Offense, finished two lengths fifth to generational, with a tag of 500. For a tag of a million, comes in with a tag of five hundred. He'd be the biggest threat of them all, and I'm expecting number 8, Magical Moon, to also be something of a threat as well. But the 11th first defense, although said to carry 126 pounds, gets my vote. There's a horse that I should have mentioned, number 12 Conundrum, with a good break, could be around at the finish line. It's a pretty good draw here, drawn on the outside.
