Here are some reminders from the Jamaica Customs Agency to assist you with your clearance. Ensure you have a valid copy of the certificate of registration from the Department of Cooperatives and Friendly Societies, a letter of authorization, if applicable, the signed special declaration, the bill of lading or airway bill, your packing list, your invoice or receipts, a valid tax compliance certificate, and the relevant permit and licenses, if applicable. Also ensure that shipments are consigned to the charity at the registered address factor that determines success or failure.
