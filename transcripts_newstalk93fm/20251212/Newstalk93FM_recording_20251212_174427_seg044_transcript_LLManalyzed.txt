20251212 174427 I know better, it not easy Time testing but I'm strong With love on my mind, love in my thoughts carrying on Why nobody no believe, in a love again Because every love then lost, nobody no believe in a love again Because every love that lost Nobody no believe in a God again Seems our faith is lost Nobody no believe and it hurts more Turn the lights on, the world's so dark Still I believe that love is everlasting. Yes, I know. Love is everlasting. I believe love is everlasting. I know love is everlasting.
