20251229 184223 some very good advice, which I use in my own business. So I don't need to be the best mechanic to have the best garage. What I need to do is to hire the best team of mechanics so that I can have a good garage. So what I'm good at is I'm good at the marketing. I'm good at this strategy. I am good at the planning and good at the business development. I leave a good mechanics to do their work. And so together that teamwork, we're able to get it done. And we've redefined the space in terms of the quality of the work that we do. I'll tell you this, we started with 14 people on October 18, 2022 was when we opened the garage and we had 14 customers on our first day. Within the space of two years, our current customer database is 500. And this is through no social media marketing, this is through not buying any ads on radio, none of that.
