20251212 151610 Plan, plan. Yeah, man. Who knows, who knows, who knows? I just go with a draping dose. Sending love to my friends and foes. And I suppose I'm pleased to be chilling in the West Indies. To provide all my wants and needs. I got the sunshine, rivers, and trees. We live the world. And I say we just move along. Move along. Yeah, man. Move along. We just move with time, time. And give time to love. You'll see that smile.
