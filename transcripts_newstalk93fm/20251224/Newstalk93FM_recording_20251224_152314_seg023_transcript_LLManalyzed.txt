20251224 152314 Rockin' around the Christmas tree at the Christmas party pop. Missles all hung where you can't see. Every couple tries to stop. Rocking around the Christmas tree. Let the Christmas spirit ring. Later we'll have some pumpkin pie and we'll do some caroling. You will get a sentimental feeling when you hear our voices ringing. Let's be jolly, deck the halls with boughs of holly. We're rocking around the Christmas tree. Have a happy holiday. Everyone dancing merrily in a new old-fashioned way.
