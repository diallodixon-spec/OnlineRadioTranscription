20251229 214120 I ain't even started yet. So if you ain't ready, you better get ready. I know I do it better when I'm being imposed. I stick your chest, I keep your chin up. Sometimes you got to get knocked down to get up. You keep bumping me against the wall. Yeah, I know I let your side of the phone. But until you see me, trust me. You ain't seen a boxer back into it. I can think again. Cause when it's think or swim, you got to think or win.
