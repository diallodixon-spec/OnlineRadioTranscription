I can call you my baby, boy. You can call me your baby, girl. Maybe we can spend some time. Love. I know you want to chill with a player But all you gotta do is keep it real with a player Just answer your phone whenever I call Cause I'm riding on chrome whenever I ball I like them short and tall but not too thick I just walk in the spot and take my pick And they wanna roll cause they like my style and when i pop my collar i make them smile i need a lady on the streets but they know how to cook cuz like to eat spaghetti shrimp and steak and i'll adore you i treat you like milk i'll do nothing but spoil you sunshine i could call you my baby boy you could call
