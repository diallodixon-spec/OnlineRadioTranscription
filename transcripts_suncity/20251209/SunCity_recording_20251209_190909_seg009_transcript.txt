This is not just one day, which is a Sunday. This is every day of the year. You need to be there mentally, protector, physically, provider, spiritually, guidance. Every day of the year to grow that full child, to grow that perfect flower. So fathers, just remember, the first trinity and the only true trinity is a mother, the father, and the child. You need to be there in your child's life.
