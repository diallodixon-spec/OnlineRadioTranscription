me my orange juice. Reach over and hold me baby. Just like that, just like that. We're gonna be making love all through the day and night. Oh, you like it baby. Hope we never get tired. And I never have to go to work. No one knocking on the door is distracting my notice. There's a time. No, baby, no, baby, cryin' at it. No heart in the way.

Oh, baby, you're right. Oh, baby.
