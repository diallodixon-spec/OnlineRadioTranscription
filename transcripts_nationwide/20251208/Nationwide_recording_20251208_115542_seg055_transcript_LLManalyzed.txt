My neighbor put it there without my permission. I call KCC. Put it where? At the fence side, in front of my house. The where? In front of my house, on this tree fence side. It is an endurance. I call the KCC. They put it there from the 16th of October. And I saw KCC. They came and they put a sticker on it. It's 12th of November. Three days to move it. And now it's not moved. And I've been going down to KSC. In terms of the Mayagin Consent, they put it there. I went back down there and I see the engineering secretary. I forget what his name is, and she was saying that she's going to send back our team. And she's saying what? Okay.
