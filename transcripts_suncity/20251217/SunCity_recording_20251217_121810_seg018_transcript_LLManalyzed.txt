20251217 121810 Life walk away from trouble, stay away from strife. Life is to live to the best in life. You only live once, you not live twice. You follow the road on the righteous path, still focus and just put your thoughts aside. Don't let the wicked corrupt your heart. Do the right thing, become the worst, yes or yes all. Take away yourself from trouble, from trouble. Because it come in a double. Take away yourself, from trouble. Rebuilding Jamaica.
