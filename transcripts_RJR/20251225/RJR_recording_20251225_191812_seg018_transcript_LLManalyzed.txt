20251225 191812 A beautiful sight, we're happy tonight. Walking in the winter wonderland. We'll hug and we'll kiss. Guess what? We'll make love. This is 94.5. I know my love it's Christmas time And nothing can I give you More than all the love that's mine to be For every day we live through This Christmas Eve will be Christmas carols and harmonies
