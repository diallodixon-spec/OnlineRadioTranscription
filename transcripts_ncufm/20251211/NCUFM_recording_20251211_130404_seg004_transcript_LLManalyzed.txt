You're killing to your body now She's killing to her body now You're, you're, you're an animal She's killing to the body now It's being a lie, you're gonna leave Oh my brother, my sister, please I speak for many whose lips are sealed. They are too broken, need to be healed From injustice, many a pain Recurring again and again I can't breathe
