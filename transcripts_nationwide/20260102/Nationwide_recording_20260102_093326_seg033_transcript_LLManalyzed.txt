20260102 093326 I know it will be a sad day. I don't think you can eat anymore. I think you need to drink some water. That's it. Drink some water today man. No more ham. I mean people just specialize in birthdays and things like that. So if you like my birthday now, you know I say I'm supposed to cut off some of that Christmas tree today. I wonder if we can meet him downstairs and flower him.
