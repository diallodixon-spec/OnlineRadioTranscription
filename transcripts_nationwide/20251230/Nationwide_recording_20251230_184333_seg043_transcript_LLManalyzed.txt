20251230 184333 and the cost of building a network and a lot of it is area. All right. Thank you so much for your time, gentlemen. Really appreciate it. Bjorn Spence is the Legal and Regulatory Director at Digicel and Charles Douglas is the Head of Government and Regulatory Affairs at Flow, Jamaica. Have a good afternoon. Appreciate your time. Good afternoon. All right. You know, Siobhan, I've always said that the kind of acts that we see when, you know, these criminals attack the network, I consider it a form of terrorism, you know, because of the number of people affected, as you rightly said, how it affects prospects for investments, how it affects productivity, business. It has to be an attack. It's an attack on people and also on the state itself. This type of infrastructure attack would not be taken lightly in places such as the United States and the United Kingdom because it has significant impacts on the development of the country. Absolutely. I consider it a form of terrorism so I actually welcome the fine of up to five million dollars and I would actually support it being more.
