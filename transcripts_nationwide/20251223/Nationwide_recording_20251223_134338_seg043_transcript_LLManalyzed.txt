20251223 134338 Thank you for loving me Treat my silly lies and alibis used to by me Yes you did So many nights you cried yourself to sleep Never knew the life I lived was making you weak Because of me you couldn't even eat only the lord knows. Baby girl, me and you would never part. Girl, me say you have me.
