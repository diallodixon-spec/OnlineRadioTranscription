============================================================

God is always there for me No matter what the circumstances may be God is always there For me Through the good times or through the bad Through the happy times or through the sad, God is always there for me. The landlord wears the grant, school feeds you, partner draw bonds, and you them meet you. Friends all hands with me, what I'm gonna do? I smile and tell them that God will see me through No matter what the circumstances may be God is always there for me
