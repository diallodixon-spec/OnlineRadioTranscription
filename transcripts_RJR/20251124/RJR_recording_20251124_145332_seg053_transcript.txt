============================================================

Today is the first day students are returning. Are they returning? Are they able to come based on what you've observed? How are they doing? and so forth. They are timetabled for their classes that they are preparing for exams. On a whole, we weren't able to prepare for them a cook meal because we don't have water and of course we don't have the fridge to suck away the meat and so forth. But we have the drinks and snacks and so that we could sell them. But they enjoy their little time there from 8.30 to 1.00.
