20260101 133013 Love, like a road that never ends How it leads me back again To a heartache I don't understand Darling, I put my heart upon the shelf Till the moment was right and I killed myself Next time I fall in love I know better what to do Next time I fall In love And next time I fail It's lovers Thursdays on Sun City 104.9 FM
