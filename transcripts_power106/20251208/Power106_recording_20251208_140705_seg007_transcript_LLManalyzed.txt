I'll be people and dress up in a wifey go hit up jobs to end gay it is no wonder He's a perfect finder While they were dancing in that bar room outside In a room of pride Mama said she must wipe her eyes Well, for the sake of it, pull it tight She never been to school at all it is no wonder Oh Just so you know, my friend Monkeys say you must pull up your head Monkeys say don't be fooling around It's not time for this wedding day It is no wonder He's a perfect wonder Why they were dancing in the night
