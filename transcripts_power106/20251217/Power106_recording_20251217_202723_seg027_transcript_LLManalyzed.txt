20251217 202723 Grateful. There are so many little ways we can do it. Or if you're not a person who likes to talk somebody, vent your feelings on a piece of paper, write out all of what you're feeling. Or just talk to the room. Yeah. But get it out, don't hold it all in. And so just getting it out helps to release it. And that too will help you not to be so overwhelmed. Be thankful, just a letter for the small things. down sometimes three to five things that because each little section kind of small you know some days you want to really full up a number of pages but we will limit ourselves so I find things that I am very grateful for
