20251217 165648 I want to thank you guys for spending the afternoon with us. You know I always like to say I know you have a choice and the fact that you choose to be Two Life family. We couldn't be more grateful and we are so thankful that you spent today with us. I want to thank Dr. Stefan Neal, Chief Medical Director at Critical Care Comprehensive Center for giving us those tips know, those tips about men's health. Very important tips. Ladies, most important tip was... Support. Yeah. Yeah, support. Guide them into it. Not cost them, not force them. Gentle push. It's not a word. Gentle nudge, yes. Provide the information as best as you can and hope that they will act on it. I also want to thank Anna Palamina, Anna the Money Coach, a great conversation about money mistakes and how we can recover for 2026 which is not going to be a broke year. No, no, I'm taking that out of the lexicon that out long time. Out. Anna says she's going to retire soon so
