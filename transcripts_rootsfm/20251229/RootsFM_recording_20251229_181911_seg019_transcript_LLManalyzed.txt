20251229 181911 You say you want me, need me, love me baby, just as I am. Just as I am. Take it slow, take it slow. Take it slow. Girl, I'm in love with you. This ain't the honeymoon. That's the infatuation phase. Right in the thick of love. At times we get sick of love. It seems like we argue every day. And though I misbehave, and you made your mistakes, and we both still got room left to grow. And though love sometimes hurts, I still love you.
