20251217 103124 Welcome to Healthy Alternatives, cruisers, where we share quick, easy, healthy and delicious plant-based recipes. We have a series of Healthy Alternatives planned for you this holiday season. If you were with us last week or if you follow us on Instagram, you would see that we are collaborating with Eden's Valley. They make delicious vegan friendly foods that are easy to prepare and made from real food ingredients. They're partnering with us to make all the food you would normally eat at this time of year, but a healthier alternative. Please help me welcome Mr. Alton Scott. He is the managing director at Eden's Valley. Good morning to you, Mr. Scott. Good morning. All right. So what are we making today? Well, today we want to do our Eden's veggie corned beef lasagna. Hey, wow.
