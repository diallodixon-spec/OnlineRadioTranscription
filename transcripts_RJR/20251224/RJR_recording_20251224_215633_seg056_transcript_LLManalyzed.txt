20251224 215633 So hard to live your life when you gave it up, baby For the fans and the cameras, eh Different places and adventures, eh And the stress that it brings, I don't wonder if it's worth it, eh I live life like it's perfect, my children are smiling And that makes me happy, baby Cause how I was living, I swear it had me Bows to my head on the wall My kids give my life with no You won't fall, no, you won't fall. You will rise above it all. You'll find what you're searching for. You may feel like winning. You think you're gonna hear the floor. Instead, you'll rise above it all, oh. Oh, oh, oh, oh.
