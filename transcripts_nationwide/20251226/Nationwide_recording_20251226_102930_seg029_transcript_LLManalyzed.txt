Oh, we were born together, destiny Move on, boy I know this love we share lives to be yours Make it to my paradise Give me what I'm missing Send me to the highest high Take me up and away I've faced this love so many times Something always missing But I know that you've got the guy Take me up and away I know that my journey Will be filled with passion, love and pleasure
