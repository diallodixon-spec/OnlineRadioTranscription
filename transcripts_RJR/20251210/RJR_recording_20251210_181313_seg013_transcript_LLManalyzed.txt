when they're handing out heroes medals they remember this gentleman Mr. Barnswell these are the people who deserve the gratitude of the entire nation you know i should do a segment on that you know people in an office sit down and wait for whether it's Mr. Barnsville or anybody else you think should get a national award you know anybody can nominate people for national award you know so another time we do that but yeah if you see somebody whether any neighborhood or whoever and you think they need to get award what people i people think there is some award god out there that hands out national annals. Anybody can nominate, trust me. So another day, like I said, I'll do a segment on it so people can know what to do. And we also have another listener saying a miraculous heartwarming story. It's also noteworthy that Mr. Barnswell's daughter was with them, probably made the other child feel comfortable going with them, seeing another child of similar age. We have Clarky Best says congratulations to Councillor Barnswell by that great, brave move made by him.
