Thompson was sentenced on Monday for the July 2022 stabbing death of 23-year-old Kayla Hodgson in Tamarack, Florida. Thompson was found guilty of first-degree murder in October after a jury took just one hour to return its verdict. The case against the bauxite mining company Windalco over a 2019 fish kill in the Rio Cobra has been pushed to 16th next year. The trial resumed yesterday in the St Catherine Parish Court with the defence calling its second witness environmental consultant Andrean Jones who gave testimony about how samples are collected, proper pH testing and the chain of custody of samples among other things. The trial was set to continue today, but presiding senior parish court judge Desiree Alleyne indicated that she has a heavy roster and there is a lack of judges available to take on cases. And that's headline news at this time.
