20260101 210709 I made the right choice, no second thoughts Anything I go through, I know that you get me. Other nights, hard days. Your love is consistent, I know you never change. Ask me the question, I'll say yes. I wanna be your bride in a wedding dress. True has really made me see what you are meant to be I'm going for another night Ain't going nowhere, love is sad
