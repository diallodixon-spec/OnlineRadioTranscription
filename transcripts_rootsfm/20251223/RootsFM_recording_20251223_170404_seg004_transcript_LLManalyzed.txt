The court noted that the killing took place during a home invasion in the presence of several people, and involved the use of a firearm. While dismissing the appeal, the judges acknowledged that the six-year delay in resolving the case at the appellate level was unacceptable, and amounted to a breach of Smith's right to a hearing within a reasonable time.

The court therefore refused the appeal, but issued a public apology for the delay.
