============================================================

the principle of effective communication. Because regardless of personality clashes between supervisors and supervisors, the fact is communication is imminent in the workplace. So at the very core, you want to ensure that if you are being fair to the employee, the feedback is so specific, it is as time as possible. If you perceive that there's a breach, or if rather a supervisor perceives that the employee is not meeting a target, it's falling short, you bring it to the employee's attention from early, and you start to give them time to reform and to improve. And you check in on a time-bound basis to see where there is feedback. And you document it if it is that you're seeing that there's a persistent failure of that employee, quote unquote, and put an improvement plan. So just a performance improvement plan. Work with HR to get that performance improved.
