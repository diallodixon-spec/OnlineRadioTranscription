20251231 200204 I'm not going to do what I want I don't know why you need to feel like I don't believe what I want, hey So I'm gonna take a little drink I don't know what I want, I don't go crying, I don't feel like it I don't know if I want, you don't have time to argue with nobody. We just live in the good life every day. Say nothing go by the way. You don't know we everyday. We rip it up, we rip it up. We rush it up. We never pay bubble, I never pay back it. Everybody see we understand, we act it up.
