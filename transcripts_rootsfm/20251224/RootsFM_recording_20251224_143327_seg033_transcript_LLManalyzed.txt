20251224 143327 Someday all our dreams will come to be Someday in a world where men are free Maybe not in time for you and me But someday at Christmas time Someday at Christmas we'll see a land No hungry children and no empty hands One happy morning where people will share A world where people care Sunday at Christmas there'll be no tea All men are equal and all men have no fears One shining moment, one prayer away From our world today
