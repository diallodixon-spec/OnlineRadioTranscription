20260101 140103 I love the way that you bring a vibe With your hands them up in the sky Falling down and up in a time Wine and season again And we have the money to spend And friend, friend. Oh, yeah. Lord, me candy ball friend. Friend, friend, friend, yeah. Lord me candy ball friend, until we meet up again. Ah! Mm, everything gone sat, you know. Mm, the bag gone packed, you know. She dreaming to take a wine from me, cause she coming down to please. When she ram a vine, with your hands them up in the sky, what we drunk can happen at times.
