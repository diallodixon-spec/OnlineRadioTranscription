20251212 191512 I just want you to come and bite it up Just a little winding up Come and meet me behind the truck and we rev it up. Whole day, keep throwing it back at the way you stop. Baby, no way. We could post up all the pictures you want. When you're ready, I go over here. Darling, you go over there. But we could meet in the middle and start a bacchanal. Play in the middle, hey. What we gonna do now? Jam to a rhythm in the heat. I can't evil, but in the heat. Hey, what we gon' do know? Start a wine on it. I say compromise on it. Baby, spend time on it. Hey, I say compromise on me. Hey, can we talk it out?
