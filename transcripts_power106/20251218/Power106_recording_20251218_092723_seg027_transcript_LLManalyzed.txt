20251218 092723 in transfers from the Capital Development Fund which was created by the former Prime Minister Michael Manley during the 1970s. Normal GDP was originally projected at $3.289 trillion during the last fiscal year and the Finance Minister at that time Nigel Clapp was supposed to tell the world how he planned to finance it in March of last year but he never did so until October 8 after pre-selling some 12 years receivables from Norman Manley International Airport with a special purpose vehicle which is now on ratings watch negative by Fitch and the Moody's and then promptly jump ship for the IMF. The government is now projecting to spend 1.55 trillion during this fiscal year, 97 billion more than the revised 1.3 trillion spent last year and the original plan was to finance it to 949.49 billion in tax revenues, 139.82 billion in non-tax revenues, 4.9 billion in capital revenues, 5.96 billion in grants, 758.44 billion in loans and 812 million in transfers from the capital development fund but these numbers will have to be revised because of the impact of hurricane Melissa. Normal GDP was originally programmed at 3.482 trillion dollars that will also have to be revised.
