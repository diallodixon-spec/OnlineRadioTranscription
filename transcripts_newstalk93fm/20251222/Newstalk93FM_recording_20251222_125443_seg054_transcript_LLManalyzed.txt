20251222 125443 Yeah, I'm dancing So I began all day to like talk Animals stay in human form But demand nobody like work But you must hustle if you want job You know finish them off, fight off If them they run, them no feet catch up I know they from say I too I trust No come they from say you too like us Me no get the time for the hate and the bad energy Cause my mind don't mind money Me make you dance like broccoli Steady green like broccoli Steady on my grind, you won't hear what they want
