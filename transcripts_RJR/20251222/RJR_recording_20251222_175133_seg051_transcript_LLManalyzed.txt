20251222 175133 Captain DeAndre Wright-Barnett, Vice Captain Malik Wellington and they asked Captain DeAndre just before the break how had he helped to lead over the past month when the school was affected, community affected and many of the boys I'm sure coming from families also badly affected. Mr Wellington you are coming in. Yeah I wanted to add something I'm sure DeAndron coach and Malikian speak for themselves. But one of the things I want to use the opportunity to mention and to thank some other persons. So during the aftermath of the storm, we tried our very best to get up and running quickly. And so States became a hub for people, right? But we had a number of staff members who were affected, who came even though school had not resumed. They were there every day helping. But I want to especially mention three persons from the community, teachers too from another school, who was there every day. They were there until almost 10 o'clock.
