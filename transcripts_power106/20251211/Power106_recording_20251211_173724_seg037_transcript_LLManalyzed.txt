2025-12-11 18:54:31 There'll be no war When we have learned what Christmas is for When we have found what life's really worth There'll be peace on earth Someday all our dreams will come to be Someday in a world where men are free Maybe not in time for you and me, but With no hungry children and no empty hands One happy morning, people will share A world where people care Oh, Sunday at Christmas there'll be no tears
