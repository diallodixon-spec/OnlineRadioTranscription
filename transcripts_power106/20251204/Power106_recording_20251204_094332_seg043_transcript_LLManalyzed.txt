Let us look, first of all, background is key to all of this. When we look at the sort of support that we needed for what is happening since the hurricane, we see that this is $6.7 billion. Let us look at what it entailed. And you rightly put it in the right context. Where we're going to have $1 billion for priority areas, including technical support. Only $200 million, this is US dollars now, for infrastructure and small businesses support. So I do not see where this gonna is going to spur good. We also see for the city that has 1% state protection. Yes, so what we are having is we need the support. We have not heard from the minister. Listen, there is no way we are going to get the GD.
