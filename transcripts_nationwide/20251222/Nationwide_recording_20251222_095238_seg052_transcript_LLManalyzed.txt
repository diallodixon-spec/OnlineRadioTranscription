20251222 095238 Go read what news commentator J.A. said. We have another caller on the line. Dionne, good morning. Yes, good morning. Good morning to Opal. I'll never remember your name. Yes, just a quick question. Are you hearing me? Yes, we're hearing you. Good morning. Oh, yes. Just a quick question. Just to tell you our situation. Okay, so my son was in the United States last year. He went upon a visitor's visa, but somehow he was trying to get into school and so everything never worked out as we wanted it to in terms of the cash. So what happened, he stayed there, he went up July and he stayed up until, call it a day, he came down the first of January of this year.
