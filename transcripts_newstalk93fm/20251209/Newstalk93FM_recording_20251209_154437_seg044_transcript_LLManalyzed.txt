You survive through the night Through the darkest of times baguettes, got you feeling like you made it Everything advanced, nothing that I do is basic Me and Rolls Royce on a first name basis Look her with no chases Only give her hunnits cause she hates seeing new faces. Know she wanna mine by the stones in her bracelet. Little money, be a holler down station. She told me to pay her for it, now she backing it up. Used to date a Bob player, but they wrapping it up. Got her in a penthouse and I'm smacking it up. They gonna point you to the top if you asking for us.
