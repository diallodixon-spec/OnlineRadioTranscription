the money colleges are done no light no water all right so hopefully they can get that back all right this one says good morning sir the minister of local government made it clear that the new building code will come into effect next fiscal year i wonder why it's taking so long to have this code in place this new building code has been passed at the Billing Act 1918, six years, and Hurricane Melissa has gotten many to panic. The problem is not just having a building code it's having that code enforced I mean 1998 all right not 1998 either no 2008 that would have been anyway 2008 year 2018 yeah six years
