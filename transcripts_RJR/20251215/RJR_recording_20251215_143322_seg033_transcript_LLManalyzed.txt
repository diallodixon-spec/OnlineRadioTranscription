20251215 143322 a season of loss for many, personal loss, national challenges, moments that have caused us to pause and reflect. Today, we're not dwelling in sadness, but we want to walk, talk about how we honor loss, how we find strength in difficult moments, how we continue to move forward with purpose and hope. Joining us is Dr. Grace Kelly, educator, counselor, grief and bereavement therapist and author of Grieve If You Must. She will help us to understand how grief and motivation can exist or coexist and help us to navigate the space. We say good afternoon to Dr. Grace Kelly. Good afternoon Dr. Kelly. Good afternoon Johnny, how are you? Christopher Daly. Yes, yes I'm with Sir Kenneth
