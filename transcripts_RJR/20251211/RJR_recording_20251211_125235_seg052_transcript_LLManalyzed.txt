============================================================

to give listeners a sense of what I'm talking about. I have used the reference, Rolls Royce, or wish list to indicate or to characterize what the JPS is going seeking to do and what they would want to come away with from the grid, which is of course separate and apart, Mr. Powell, from what it would actually take to restore light to the people who are still without light. That being the $150 million Jamaican dollars that the government has loaned. $150,000 million United States dollars. Thank you for that. And as I said earlier, based on the indication given by the Energy Minister, we will be restored either at the end of January or worst case scenario, early February. That was conveyed at post cap and all I'm doing sir is reiterating that to the public at the press conference of post cabinet last afternoon.
