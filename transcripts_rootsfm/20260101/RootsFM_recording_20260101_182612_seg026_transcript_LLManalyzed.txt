20260101 182612 You know how the time flies Only yesterday was the time of our lives We were born and raised in a summer haze Bound by the surprise of our glory days I hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it I hoped you'd see my face and that you'd be reminded Definitely, it isn't over Never mind, I'll find someone like you I wish nothing but the best for you too
