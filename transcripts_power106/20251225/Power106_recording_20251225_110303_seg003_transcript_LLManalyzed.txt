20251225 110303 Like a lot like Christmas Soon the bells will start And the thing that will make them ring Is the carol that you sing Right within your heart Listen to the birds, how they're singing Listen to the wind, how it's blowing It's Christmas time again Yes, it is Christmas time again Yes it is Christmas time again Listen to the bells, are they ringing? Look up on the children, are they playing? It's Christmas time again
