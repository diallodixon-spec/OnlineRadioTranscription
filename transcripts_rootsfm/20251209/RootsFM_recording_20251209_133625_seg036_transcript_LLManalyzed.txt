Oh, no. Would you be in front of my face? Could love be something that I want to embrace? I'm not a king-size man. But you know it means a share with me. Say that I want to know your name. Let that makes my life complete When I find that girl I hold her down swear to God, she'll be the one that conquers me. My love is in control of me. Could it be my next journey? We love each other.
