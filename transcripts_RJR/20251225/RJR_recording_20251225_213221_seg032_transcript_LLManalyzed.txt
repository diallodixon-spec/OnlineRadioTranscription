20251225 213221 from the heart of the city I know where I'll be for Christmas and the thought excites me so away from all the cold of some distant foreign land i'll be where jamaican christmas breezes flow they tell me snow is pretty well maybe if what i know for sure it might be cold i would never never never be caught playing a cricket match on ice. In or out of form, I would be bold. In the West, in the West, every Christmas is a time for all to smile.
