Not the best yam anyway because that's the one that I love. You have sweet and Irish potato, You have oranges. Thyme. Yes, that is very good. And do you sell, do you marry the thyme to the scallion? Or people can come and get thyme alone and scallion alone. All right, excellent. Because some people like to bite like that. When you go, you want to get your Skelion with your time. So are you in farming as well or you just sell? I'm in farming at St Ann's. You're in St Ann? And how are things over there in St Ann? Did you all suffer any damage from the hurricane?
