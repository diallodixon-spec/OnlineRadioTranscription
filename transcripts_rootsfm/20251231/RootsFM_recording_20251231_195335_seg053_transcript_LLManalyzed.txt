20251231 195335 I see you by the hotel when I catch with the lovey-was. I can ride up on the corner with me and we're robby-was. Everybody is grabbing us and they're looking at us like they want to hurry, some stabbing us. But we jump in the circle, don't falter like miracles. Slap on the purple and be a terror to our family. So when they see me burn up the place, they may let me burn up the breeze. And when they see me turn up the place, he may let me turn up the breeze. I come from a different era Thundercats and He-Man and She-Ra Bad man is red like malaria And Diana from Themyscira Man with the big chin and era Means he was a lender or dealer Old school had the dorsal feeler Hacks my reg in cricket
