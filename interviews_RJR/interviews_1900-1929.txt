**Interview with Milton Walker, Janet Silveiro, and George Davis on Beyond the Headlines**

In a recent interview on Beyond the Headlines, host Dionne Jax-Millot sat down with Milton Walker, head of news and sports, Janet Silveiro of the Gleanel, and George Davis of Nationwide to discuss the biggest stories of 2025. The conversation began with a review of the top stories of the year, including the Jamaica Labour Party's historic win in the general election, the significant reduction in homicides, and the devastating impact of Hurricane Melissa.

Milton Walker highlighted the JLP's win as a major story, noting that it was the first time the party had won three consecutive elections. He also praised Dr. Horace Chang, the General Secretary of the JLP, as one of the most successful general secretaries in the party's history. Walker also discussed the reduction in homicides, citing a 43% decrease in 2025, and expressed hope that this trend would continue.

Janet Silveiro reflected on the impact of Hurricane Melissa, which she described as a "game-changer" for Jamaica. She noted that the storm had exposed the country's vulnerabilities, particularly in terms of infrastructure and poverty. Silveiro also praised the volunteer groups that had come to Jamaica's aid, saying that they had "taught us a lesson" in terms of disaster response and recovery.

George Davis discussed the Israeli donation to Jamaica's hurricane relief efforts, which he said had attracted a record number of views and interactions on social media. He noted that the story had sparked a global conversation about Israel's role in the world and how countries should respond to humanitarian crises.

The conversation also turned to the topic of politics, with the panel discussing the future of the People's National Party (PNP) and its leader, Mark Golding. Davis argued that Golding had done enough to prevent a "palace coup" but that he may still face challenges in continuing to lead the party. Silveiro noted that the election result demanded "serious reflection, accountability, and renewal" from the PNP, but that the context of the election, including the close margin and the party's significant gains, should be taken into account.

Overall, the interview provided a nuanced and in-depth analysis of the major stories of 2025 and their implications for Jamaica's future. The panel's discussion highlighted the complexity and interconnectedness of the country's challenges, from politics and crime to disaster response and economic development.
