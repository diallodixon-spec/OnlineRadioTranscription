20251222 102728 So Mr. Newman, the reason we're calling is this comment by the FTC about Uber and Indrive. First of all, just remind our listeners, Uber and Indrive, what is it that they do that is so different from what the other transport sector offer? Uber and Indrive has been those two hail groups, that are officially from other countries, and as they do in other Caribbean countries, in the United States, in England, they operate in a space where the PP we are operating, but they don't have the required license to operate in Jamaica. And for the past maybe five, six years, we have been talking to the government, the government has been talking to them. But I don't know why they are so strong in terms of their power, in terms of allowing, they've been allowed to operate without a license in Jamaica.
