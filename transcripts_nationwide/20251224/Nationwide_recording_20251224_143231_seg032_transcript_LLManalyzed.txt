20251224 143231 Ultimately 20... roughly a couple seconds to 27 minutes until 3 p.m. Then I gotta make way for the E-Zone. This is the final show of the year, guys. So, you know, we're kicking out with some gospel. I want to say Merry Christmas when it comes and a Happy New Year. And of course, in every week, every time, you know what I mean, every Wednesday, once I'm here, you definitely know I'm going to drop some gospel songs for y'all. 2.30 after the break p.m Yes, cuz in everything we do we have to big up God God come first Whatever I believe it or not a god of the man you understand so we have to big him up every time Can I left him out? I forgot this one break
