physical rebuilding of parts of our country will take time, so will the emotional healing of our people. Be kind to yourself and others. Be gentle and stay safe. Together, we will get through this. A and Hurricane Melissa has tested us once again, but the strength of our people is unbreakable. Now it's time to rebuild together. The Government of Jamaica has launched SupportJamaica.gov.jm, the official national platform to coordinate relief, mobilize support, and assist families affected by Hurricane Melissa. Visit SupportJamaica.gov.jm and encourage your friends and relatives to do so.
