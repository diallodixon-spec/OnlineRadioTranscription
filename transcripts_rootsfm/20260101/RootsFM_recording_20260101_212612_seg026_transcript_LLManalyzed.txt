We're in a zone now, don't stop You can't keep your hands on me Just sit right there, run through my legs I can't keep my hands off you Your body is a party I'm the one that's gonna dance for you You got me so excited Now it's just me and you Your body's a party Let's get started, oh Boy, you should know Your love is always on my mind I'm not gonna fight it I want it all the time
