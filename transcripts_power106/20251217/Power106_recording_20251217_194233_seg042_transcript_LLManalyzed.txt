20251217 194233 The biggest challenges, definitely like I said, is going there and having to be fast in one hour before you go into qualifying on a new track, basically a new car. And that's what you're kind of dealing with the whole year. So that's not a thing last year I found very challenging, but doing it all of last year, got very in touch with it and this year was a lot easier to do. But that's definitely one of the biggest challenges. And to cope with that is quite difficult. There's some tracks that don't suit you and you still have to base. Some tracks, for example, one of my weaknesses is a high speed corner. So you're not in a circuit car for let's say a month. And then you're back in doing an hour and expected to take a corner at 230 kilometers flat out in 60 air. So you basically, you don't have any time to be slow and to do it and build up and be progressive. You have to go out there and know that if you want to win, you're going to do it from session one. You're going to go flat out in six years at 230 kilometers.
