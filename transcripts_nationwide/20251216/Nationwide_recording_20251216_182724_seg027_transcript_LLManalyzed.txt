20251216 182724 for tuning in. We ask you to weigh in live in the comments section on today's public opinion. Let's talk about JPS and the impending increase in our light bills. Customers of the Jamaica Public Service Company, JPS, i.e. you and me, should brace for a 7% increase in their December bills. That's according to the Office of Utilities Regulation, OUR. Now, the OUR says that the expected increase is based on the use of more expensive fuel during the passage of Hurricane Melissa but get this the 7% is just the beginning yeah as further increases will be phased in over the coming months the OUR told us today probably over a period of six months yeah so the seven percent increase represents an additional six hundred and fifty dollars on a typical nine thousand dollar bill yeah that's according to the OUR so we want to get your reaction to this
