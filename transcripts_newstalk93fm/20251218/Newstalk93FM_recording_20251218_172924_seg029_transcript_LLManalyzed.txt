20251218 172924 I said five in the morning, I wake up to five of my yearnings. Fear in my mind is a warning. Pray to the one you're relying. I've been wandering all day. I tried to be fine be fine but i can't bear the noise in my mind wouldn't leave me i tried to get by but i'm burning i'm behind my mind it runs all these thoughts are troubling fighting to give up i've been fighting to be on my lane my mind running to the other side When it's time to leave my life Then it tries to take me out Tell you what I need, riot I really need I really need time now I really need I need a free mind now I really need, I really need my love
