You do not fail. What is hard for you to do? It doesn't exist, though. It can never, ever exist, though. You do not lie. You do not fail, what is hard for you? To do. To do. It's gonna never, ever exist though. Those that know you will trust in you. Nones and hussies and chariots. By the arm of flesh, no man can prevail. Ask a Brahman, Sarah, a woman with issue of blood. Nothing, nothing hard for you, you, you. Ask Mama Hannah. Ask Mama Hannah, oh, glad my team just taking over the Israelites. Absolutely nothing hard for you. No man, no man, no man.
