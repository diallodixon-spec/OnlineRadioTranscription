We've got to take the break right here and I thank you for joining us today on the Two Live Crew and I hope you guys heard those wonderful nuggets that she gave because trust me sometimes we can take on the holidays and you know sometimes rest is all that we need. Thank you so much Melissa. Thank you and I just want to close off by saying that this Christmas choose peace over pressure. Choose peace? Happy holidays.
