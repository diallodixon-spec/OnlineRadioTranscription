what the government is looking for. Some children will still find their way around the ban but let's see what happens. Mikael says I think the Minister of Finance was out of the waters yesterday because she could have been coached by the PSOJ and Niger. Remember Metri told you that the PSOJ has been meeting with the government ministers on a daily basis since the hurricane. Hence, she was unable to think on her feet. However, the bigger issue is that we as a people are accepting this sad state of affairs in the country. On the matter of the Australian and banning children on social media, I don't agree as it might cause these children to develop devious means to access social media. Well, that's one aspect which I'd suggested.
