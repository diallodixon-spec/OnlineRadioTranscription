20251226 172318 Got to be with my baby Got to be with him Got to be by his side, yeah I'm gonna be with him And my heart will love my mind I'm living my life, baby So I gotta see my baby, it's been too long Since I held him in my arms and I just won't leave at night So he's living here beside me, yeah Here inside me Again, again, again, again I can't believe I've been through so much Since I've had this fire I've been in touch for so long
