20251229 141709 Love is in the air every weekday morning. Join the Sunnyside Up team at 6.45 as they take you down memory lane with a song from way back when, the years to years. Classed from the past, it's brought to you by Tenron Engineering Services Limited. Tenron, the motorman, to make us authorize the deal of awake motors uncontrolled. Turn the beat around, love to give percussions. This is 94.5, my fan, my friend, Alphard. Ron Prince, all right, yeah.
