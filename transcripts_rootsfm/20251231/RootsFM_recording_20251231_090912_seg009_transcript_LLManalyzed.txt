20251231 090912 A reggae rhythm moves so slow Like ocean tides we've come to know Your eyes reflect the midnight glow A gentle light that helps me grow We leave behind what held us down every broken promise now in this moment calm and near we welcome love and face the year. Let the music guide the soul. Let the new year make us whole. Calm hearts at the turn of the year.
