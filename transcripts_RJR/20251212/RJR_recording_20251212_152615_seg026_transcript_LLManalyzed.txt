20251212 152615 Can't let you out of my sight And I wouldn't go back to your life for one more night Girl, it'd be dangerous Girl, you're livin' too dangerous for me It'd be dangerous When I can't sit through the night If I could touch your body Knowin' not everybody Has a body like you But I gotta think twice Before I give my heart away I know all the games they play Because I play them too Oh, but I need some time off From that emotion Time to pick my heart up off the floor And when that love comes down it, I'll be motion But it takes a strongman baby, thought I'm showing you the door But I gotta have faith, faith, faith, I gotta have faith
