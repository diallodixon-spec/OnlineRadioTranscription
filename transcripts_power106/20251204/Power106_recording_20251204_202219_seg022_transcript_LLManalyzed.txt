============================================================

Searching so long, just for you Now that I've found you, please be true No more eyes, no more pain No more sorrows, no more strength But if you should leave me, I would surely go insane. Because if you leave me, I will never love again. Baby, baby, we are together in this world No more heartaches, no more pain, no more sorrow
