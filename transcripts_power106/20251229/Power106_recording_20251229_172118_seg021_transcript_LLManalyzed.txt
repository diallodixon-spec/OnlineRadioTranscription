20251229 172118 Yes, I think we touched on this last time when we were talking about Ford, where Ford had spent a whole bunch of money getting ready to put a couple billion dollars on putting together an EV plant to make batteries for their EVs. The sales had failed and dropped. They've converted that to know they're going turn the factory into a data center, because they're not gonna be making, they don't need as many batteries as that as much. Their EV products have shifted. A lot of companies have dropped their EV-only mandates, et cetera, et cetera. So, yeah, the lack of demand for EV products has significantly curtailed, you know, as well. In the United States and, I guess, Europe, it's severely curtailed the sale of EVs.
