20251217 162017 for some time. And guess who called? And I mean, I don't always agree with what he has to say, but the same is true for Miss Mervis. I haven't heard from her for some time, you know, and I hope she's well. I don't know if you've been in touch with her or anyone from your team. Miss Mervis called us us on Monday, but she fell off the line. I see. I know it's not easy to get through. This is my third attempt. And I thought, my goodness, I'm lucky when the gentleman answered. You know, it's my third attempt. So I won't keep you, but I just want to say thank you. And again, we so very much appreciate Jimmy Cliff's contribution to music in Jamaica, reggae music globally. That's right. And we're saddened by his passing and his legacy will live on.
