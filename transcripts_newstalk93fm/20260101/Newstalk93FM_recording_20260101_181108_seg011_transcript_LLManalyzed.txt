20260101 181108 You're a treasure in my eyes The greatest pleasure in my life Cause when you're living by the knee Honesty, hurry please Home is where the heart should be Pretty feathers in disguise Not together we will rise So don't you ever Let me down again Cause I'm depending on you So you better come through this time Please hear my cry and if I ever Let you down my friend It was a misunderstanding So if I took it for granted Then I promise from today I'll go jump like I never jump Wait like I never went blind Like I never went before Just to show you I saw you I saw you And I need you back in my life You got people by the truck Emotions from the night
