============================================================

That's what I want There are no hard feelings if you only want to act like babies too For a night or two And sometimes in the morning go back to being someone you never knew You never knew Baby don't you worry You ain't gonna hurt me tonight It won't be the worst night If this is how it is for me Then she kissed me again And said you don't want this hurt Boy, it's already broke Told me every time she touched Just goes up in smoke Only stayed a couple nights, then she gon' be gone I said baby you should know that's what I want She said you don't want this heart ma, it can't be fixed And I ain't ready to drown, am I like this?
