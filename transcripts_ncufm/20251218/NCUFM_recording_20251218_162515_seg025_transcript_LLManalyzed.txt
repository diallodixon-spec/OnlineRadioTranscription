20251218 162515 I just want to talk to somebody right now. It'll take it easy Thursday. You don't have to run no more. Come on home. You can come back home. I know they hurt you. They saw you stumble, but didn't help you. And now they left you. They were quick to pray, but slow to to move And now you're empty Too tired to run you walk away
