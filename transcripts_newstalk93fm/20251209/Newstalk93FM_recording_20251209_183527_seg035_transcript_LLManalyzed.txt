Hold on! I wanna pour a drink in me glass, slow down Driver, do you get dyin' with him? All right! Oh, lady, fine and up Right there behind the truck These vibes and gal, non-stop But driver, why you movin' so fast? Slow down Driver, hold on Let me stop right here And one city gal, then whine up Right by the truck I want you to make it start up Fling that thing, then start back it up Well, the driver, I say slow down In this city gal, then put on a showdown. Girl, drop, drop. No, we get back up. Jiggle, jiggle, jiggle and stop in the classroom. Girl, you look so hot, let me see you, ma. I need you. Hold up, no, girl, stop. Fine, when it's fire, kind, it's fire. Do your party groove, do your party groove.
