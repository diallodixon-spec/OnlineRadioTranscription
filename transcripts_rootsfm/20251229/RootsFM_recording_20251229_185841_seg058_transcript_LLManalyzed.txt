20251229 185841 All I can see around us is violence and crime. Full time for us to sexualize, socialize, and realize. So let the sun shine throughout every day. Let the moon shine through the peaceful nights. This is every time rise and heaven's time fall But I don't really believe in the falling things at all Cause life continues as it goes If you really want to know the truth of the truth doesn't mean it's all No no no no no So I say these are some serious times. All I can see around us is just violence and crime. Full time for us to centralise, socialise and realise. So let the sun shine throughout everything.
