20251226 103130 You are my shining star, my guiding light, I look down to see There's not a minute, hour, day or night that I don't love you You're at the top of my list cause I'm always thinking of you I still remember in the days when I was scared to touch you How I spent my day dreaming, planning hard to say I love you You must have known that I feel it's deep enough to swim in you That's when you opened up your heart and you told me you're coming over you A thousand kisses from you is never enough I just don't wanna stop all my love A million days in your lonely mouth
