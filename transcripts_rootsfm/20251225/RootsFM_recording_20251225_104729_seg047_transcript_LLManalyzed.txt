20251225 104729 Over the hill we go Laughing all the way Bells will watch us ring Making spirits bright It is tonight Finishing the slaying song tonight Jingle bells, jingle bells Jingle all the way Oh my God, it is so right On the one with the open sleigh. Whoa, whoa, oh, yeah, yeah. To and fro, baby. Oh, what fun, it's so right. On a one-horse-open sleigh. Now the ground is white. Goin' wild while you're young. Take the girls along. Sing the sleighigh song Just let it pop, just bang 40 as you speak Get you to an open sleigh and crack you take the land Jingle bell, jingle bell All the fun, all the fun
