20251216 203021 We have a story we want you to wear So everybody open your ear We sing because we care It's a real life drama we all share So it's best you beware No things act one out there This is how the story starts She was with one man and he gave his heart She'd pretend to play the part Of a faithful wife till death do part Slept around with many men Unprotected now and then She did not intend For this to be the end Now she's dying for a cure She just can't take it Crying from the core And nothing can change it Dying for a cure
