Destruction, it don't need renovation I got him, don't need invitation He's my salvation So, me don't let me instruction Then me don't need disturbance Hey, lock out the white Satan Because, he's my destruction There's a roof in my house Reserved for Jesus Come on now There's a room In my house reserved for the Lord Oh yeah! He come as he please And I never hear him leave There I am a worship in my presence. I will live up to my name. I will not put demands on me. Satan follows all of them. He is in this room.
