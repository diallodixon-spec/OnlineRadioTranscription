20260102 101607 I know you will take good care of me God of the valley, the mountains and the sea I will not worry You will make a way for me Powerful and mighty You provide all of my needs To the songs that I will believe That you will make a way for me. Anything this answer should prosper. Anywhere you plan, Lord, stand with me.
