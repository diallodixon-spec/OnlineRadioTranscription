So these, I am very worried about the fact that, you know, the things that will get the economy moving. We haven't heard a word about agriculture. We're hearing announcements, nothing very concrete. The farmers will tell you that, you know they're still in limbo, still waiting. So it's, and you know, this housing. So those are two things that could give the economy a massive stimulus now. Focusing on agriculture and housing, those things will give us a massive multiplier effect if we handle them the right way. Because if we are too slow in getting these sectors back, the imports on foreign exchange leakage will increase, putting us under more pressure. So that is why we need to get these sectors up and running as quickly as possible with domestic inputs so that we can save foreign exchange and create jobs for our people. Agriculture implies some tons and 50,000 persons.
