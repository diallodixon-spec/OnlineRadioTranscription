20260102 122612 I'm gonna love you on a test Though I'm weary, I'm still gonna give you love I'm still gonna make you feel That this is more than real Because you're way too beautiful Beautiful to resist You're more than wonderful And everyday it's bliss You're more than wonderful. And every day is missed. You're way too beautiful. How could I refuse your love? Your love. I know that you would wait on me. Left over time, broken traffic lights and need to see my ID When your lips are touching mine, we're in space, we're stopping time Only you can take me to a place that's so divine
