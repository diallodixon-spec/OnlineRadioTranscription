And she done and I get it Said you stand, you wanted my name and you left So I'm guessing that you never meant it Said you trying hard, all cause of lose So strong now I'm standing alone in this kitchen Singing sad songs, but I'm knowing that this shit don't let me down easy if you gonna leave me baby go and leave me all the way don't ask for all your things back cussing out my name yeah just to go and take back what you say burn all the bridges don't ask for forgiveness walk away like i'm someone you hate don't let me down easy if you're gonna leave me baby
