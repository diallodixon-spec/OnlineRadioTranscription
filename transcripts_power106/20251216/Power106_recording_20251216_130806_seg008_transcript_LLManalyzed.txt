Small businesses are suffering. Everybody is suffering. Some places impact more than some places. We are facing a problem, mash up, mash up. And we don't hear them call out. And our MP and our council are supposed to look after and it cost me money. Where must I get the money to do all of them things here? I take a chance and I call today and I lose about five minutes on the phone. I have to hang up and come back. Bless up. Part of life though, that's what radio is. Yeah, so the producer is money.
