And if I recall correctly, they saw their father's executor's name on the tax roll. And they were thinking, oh my goodness, the executor is trying to steal the property. Why does his name appear on the tax roll, on the property tax payment advice? And that there's nothing untoward, that is perfectly normal. Because once probate is granted, once executor's name goes on the title, they are essentially, quote unquote, what we call the de facto owners. They are the agent of the estate. So there's nothing wrong with their name being on the title. And it's not on the title as owner. You'll see it's what we call registered on transmission. So their name is on the title in a representative capacity name on title as the executor. Again, the numbers to call it live on air. It's 76.
