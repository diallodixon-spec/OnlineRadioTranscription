According to the judge, in electoral matters, time is of the essence. Therefore, not only must this court be satisfied that the threshold test for leave has been surmounted, but there must also be an overlay of electoral realities as a matter of law. She concluded that the threshold test has not been surmounted. The statutory period for the constituted authority to apply to the election court to void the taking of a poll is 14 days from the date the poll was taken. Buchanan has alleged numerous irregularities with the poll in St. Andrew West Central on September 3. Among other things, he pointed to the concerns about the electronic voter identification system and the process to identify voters. But the constituted authority dismissed his complaints. Justice Wint Blair contended that in application, the court was being asked to make orders compelling the authority to apply to have the election result voided.
