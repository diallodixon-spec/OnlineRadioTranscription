20251212 214523 When the whip kills suddenly, he mocks at the despair of the innocent. The earth is given into the hand of the wicked. He covers the face of its judge. If it is not he, then who is it? And my days are swifter than a runner. They flee away. They do not see good. They go by like papyrus skiffs, like an eagle swoops down on its prey. Though I say I will forget my complaint, I will change my expression and I will rejoice. I will become afraid of all my sufferings. I know that you do not consider me innocent. If I shall be declared guilty, why then should I labor in vain? If I wash myself with soap and I cleanse my hands with lye, then you plunge me into the slime pit and my clothes abhor me. For he is not a mortal like me that I can answer him, that we can come to trial together. There is no arbiter between us that he might lay his hand on both of us.
