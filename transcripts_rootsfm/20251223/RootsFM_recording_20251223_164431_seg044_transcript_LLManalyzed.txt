20251223 164431 I think I'm going to you so early in the morning. This nine to five I have is surely getting too mean. And for the third time this week, I think I'm going to have to call in sick. If I leave you now, I'll be losing my mind, mind, mind. I hope we never get tired. And I never have to go to work. No one knows.
