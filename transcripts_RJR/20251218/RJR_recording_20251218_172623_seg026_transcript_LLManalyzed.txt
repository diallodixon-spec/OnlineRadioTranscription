20251218 172623 And by now, of course, clean up is well underway. People are also looking not just towards rebuilding, redevelopment. People are really rethinking what this town needs to them and what they want it to look like going forward. And it's kind of surreal as we're sitting here in the car park of the Municipal Corporation, because to our left we have the sea and a gorgeous sunset so tranquil when you look that way and then when you look over to our right now you'll see what remains of the Municipal Buildings. You'll see the damage that's been done to the courthouse, you're seeing the damage to the various buildings, you are seeing the rubble, piles of rubble all around as I said even though you can see the cleanup going on. So we very much are going to be talking about moving forward and what people want from the town. Happy to have with us in this segment of the program, Superintendent Kimar Brooks, who is in charge of the St. Elizabeth Division of the Fire Brigade. Superintendent, really appreciated
