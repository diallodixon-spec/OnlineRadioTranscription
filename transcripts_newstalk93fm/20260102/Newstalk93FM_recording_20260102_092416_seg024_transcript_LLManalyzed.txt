20260102 092416 I'd rather lie than to lose you girl I'd rather lie then confuse you girl Truth is we laugh and they want us gone Truth is they can't handle me at the top I'd rather spare you the details my love Oh I'd rather, I'd rather lie than lose you I'd ratherab, I took a penny so offer Opposites always a try, how you happy then get mad But I want you bad, if she wanna make up I'ma just tell you that this too long, getting my kidney Wrist rolled over, you mind I'm spinning, I'm off to the same damn time
