20251216 142720 There was something inside of you Something I thought that I would never find Angel of mine I looked at you, looking at me Now I know why they say the best things are free Gonna love you boy, you are so bright Angel of night How you changed my world you'll never know I'm different now, you help me grow Give it to my life, say you'll save my mother If I lift a hook, you show me love I'm shaking for you, for you, ride or die
