Human Rights Group Jamaicans for Justice have called for the decriminalization of consensual sexual activity between minors, arguing that such cases are overwhelming Jamaica's child diversion program. According to data in a recent JFJ report, sexual offenses, including persons under 16, accounted for more than 60 percent of the 1,500 children referred to the program between March 2020 and June of 2024.
