20251215 151007 on Christmas Day, we're also going to be celebrating what we call Boxing Day, New one seven two eight three. Love radio on a Monday afternoon. The innards of the vibes. Wicked and wild, well versatile. I'm on the job. Hey, it's a life to friends not come often, but the chosen few me have to call them. We're real bread of them, real bread of them. Been through the ups and downs. Real bread of them, Real bread of them. No matter what they stuck around. Good friend better than pocket money.
