20251219 104831 I was surprised by my chronic illness diagnosis. I thought working out hard I would fix it, but it wasn't enough. Now, my prescription meds are part of my routine. When I got my diagnosis, I really felt down and stopped spending time with the people I love. Then I decided not to let any disease get the best of me. And I'm committed to taking my meds as prescribed. On time, every time. No hesitation. Take your medication.
