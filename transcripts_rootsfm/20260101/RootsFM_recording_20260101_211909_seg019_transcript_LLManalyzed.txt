20260101 211909 How you gonna upgrade me? It's higher than number one. You know I used to beat that block, but I'm the life to keep the streets on. I noticed you the type that like to keep them on the leash, though. I'm known to walk alone, but I'm alone for a reason. Sending me a drink ain't appeasing, believe me. Come harder. This won't be easy. Don't doubt yourself. Trust me, you need me. This ain't a shoulder, we the chip or our ego. What you think they all mad at me for? You need a real woman in your life. Taking care of home and still fly. And I'mma help you build up your account. Believe me, take it in the big meat, it's like a meal. Take me just to compliment the deal. And anything, cop up the deal.
