The aim is to create a society in which each Jamaican can fully develop their skills and abilities and use them in productive and creative ways to build our lives and develop our country. To access the full National Development Plan, visit vision2030.gov.jm. You may also contact the Planning Institute of Jamaica at 876-960-9339. That's it for today's program.
