20251225 194522 Glory, glory! Christmas time again! Hey, Sun City 104.9, you know, Sun Jack Friar in the building? Approximately 15 minutes rocking up to 8pm. And it's Christmas day. We say Merry Merry Christmas to each and every one. It's Sun City already with a difference, right? Taking you all the way up until midnight, you know, the Star Trek boss is in the building. So you know the stars are out. What a way! I see the greetings of each and every one. All the worldwide lockers right about North Sun City. Feel free to vibe on the World Wide Web, SunCityReady.fm.
