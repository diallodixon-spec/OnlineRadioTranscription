We went through this before, acting like the elves can't bag them no more Nightgown dragon on the heated marble floor Flash Cartier when you open up the door, slide these on baby Soap butters still relate to the gutter, just your lifestyle's different Spirit uplifted, fell in love with a cat who's gifted Journey back to paradise, damn I missed it Pop a bottle light a purple candle, I got something that you can't quite handle That's why you love me Pour bubbly, glow from the flame Make your skin shine lovely I'm saying baby, touch it why don't ya? Touch it why don't you? Touch it, why don't you, touch it, Why don't you? Hey girl, oh girl Hey girl, I wanna rock your world
