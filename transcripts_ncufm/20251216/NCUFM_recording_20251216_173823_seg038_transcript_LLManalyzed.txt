20251216 173823 Blessings. Yes, drive time family. So that's exactly how we can maintain our hope throughout this festive season. So that's the encouragement this afternoon. All righty. So our next feature coming up is the 6 p.m. of sportscast. But until then fret not fret not fret not to have some nice music to keep us going until we get ready to pull up a handbrake at 6.30 yeah man so I'm inviting her to the stage my uncle uncle Donnie McClurkin is gonna be singing something that we're all definitely familiar with. Yes, I'll be right back. Blessings to you. Did I say Donnie McClurkin? I meant the Toronto Mass Choir.
