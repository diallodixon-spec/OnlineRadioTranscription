============================================================

Bless our land, just continue to guide our nation. Oh, Jamaica get hit by a category five. Disaster passed to one, a shuffle life. But we don't still survive. Oh, yeah, oh, yeah. Dead bodies not do what. We see them float. Most people lose it all, but we not lose hope. We're small and not certain, this is where they need support. But we ain't not go up. Children need help me, we don't deserve this. We look to paradise, but we don't go to certain. God knows it hurt me, we do not deserve this. Traumatize on me, I don't need therapy. That's every time I hear me people crying. Hear me people crying. Nothing just fool me. Oh, bless them bodies.
