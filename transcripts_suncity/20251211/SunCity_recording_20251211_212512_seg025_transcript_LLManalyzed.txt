2025-12-12 15:10:44 Even though I try to play it off I'm thinking about you all day long And I can't wait for shorty to come through From your lips and makeup to your eyes My hands on your hips and me crying I'm fantasizing about what I'm gonna do to you Got me feigning for her love, can't lie May you should see how she got me Spending all this time with her And I could leave her if I wanted to Her love turning into a talking to me. I suffocate when you're away from me. So much love you take from me. I'm going out of my mind. I can't breathe when you talk to me. I can't breath when you touch me. Something's keeping you away from me. So much love you
