You know, Drive Time Family, true happiness is not found in what we eat or drink But it's in the love the laughter and the time that we share with our family today has been a focus on family whether The ones that we choose or the ones that we're born into That that that's what matters so this holiday season I encourage you to spend time with some family yes man
