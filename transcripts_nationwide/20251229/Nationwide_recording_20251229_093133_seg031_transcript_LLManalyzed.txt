20251229 093133 Good morning, good morning, good morning. We're back here inside the Consumer Hour on Nationwide 90 FM. I'm Nouragay Banton. We are joined inside Immigration Mondays by US Immigration Attorney Opa Lee and Canadian Immigration Consultant Nadine Mahbair. We are taking your question, Paul. Yeah, I want just a quick one. I just want to clarify something I heard. Old Paul said earlier, as a visitor to the United States with a regular visiting visa, am I allowed to drive with my regular Jamaican driver's license?
