20251223 173519 Christmas it's the best time of the year I don't know if there'll be snow but have a cup of cheer Have a holly jolly Christmas and when you walk down the street Say hello to friends you know and everyone you meet Oh the mistletoe is hung where you can see Somebody waits for you, kiss her once for me Have a holly, jolly Christmas And in case you didn't hear Oh, by golly, have a holly jolly Christmas this year.
