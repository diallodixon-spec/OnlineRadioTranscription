20260102 112320 I think it was eight. Then it was near nineteen and now it's forty-two. Correct. Yes. And you know, at the risk of sounding political, I also want to raise the point that this is only the second time ever that we've seen three consecutive years where we've had a decline in murder. The last time, I think, after 2009-10, there was another three-year decline in murder. And, you know, it's commendable that the security forces and the government have been able to achieve this. But we must also ensure, as you actually said, that we do not divorce the work of the security forces from the policy and the investment that the administration has made in national security. At great expense, I believe the Prime Minister and the Minister of National Security were both taken to task.
