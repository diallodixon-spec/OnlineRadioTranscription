So beyond the fact that this is a retail chain and it is a promotional campaign that seeks to promote our businesses and promote our clients, we're also talking about the economic impact of that as an industry. And we want to make sure that we are touching all the marks. We want to entreat our consumers to look at the tags, look at the labels, and look for that Made in Jamaica mark. And the easiest way to do that is once you step into a Think Jamaican outlet, you are automatically interacting with Jamaican-made products only. And so that's the key message. Home of authentic brands is our tagline, and we want Jamaicans to come home to Jamaican brands. Very good. Thank you so much. And so, that's where you come in now, Ms. Corrine.
