20251217 172623 final of the Issa da Costa Cup football competition at Chabaena Park on Wednesday, booking their place in the final. Dintil struck first when Omeni Morrison found the back of the net in the 47th minute, giving his team the early advantage. However, Glenmore refused to buckle under the pressure and gradually worked their way back into the contest. Their persistence paid off in the 63rd minute when Owen Watson calmly converted from the penalty spot to bring his team level. As the match appeared destined for extra time, Watson emerged as the hero once again. Two minutes into and I just think it's really hats off to them, they dug deep and they performed the way they did.
