20251231 103126 way back you know if that didn't happen but yes provide for your pension you know your pension even with a scheme that may not even be sufficient because people are living longer and so we have to make other provision if we can so we need other investments correct you know and invest something I tell you now, we don't have any space in our lives to waste money. True. Because there's so much we have to do. So we have to have other investments to support even a pension. Because it's not gonna be enough. Correct. It is not going to be enough. And if you're out there and you have not yet signed up with something like the NIS, then it's time to go. NIS is not a tax people. NIS is a social benefit. It is not a tax. Thank you so much. All the best for the New Year.
