============================================================

I suggest if the linesmen are already here, the 170 and they're staying here that the 150 has already been handed over to JPS. None of that has been made clear and all I want to see is the trail. That's all. I'm not suggesting the money gone somewhere else or whatever other conspiracy theories that might have bound. But if you don't question these things bit by bit, element by element, utterance by utterance from individual ministers, then you don't get the information you need. And this business of, you're not supposed to question this, is rubbish. Because we're not lackeys. And we're not just here to be preached to by ministers or MPs or whatnot. We have genuine questions that just require an answer, not confusion.
