20251219 142113 Yo, you're listening to roots FM 96.1. He who seeks of only vanity and no love for humanity shall fade away. Fade away. He who checks for only wealth and not for his physical health shall fade away, fade away. Though some believe in diamonds and pearls And feel like they're on top of the world They shall fade away Hear what I say The rich is getting richer every day
