20260101 164826 One thing I remember what my daddy say A single moment to you is all I need to get by. Say what, lady? Oh, yeah. Sing it to me. If you mean to tell me, it puts you down for another. Sorry, baby. I'm so sorry, baby. Sorry if I'm going to be told in the street again. Say what? Lady, you're singing to me. Did you mean to tell me you put you down for another?
