Did the owner come and collect it? No owner has yet for the tape measure that fell off. That means the Bible says what lasts too long serves too much. No, the finder really wants to give it back. And this other finder in this instance as well really wants to give back what I would call maybe a bracelet or back in the day that was a chaparita but it's a gold one something that's obviously is very precious to somebody and you lost it somewhere in the constant spring area. Mrs. G the finder is not really a picker of pocketers because I don't understand how them does a fine thing so. This is not how the person came back. Did they find it in the possession of somebody else unaware to them? If you lost a very thick gold, a real gold. Mrs G that can melt down and make money.
