============================================================

And that time will Things may not go as you planned Dark clouds might bring you pain But I will be in your heart still Telling you don't look down Don't feast your eyes on things that are on the ground And if it gets hard to focus when you're traveling almost at this speed of sound Remember what I told you and don't you dare look down Don't look down
