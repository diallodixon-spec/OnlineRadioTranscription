20251222 191514 If you recall, I think it was the... I think it was JSAFE who warned the Uber drivers and them to be careful of people asking you to come pick up money from one location and dropping it somewhere else. That was recently in the news. That's that money mule approach where they get you to transfer the illicit funds instead of doing it themselves. So you want to be careful of people asking you as a seasonal job you see or an easy commission. They say kind of 50,000 ago or so and then give you a five or a six thousand dollars. No. The police warned us recently not to do that because you may be transferring illicit funds and you're becoming a money mule. If someone asks you to receive money into your account and send it on, it's a major warning sign. So let me account now, let me try to get us something here and then send you whatever it is and then give you a commission. Don't do it.
