20251216 173323 I'll survive the years so long. If I'm not there, it won't get done. I choose to blame your moment. Child, why you always come running on me? It's my life. Won't you let an innocent woman be Never hurt or self-care Half your brain just ain't fair Let you out, out, out While you always come running Taking all my lovin' from me I like my boys playin' hard to get And i like my men all incompetent and i swear they choose me i'm not choosing them amen
