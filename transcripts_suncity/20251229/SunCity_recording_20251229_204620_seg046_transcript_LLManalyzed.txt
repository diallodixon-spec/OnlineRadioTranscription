When me step in a di club, selector throw down. Gala climb pon box and gala crawl pon ground. Gala lock up in a cage up and pull a sing-round. Me see a three-colour here, I thought it was a clown. When the gals start whine, the whole place a tear down. Gala truck and go down, a bump a touch ground. In the Yancey wine and a move it around. Every man head a spin like a memory go round. Come me tell me selector fi turn up di sound. A mus and compound, a know if rastabound. Let's go! Why you not my body? Me? I'm not my body. Me? I'm waiting on my body. Why not my body me? I'm waiting up my body. I'm waiting up a body me. I'm waiting out my body.
