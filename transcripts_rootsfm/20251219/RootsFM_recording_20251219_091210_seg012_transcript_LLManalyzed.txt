20251219 091210 The same power of the cock of the grave Lies on the inside of me I'm still here, I'm still here Cause the blood still has it's Said it soothes all my doubts and calms my fears Grace that dries up every one of my tears The same power that raised Jesus from the grave Said it lives on the inside of me I'm still here, I'm still here
