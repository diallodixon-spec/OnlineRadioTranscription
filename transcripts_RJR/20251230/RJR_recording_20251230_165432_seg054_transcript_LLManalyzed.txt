And, you know, I don't have a problem when they taught him because to me it does warrant a debate, you know. So I have no problems with the church getting help. Because the truth is the church has been assisting people generally for centuries. Yes, even outside of a disaster, you know, the church is always there. The church is always there, you know. You can go there to pray. Yes. That is still help, you know. But I do think, I do think one should question any money, all the money is going out to different areas. We must always question it, how much going there, because sometimes it might not be enough. You know, like when I hear the 75 million towards the churches in the West, that's been questioned by Mr. Warmington.
