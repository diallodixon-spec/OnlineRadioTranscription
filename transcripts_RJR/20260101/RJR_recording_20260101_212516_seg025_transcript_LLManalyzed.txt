20260101 212516 I'm so sick of love songs. So tired of tears. So done with wishing you were still here. Said I'm full sick of love songs, so sad and slow. So why can't I turn off the music? That takes that calendar I had. That's not July 15th That's the reason I'm so sick of love songs So tired of tears, so done with me shit You are still here, said I'm so sick Of love songs, so sad and slow
