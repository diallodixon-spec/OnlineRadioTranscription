20251224 150302 That's important something sweet The night we go in and have some fun I will know how the people feed it Dancing until the morning comes Hot and groovy Look what so god put to me I feel like a movie. When you throw it back on me, I feel no stress again. Let me dance the night out for you, Benjamin. Feel the rhythm, it's in the go. Take two, fall in love, baby. Darling, let me party. Look you back and all, all, all on one. Welcome to job town, baby. I'm Benjamin. Come, come, come, come. It's me and you.
