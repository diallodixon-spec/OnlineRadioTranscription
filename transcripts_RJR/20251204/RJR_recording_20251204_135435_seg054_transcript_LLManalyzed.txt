I want to say happy birthday to Janine Bethune of the Red Hills Baptist Church. Tell her to just continue to serve the Lord. It's coming from brother Andre, her parents, Deacon Chambers and all the members of the Cypress Hall Red Hills circuit of Baptist churches. A special shout out to Rudolph and Angela Brown of Mandeville. Today they're celebrating their 49th wedding anniversary. How spectacular! With all our love from your children, their spouses and your grandchildren, Merrick, Marcy, Anna Kay, Hugh, Ramonia, Adrian, Hayden, Hugh Michael, Hannah and Rory.
