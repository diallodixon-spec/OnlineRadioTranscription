============================================================

to be honest, I've been volunteering from I was a teenager. I went to San Diego High. And you know, we're used to this world volunteerism. And we used to go to CHAMS, we used to volunteer as teenagers, but there was no entity that you could go to and say, you know, where do I volunteer next? You know, how do I get to volunteer in, you know, we see a lot of Congresses, we see a lot of international events keeping in Jamaica, and they're always asking, you know, we need volunteer. But some people would never get selected because they don't know the avenues to go. We are going to be the one-stop shop, right? So when persons need volunteer, whether locally, regionally, internationally, we are the place to go and we are under the JOA umbrella and therefore you know that we mean business and we are ready and raring to go. What are you hearing from Western Jamaica?
