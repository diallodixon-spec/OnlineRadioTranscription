You can't conceal it Know how I know Cause I can feel it You're a fake, baby I blow a new cover The jig is up Cause I discovered you're a fake Baby No need to hide it Can't change my mind Cause I decided you're a fake baby And I'm disgusted The game is through Oh Whenever I go out with you I feel that if I love you, you'll find out something new You're a fake You always have a good excuse You always have all the good excuses But girl, that ain't no use You're a fake, baby
