**Mental Preparation for the New Year: An Exclusive Interview with Mrs. Sonia Winter**

As the year draws to a close, many of us are reflecting on our accomplishments and setbacks, and looking forward to the new year with a mix of excitement and trepidation. To help us navigate this transition, Dr. Jackie Campbell, host of "Powering Your Health" on Power 106 FM, sat down with Mrs. Sonia Winter, Associate Clinical Psychologist and founder of Tea House Therapy, to discuss the importance of mental preparation for the new year.

According to Mrs. Winter, taking an inventory of the past year is a crucial step in preparing for the new one. "Take an inventory of the year past and use it to article what brought me genuine joy in the year past and what took it away," she advised. This involves reflecting on experiences, relationships, and events that served us well, and those that did not. By doing so, we can identify patterns and areas for improvement, and make informed decisions about how to spend our time and energy in the upcoming year.

One of the key challenges many of us face is people-pleasing, which can lead to burnout and resentment. Mrs. Winter attributed this to an "overdeveloped sense of obligation" and a fear of rejection. To overcome this, she suggested examining our motivations for saying yes or no to requests, and practicing assertive responses that prioritize our own needs and boundaries. "There are wonderful ways to say no that are comfortable," she noted, citing examples such as "I do want to help you, but I have other commitments that I need to prioritize."

Fear is another major obstacle to mental preparation, particularly when it comes to pursuing our goals and aspirations. However, Mrs. Winter encouraged listeners to reframe their relationship with fear, seeing it as a compass that points to potential risks and opportunities for growth. "Fear tells me that I am encountering risk, and that's why I fear," she explained. "But instead of letting fear hold me back, I can use it to inform my decisions and take calculated risks."

As the conversation drew to a close, Dr. Campbell and Mrs. Winter reflected on the importance of gratitude and self-reflection in mental preparation. "What am I most proud of and grateful for over the past year?" is a question that can help us cultivate a sense of agency and competence, and build resilience for the challenges ahead. By acknowledging our accomplishments and expressing gratitude for our experiences, we can instill hope and motivation to continue striving for our goals.

In a final philosophical note, Mrs. Winter reminded listeners that "the only constant in life is change." While we can prepare for the new year to some extent, we must also be willing to step into the unknown and adapt to the twists and turns that life will inevitably bring. As we embark on this journey, we can draw on the wisdom and insights shared by Mrs. Winter, and prioritize our mental health and well-being above all else.
