20251226 103431 Yes, we're having a good time Just take a shot one time Come and enjoy the life When last you've been to a party Plenty women looking so nice We must be in paradise When last you had a time to remember His olive and butter fender And the drinks got gone big up the bartender Who come with the money, come with the honey Who come to dance and ding-o-lay Pie come with a cooler, milk a bit loud Yeah, we come to vibes and elevate No, it's not a mistake When the girls see we did this, we'll participate J bring down the soaker, bust up the speaker Cause it take the stress away On the left, on the right is so much pretty girl Fitting in the carnival With a bag of green on me Like a criminal But if I wine on a girl See the team all the wrong way And we're having a good time Yes, we're having good time Do you remember the time I talked about the very first line? When love
