20260102 202724 Speaking, the students claim that this is the hardest part of a syllabus. As I was saying before, it can be challenging because they find it abstract when they're doing the algorithm. So the algorithm are basically instructions that we must be able to understand before developing the code. So step-by-step instruction, procedural instructions before developing the code in Pascal, Java, or Python. So they do find it difficult, but how we overcome those challenges, as I said before, we normally have workshops where we invite persons to come in and basically teach the girls. What I like to do is my very safe third program class, I show them a code. So a code, whether in Pascal, in Python, show them what they're working towards so that they're not demotivated. Eventually they'll get there and I keep calling them programmers so that they're convinced in their heads.
