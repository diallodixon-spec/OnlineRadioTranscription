============================================================

like I said, was concerned that we had to take with has rallied on an excelen we see together here and we have some work to do, but it. A number of records the three days with Julien speeders being impressiv freestyle. Today I broke the 50 meter freestyle record for 15 and over boys, 15, 16 to be specific and it was a really great experience you know coming to this meet that was one of my main goals and especially seeing that the previous record holder was such a Caribbean legend Jordan Crooks from the Cayman Islands it really meant a lot for me to break that record today. Daniela Powell from Weiss Peters was also responsible for a number of records on the female side. Well these three days they've been excellent for me because I've done really well at this meet and I'm really happy with my records because I know I worked really hard.
