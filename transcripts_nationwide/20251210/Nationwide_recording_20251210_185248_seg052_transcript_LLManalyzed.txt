swayed by the flexibility and say the disaster relief grant is still the one for me. What are the eligibility requirements? How do we qualify for the grants? Well, you know, the beauty about it, Ricardo, first is that you don't have to choose one or the other. If you require both based off need, you can actually get both. But two, to access the grant, we're looking, of course, at proof of damage. We're looking at estimates as to how much it will cost to make the repairs, whether that's from a labor standpoint or from a building material standpoint, because for some people, the damage may be significantly more than what $500,000 can do. But the $500,000, can buy some amount of material. So we're looking for those estimates as well. We're also looking for proof of ownership of course we have to ensure that the people who are accessing the grants as good stewards of public funds have to ensure that they are true not necessarily owners but have interest in the property so we're not the general document
