How are you? I'm good, thank you. Welcome. All right. Let me have a condolence to you and the rest of RGR staff and the passing of Mr. Smith. Yes, yes. I'll tell you something, you know, Mr. Mulling. You know, sir, yesterday when I was hearing the news, I thought it was Mr. Gary Allen. How could you form that view, though? They said he gave his name. I know Mr Gary Hallin, you know, but I think I believe it is Mr Gary Hallin's position he occupied when Mr Gary Hallin was leaving.
