20251231 132816 We're just friends. They say I'm secretly loving you. Oh, no. They say we could have never lived so. I love you, man. Well, every time when I talk to a woman out here, everybody claims every day we die. And if I open a door or pull out a chair, everybody claims every time we die. I've got me cousin and me auntie come take me from here. Everybody claims everydevidant Same old time, the comments them so unfair Everybody claim semidevidant Me overstand it, chatty chatty a bit Will never see relationship platonic Never go beyond it, always be on it Waiting for the first opportunity to grab it Them love to say it, me no okay it Them empty research be research and them still don't obey it. Over the years I've had it, blabbermouth cram it. More time them let's call the Empress Bonnie. They can't see we're just friends. They say I'm burning my lady.
