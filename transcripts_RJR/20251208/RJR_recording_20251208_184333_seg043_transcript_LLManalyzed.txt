I do intend to share that information with him because, again, it's not only for us, it's for nation-building. Has there been any kind of assessment of the value or the extent of the damage in monetary terms? Well, Deanne, I'm not kidding you. We're looking at over $2 million worth of damage so far, right, and the assessment hasn't been done. And that's looking at the household repairs and houses that are to be rebuilt, infrastructure to be repaired, and also, you know, other concerns as it relates to the welfare and agriculture needs of the community. So a significant amount, we're about 2.2 million in our assessment so far in terms of the total damage across only a compound. The decision to turn down the military aspect of the health, from what you're saying, that was a community or council decision, not a core decision.
