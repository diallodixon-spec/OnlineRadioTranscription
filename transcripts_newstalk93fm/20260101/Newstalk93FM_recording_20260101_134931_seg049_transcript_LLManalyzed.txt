20260101 134931 Here we are back again. Fighting once in front of me. There's so much to unpack again. But if I come to Italy, we could be nice to each other. Nice to each other. Wrong for each other. Right for each other. Thank you so much for joining us on this drive. We hope you enjoyed it. And I'll probably crash a stupid car And make your life a misery But we could be nice to each other, nice to each other Walk for each other, ride for each other And rise to each other, rise to each other
