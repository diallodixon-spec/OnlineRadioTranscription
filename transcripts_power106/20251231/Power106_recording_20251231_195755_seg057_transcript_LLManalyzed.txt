20251231 195755 Just a day, just a day. Just a day. The sun will come out tomorrow. Make you want to know about tomorrow. There'll be sun. Think come by tomorrow Clears away the cobwebs And I'll solve it all Till there's none When I'm stuck with the day That's gray and lonely, I just take out my chin and breathe and say, oh, and say, the sun will come out.
