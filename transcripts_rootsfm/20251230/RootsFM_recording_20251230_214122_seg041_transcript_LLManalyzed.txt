20251230 214122 The music in my soul, the music keep it rocking It's not an easy road but we throw it down Like a rebel soldier It's not easy when the system never gave you it We're just a piece of land, the first thing them not gave you it We've got to see to love and build up a rebel tree We're liars, liars, not different, we never gave you the youth We have to guide them We have to be decent, we be strong We struggle and I come from early morning We have to guide them. We have to teach them to be strong. I just want to see my people free From Sweden to Jamaica in perfect harmony
