20251231 154326 Baby girl, I was tired So I lay down to dream for a little while your smile. But I'm not complaining. Cause that's how it goes. There's always some heartache. And that's what I'm supposed to do? But you can't imagine that nobody knows. Nobody knows, baby, that the love stays on my mind.
