We are Congo and New Caledonia all waiting in that mini tournament in Mexico. Only two spots will be available, so two will advance from there and the draw will take place tomorrow morning at 7 a.m. Now to help us unpack all of this or to break it down, the motion, the performer, we're going to make it worse from here. We are joined by former Ready Boy for Sleep, Lin-Val Rudy Dixon. Rudy, good evening, welcome to Power Play once again. Good evening, good evening Sir Williams, and good evening to your listeners as usual. It's a pleasure to be on your program. If you cannot hear, I remember about your different performances. It sounded like a very good commutator because you played so well with those tiny taps.
