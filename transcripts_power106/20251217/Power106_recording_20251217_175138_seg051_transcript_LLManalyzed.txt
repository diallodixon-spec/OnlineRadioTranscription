20251217 175138 It's funny that I haven't got to call you before And why is it I haven't seen you around anymore? Another year has passed that I can't erase The memory of your smiling face So I had to call you up and say Gee whiz, it's Christmas So don't forget the party that we're throwing The warm fire from the fireplace will be glowing. It's been a long, long time.
