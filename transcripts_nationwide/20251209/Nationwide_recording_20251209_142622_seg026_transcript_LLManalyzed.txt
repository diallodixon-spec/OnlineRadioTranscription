I done gave my all to you, fell in the deep end You done came into my life while I was sinking I been on that type of time with demons All the time I was outside, I was creepin' It was love at first, that girl when you walked in Couldn't look deep in your eyes cause I get locked in You was hurtin' deep inside and you was broken But I was on the other side and didn't notice, oh I won't waste no time I won't waste my time when it comes to you For my pot of socks, give it all to you For my Pot of Socks, give it all too I think I know
