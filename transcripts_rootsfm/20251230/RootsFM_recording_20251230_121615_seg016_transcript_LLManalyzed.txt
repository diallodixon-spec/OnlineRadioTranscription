20251230 121615 God has kept us. What a God we are. I close with Psalm 9 verse 1. I will praise you, O Lord, with my whole heart. I will tell of your marvelous works. As we come to the close of another year, let us go and tell of the goodness of God. Forever he has been faithful. I wish you all the best as we look to the Lord as he will take us over. And in everything that we do, let us give God thanks for his goodness, his mercy, and his love towards us. God bless you. To you I say the peace of God be with you. Shalom. Shalom. God bless you in Jesus name.
