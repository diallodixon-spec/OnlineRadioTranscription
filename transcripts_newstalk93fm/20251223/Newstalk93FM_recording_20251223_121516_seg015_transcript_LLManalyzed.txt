Hey, I say compromise on me. Hey, can we talk some business you know i want your company and it's nothing too risky limited liability don't worry if you try all the things i like you could still be shy in the morning So don't feel away You don't like the fast life But look on the bright side girl I go take the blame I just want you come and rise it up Just a little right now
