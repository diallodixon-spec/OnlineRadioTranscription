Money I'm gonna make this year. I'm gonna win this year, I feel it. And if you're not see progress, don't come around here. I'm so focused this year, I'm gonna get my face here. I just progress, progress, progress. We end us down here. I don't want to die. Life is so unkind and full of surprises. Give it your all and you'll get nothing in return. But you got to look to the east from where the sun rises Hold your head up, you got to get up Hold on to faith, you soon got the breath Money I'm gonna make this year I'm gonna win this year, I feel it
