20251224 155229 I won't ask for much this Christmas I won't even wish for snow I'm just gonna keep on waiting Underneath the mistletoe I will make a list and send it To the North Pole for Saint Nick I won't even stay awake To hear magic rain display. Cause I just want you here tonight, holding my heart to me so tight. What more can I do? Oh, baby, all I want for Christmas is you. You, baby. all the lights are shining so brightly everywhere. And I saw the children's laughter fills the air. And everyone is singing.
