20251231 152613 I'll be quite sure when I did my best I could maybe impress you With tender words and an arm A clever rhyme or two What if all I have done in the times we've shared Is to turn your eyes on me? Then I failed in what I've been called to do Is someone else I want you to see? Will you love Jesus more? When we go our separate ways When this moment is memory?
