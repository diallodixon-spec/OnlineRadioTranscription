20251226 161112 I know you think I'm mad You picked your perfect jewel I made us break apart When everything was cool I needed to explore And open up the door But now I don't need you more I'm sending out a message A message so sincere When I close my eyes I need to feel you near Can't get you off my mind Believe in me this time I'm still in love with you Cause my broken heart, boy Cause my broken heart for you I'm gonna stay this time Cause my broken heart boy
