20251223 112618 What else is important for you to visit the farmers in person at this time? Well, I think as I, you know, Clark said earlier, you know, we came there not only to actually help the farmers in our supply chain, we also came there for Jamaica, you know, so it was larger what we do. I said, you know, in prior interviews, our diaspora is what we live, breathe here. And they have been actually so good to us and actually has contributed over the years to golden cross existence. My role larger was one to ensure that within our supply chain, we can actually keep the momentum going, we can actually build back, and we can also, you know, keep that authenticity in terms of our flavor profile. And as I said, Jamaica has been one of the backbone as it relates to ensuring that people plants touch pepper, touch wine and pepper, all over maybe the Caribbean and some part of South America.
