20251229 140603 I'm going to put some of this in and cook it. It's going to be a vegetable with the steam with all the torture. I love my family, so I'm going to plant some cassava. Papa doesn't want me to tell you why I'm going to order. He's going to get jam from my great-grandfather. When it comes them. Grab the bill and come. Now, grab the fork and come. Ready, ready, ready, if you go blow up Jandem. Grab the fog and come, oh, oh, oh. Oh, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh, la, la, la. Well, that's a monkey, a wild shoe. I don't want them spoiled. You see the pot of wine?
