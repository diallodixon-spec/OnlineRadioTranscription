20251223 165448 Listen to me man! We were on a break and something happened. And I chatted something to you. I chatted a bag of soap man and I was like... I was like every minute I'm like, is this on or is this off? Yeah man, we were mixed up on a lot of things man. Remember you received that lady and she was like, she changed her clothes. Oh yeah. And literally never knew what sort of life was on. Oh my god, oh my god. Crazy. Okay, okay, this one is for you Maya. You've been called, ride or die, no I'm not going to defend you. No, anything that has to do with embarrassment towards me. Like cheating, any scandal, disappear. That's fair enough. And then last one for you TJ, what is your partner's most annoying habit? Getting ready. Everybody knows that. Forever. Like three hours or more. Like if you're doing a full face.
