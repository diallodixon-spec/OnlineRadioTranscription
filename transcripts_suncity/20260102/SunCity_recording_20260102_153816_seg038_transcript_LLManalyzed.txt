20260102 153816 Turn up the music, let me rockin' all the time. A lot of different stuff we pop and grab. I be couple up, get mine to go, mine to mine. Give me your music, let me skank and whine. Turn up the music let me rockin all the time. The party weekend. The prelude to the party weekend. It's on a Friday. We're ready for the road. On a Friday.
