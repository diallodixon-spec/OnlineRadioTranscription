But there are persons who even after doing the x-ray, the x-ray come back normal and we still say, hmm, I think you may really have arthritis, but something else is maybe in the early stages. We can send you for a deeper test to find out what's going on. But your best bet to to to detect it in the early stages, obviously, right? Definitely.

Because if you detect arthritis early, in many cases, you can actually control it in terms of both the pain and the limitations to your typical movement.
