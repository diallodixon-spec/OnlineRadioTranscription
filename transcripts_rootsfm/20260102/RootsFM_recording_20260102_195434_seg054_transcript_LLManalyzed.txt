20260102 195434 I want to love this moment of summer sunshine. Oh baby, you're everything gone for me. I want to love the sudden freeing. Hey Julie, I understand you, just understand me now. Giving fifty-fifty love and that I'm good at all the prayers. A hundred percent I love it, could it be my heart desire you're missing. Girl, you're missing. Everyone, you're going out shooting, shooting. Everyone you're going out is prying to you, prying to you. Talk about dick, jocking away. The fifty-fifty loving that you're giving into the pliers. 100% of loving couldn't be my heart desire. You're missing. Don't you know, my baby, you're dissing. Oh, yeah. A hundred percent of loving could not be my heart desire, oh, baby.
