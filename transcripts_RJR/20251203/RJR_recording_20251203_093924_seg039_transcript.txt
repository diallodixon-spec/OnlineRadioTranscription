health, clean water, et cetera, et cetera. So we want you to know that if you're in a neighborhood where there's still standing water one month later, move to a safer space. If you have newborns or young children, because you have to protect your family first thing, right? If you are in a home that has been damaged, just walk around empty those containers with water to reduce the breeding of mosquitoes so the children and your family members don't get ill from some of those vector borne diseases. And if you're in a community where you know there are elderly people, disabled people and so on, new mothers, just get out there and see if you can get them registered for some assistance, get the vulnerable under the Ministry of Labour and Social Security. Have the teams who are out there.
