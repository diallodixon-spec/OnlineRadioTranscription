20251223 195156 I'm changing But you are still the same You're there by my side Before the morn of day goes to day Lord, I just want to walk worthy I wanna walk worthy It's my calling to forgive Remember my steps, Lord And I'll do my best to live The world is never changing The world is never changing. The world is ever changing. A new one in the land. Peace on earth, peace in your heart.
