20260102 184232 Now I'm gonna put the blame on the person that told me They should realize that it's gonna destroy my position Remember I'm a name brand Though I really wanna hear a little news now and then This is not what I expect to hear from my friend I'm disappointed But now I've got to, I should have held it tight every once in a while. Take you to dinner on the fence of style. Show her a life that's all worthwhile. Now I know I got to walk an extra mile. I could beat myself. Oh, yeah, now, now. I could beat myself. Oh, lord, oh, I could beat myself, oh. I could beat my self, boy, now, now, oh.
