20251226 134223 Hey, this time I'll be sweet And our love runs deep Feeling lonely, now you're gone and left me I just can't get over you not being my lover I shouldn't have listened to what my friends say They made me leave you behind Now I'm the one who feels the pain Starting to blow my mind You tempted me with fancy girls And made me feel as if I ruled the world But right now I'm sober, I can't help it if I feel alone You're gonna love me, you can't get over You're not being my lover, so wild, so young
