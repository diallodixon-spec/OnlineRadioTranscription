**Jamaica Sees Significant Decline in Murders, But Experts Warn of Long-Term Challenges**

In a remarkable turn of events, Jamaica has recorded a 41% reduction in murders in 2025, with the total number of homicides falling below 700 for the first time since 1994. This significant decline has been hailed as a major success by the Minister of National Security and Peace, Dr. Horace Chang, who attributes the progress to a series of strategies, including technology and merit-based promotions, as well as flagship initiatives such as Project ROCK and the deployment of modern surveillance, communications, and intelligence systems.

However, experts warn that despite this progress, there is still a long way to go in addressing the root causes of crime and violence in Jamaica. Professor Anthony Clayton, a specialist in sustainable development, notes that while the trend is "remarkable," Jamaica still ranks among the top 10 countries in the world for homicide rates. "We've moved from the top half of the top 10 to the bottom half, but we're still in the top 10," he says.

Clayton and Wayne Chen, President of the Jamaica Employers Federation, were interviewed on Nationwide Radio, where they discussed the implications of the decline in murders and the challenges that lie ahead. Chen emphasizes the need to address the social factors that contribute to crime and violence, including youth unemployment, domestic violence, and social violence. "We're going to have to start looking at the young people who are outside the labor force," he says. "We're going to have to start having to look at domestic violence and social violence."

Clayton agrees, noting that the police can only do so much to address the symptoms of crime, and that a more comprehensive approach is needed to tackle the root causes. "We have to invest in human capital, whether it's socialization, education, bringing people up to values, attitudes, norms that are cognizant of the modern, peaceful society," he says.

However, both experts caution that this will require a massive effort and a long-term commitment to reform. Chen notes that some programs, such as land tenure and formalization of titles, may seem counterintuitive but could have a positive impact on reducing violence. "Giving people tenure in these communities and them being able to own and pass on titles, being able to collateralize titles and so on, gives a whole different flavor to these communities," he says.

Clayton also emphasizes the need for better governance and a more effective justice system. "If we don't improve the justice system, so that people who commit crimes have a certain chance, a fair chance of ending up in prison, we'll continue to be like a dog chasing its tail," he says.

In a surprising twist, the conversation also turned to the issue of police fatal shootings, which have increased to 311 in 2025. Clayton notes that this may be a temporary phase, as the police are going after high-value targets who are more likely to be violent. "If we're going after people who are previously protected, then it's likely that these confrontations are going to end violently," he says.

Overall, while the decline in murders is a significant achievement, experts warn that Jamaica still faces major challenges in addressing the root causes of crime and violence. As Clayton notes, "This is a program which is not going to be implementable within a single generation. We have a cycle, and we are firmly locked into a cycle where you have children who have been neglected, abused, exposed to violence, sexually molested, and then they grow up and they become parents themselves."
