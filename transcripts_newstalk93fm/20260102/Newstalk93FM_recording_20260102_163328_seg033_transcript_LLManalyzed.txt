I want that peace of mind Where they come with that word Baby, now on my wrist, where they run So make you look, always die Oh, no, no pressure Make you give me that love If you give me me, I'm not gonna go. Give me, make a girl my sample. Feelings got me hitting on the freaky dance floor. Make you give me the love, if you not disappointed, me I got you from the end.
