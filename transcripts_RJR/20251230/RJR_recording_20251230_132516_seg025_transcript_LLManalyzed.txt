20251230 132516 25 minutes after one o'clock the voice of Jabouks I've been asking Delhi what happened recently with Jabouks inside a very famous nightclub in Jamaica called Mecca apparently he wanted to perform Delhi yeah he had the mic I saw who him the mic? Was it Taki Taki? MC Nuffy. From my vantage point, it looked like MC Nuffy. And then all of a sudden, somebody said Jabox would take it himself? No, what I realized at the time, whenux were performing, everyone was never ready to leave. So Jabux wanted to call Angola, but they were never ready to call Angola because they were never ready for leave.
