Anoint them, Almighty God. Oh Jesus, I pray, Lord God, that they may touch brother Dwight, oh God. Lord God, consecrate him, oh God, touch his family. Oh God, I pray, oh God, that they touch Tommy, oh God, cover her and her family. Oh God touch even our secretary here, Lord Jesus, at the radio station to cover her on their their wings and their blood. Oh Jesus touch them over the street, O God. I pray, O God, cleanse the creed of God. Anoint me with smiles on their blood. O God, our world institution, cover them on their wings, on their blood. The security God, O God, anoint them, O God, grant them fevers, lift, and strength. In the mighty name of Jesus.
