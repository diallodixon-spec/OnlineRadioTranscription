You need to talk to the town clerk, Robert Hill. The town clerk, not to the mayor. The mayor is a political office. What you really need is a town clerk who runs these matters. Robert Hill. Call down there and ask for the town clerk, Robert Hill. He's the man you need to talk with. All right, not the mayor mayor. Okay. Thank you. Alright. Good. That's it. We're gonna leave it for the morning session. We're gonna make way now for the world at noon. We'll be back at twelve thirty. My hands were steady. My eyes were clear and bright.
