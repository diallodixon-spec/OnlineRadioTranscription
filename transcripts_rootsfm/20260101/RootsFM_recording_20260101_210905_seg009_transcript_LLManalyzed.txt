20260101 210905 Tell me how should I feel when I know what I know? And my female intuition tellin' me you a ghost People told me about the things I couldn't see through the smoke When I need that glitter, they say she's what you need, you gon' choke Who can't stay, you gotta go There ain't no other chick spinning your dough This is taking a toll, the way the story unfolds Not the picture, perfect movie, everyone with a song She gon' be my bitch until it cold, I let you go Mix in the house of the cold I let you go She gon' play everything I own I let you go, I can't let you go Never gonna let you go, she gon' rock the PDF zone I let you go in the back of the road I let you go she gon' party everything I told I let you go I can't let go, never gonna let you go
