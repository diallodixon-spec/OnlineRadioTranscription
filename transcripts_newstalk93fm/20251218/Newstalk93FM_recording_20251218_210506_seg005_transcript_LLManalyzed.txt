20251218 210506 If this world was mine, I'd take it dreams and make them multiply If this world was my not taking enemies in front of God, introduce them to that light. Hit them strictly with that fire. It's a bop. Do your dance, let them watch. She a fan, he a flop. They just wanna kumbayana. This world concrete, flowers grow. Hard eggs, she only doing what she know. Weakens, scared of popping on the low. Better days coming for sure. This world, world. If it was love to me, I wouldn't give it nobody. No sympathy, I'd take away.
