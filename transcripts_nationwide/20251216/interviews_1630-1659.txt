**Exclusive Interview: Giselle Sets the Record Straight**

In a candid and revealing interview on Nationwide 90 FM, Giselle addressed the recent controversy surrounding her and provided her side of the story. When asked why she felt it was important to comment, Giselle stated, "I think it was actually important, so people know that not everything they see on the internet is true." She also expressed her intention to take legal action, saying, "Definitely, but you guys will see."

Giselle clarified that she had re-edited a video to protect the brands of individuals mentioned, and apologized to those who had subscribed to her Instagram expecting an expose. She assured them that "good things are coming" and that she would be posting content on her subscription-based platform.

The interview took a surprising turn when Giselle revealed that she had been lied to, with someone claiming to have "receipts" but instead spreading falsehoods. She emphasized the importance of verifying information, saying, "If you're talking, make sure you can back it up with facts."

Giselle's interview was a testament to her commitment to setting the record straight and protecting her brand. As she said, "I'm done, I said what I said, and I'm done." The conversation was a reminder that in today's digital age, it's essential to be mindful of the information we consume and to verify facts before jumping to conclusions.

The interview also highlighted the importance of protecting one's peace and setting clear boundaries, a theme that was echoed in the show's final segment. As the host noted, "Protecting your peace is an essential act of self-preservation, not selfishness." Giselle's interview served as a powerful reminder of the need to prioritize one's own well-being and to take a stand against misinformation.
