20260101 095424 I never felt like this is strangers With the kid LMA boot up And all you gotta do is call and watch that rape pull up Under the stars since they throwing all the shade on us, facts, woo You're full of vibes, it's contagious Look in your eyes, it's dangerous Grateful I had all the patience I know you're going through some changes You taking pictures, know your angles Ooh, know we ain't perfect but we close. Oh, you give me something I can pay for. That's what it's like loving.
