20251230 193019 Hey, hey, hey You don't like the fast life But look on the bright side, girl I go take the blame I just want you to come and rise it up Just a little reminder now Come and meet me at the end of the truck and we rev it up Say hold it, keep throwin' it back I know why you stopped us Baby, no way We could post up all the pictures you want, when you're ready. I could overshare, darling. Who could overshare? What we could eat in the middle and start a bacchanal. Play in the middle, hey. What we could do now? Jam to a rhythm, yeah. Heat a carnival, baby. Hey, what we could do now, start a wine on it. I say compromise on it. Baby, spend time on it. I said compromise on it.
