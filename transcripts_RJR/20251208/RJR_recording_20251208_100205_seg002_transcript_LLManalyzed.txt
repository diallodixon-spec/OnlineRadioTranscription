Elizabeth Robinson of Sandy Springs, Oklahoma, was arrested on December 2 after a security officer found a loaded.380 pistol in her purse as she attempted to board the Liberty of the Seas at the Nassau cruise port. She later pleaded guilty when she appeared before Magistrate Lennox Colby Sr. Her attorney, Bejean Ferguson, said the firearm was a gift from her aunt and had been in her possession for over 50 years. He also told the court that Robinson lives in an open-carry state and had forgotten the weapon was in her bag due to the early stages of dementia. The Cayman Islands is set to upgrade its air traffic management with a U.S. $11.7 million modern air traffic control system, including a new control center. The Cayman Islands Airport Authority says the project will significantly enhance flight safety, efficiency and coordination.
