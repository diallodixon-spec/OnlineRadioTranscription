20251230 143829 I was in a tunnel and couldn't see the light. And whenever I'd look up, I couldn't see the sky. Sometimes when I'm standing It seems like I've been walking miles And my heart could be crying It's in the middle of a smile But then I climbed the hills and saw the mountains I hollered help cause I was lost Then I felt a strong wind. Then a small voice saying the storm is over. Storm is over now. I can see the sunshine. Somewhere beyond the clouds. I feel heaven. Heaven is for me.
