2025-12-12 13:13:44 Hey, hey, so why should I be afraid of you? When you bleed just like I do. The more you try to fight, judge a light you're shining through. So I've got no time for you. Because in my view, you want to step in on my shoe. You wish you never live alone, feel so damn confused. How every day you wake, you ache because you know you're fake. And every step you take, I bring you closer to your grave. But your teeth and tongue gonna let you down Reward for your words shall be profound
