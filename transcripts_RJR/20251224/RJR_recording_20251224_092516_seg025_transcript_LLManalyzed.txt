20251224 092516 I just want to bring it. I tried calling them to let them know that persons are aware and there are two living complexes nearby. And the scraps, some remains are left there and there's a stench because you know when heat hits meat, you know, and fire, it leaves that there. So it now brings now health concerns with other businesses that are close by and the living complex that are there. So I don't know if anyone listening, you know, because I even thought about calling the NSWMA, but I'm not getting anybody online. But there must be some other way to properly dispose of the garbage. So I don't know if they can speak to the operators of the restaurant. I don't know is it that they have rented it or the other ones who are operating the restaurant. But this can't be the thing. Totally honest.
