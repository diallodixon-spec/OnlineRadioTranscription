20251212 213925 I love it when the bassline is vibrate. Y'all in my bubble and gyrate. Me up and up and up and elevate. A big vibe where you activate. I feel like dance all changed nowadays. I feel like enough y'all now wind up them waves. I feel like some of them didn't even know what they have in Jamaica. How the culture represent the whole place. I feel like. Some of the skankas dem fi load the video like. I feel like every y'all fi grab a man and bust a wine. I feel like Babylon. Nuff fi lock up the dance party fi go on till broad daylight. I feel like every girl to grab a man and bust a wine me feel like Babylon nothing like half the dance part if it go until broad daylight me feel like get a youth nothing done tough every youth feel have a fat ride we look the road Life of the party
