I think you, when you matter the program, if you put the program on a balance, and somebody say something wrong, if we correct them. What was said wrong to you? Because the drink commander say, um, everybody on the team be good. And everybody, you know, you know them, you know, so because we check it out. So what I did, all right. check it out so all right one it's his opinion two i actually said that i i don't agree that there are not other well-thinking articulate speakers on the jlp yes i i said that you know i said that to him and then when i say listen it sounded initially as as if he's saying that there are no talkers on the PNP as well. And then he corrected himself, but I'm saying there are politicians on both sides that can speak well and articulate themselves very well. Yes sir.
