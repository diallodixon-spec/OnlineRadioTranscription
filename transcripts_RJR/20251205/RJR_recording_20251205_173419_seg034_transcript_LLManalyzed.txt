All right, thank you so much for staying with us. We continue with you on Beyond the Headlines. I'm Dionne Jaxmillo. So remember my question for you today. What do you think people should do in terms of Christmas festivities? Should people say, all right, cancel Christmas, let's all stay home and spend our money, you know, helping to buy zinc and helping to rehabilitate? Or should people go ahead with the usual entertainment events. Leroy in Tampa says people should still go out and party so the economy can get back on track. I agree with Ramesh and I also have DSA in Canada saying I think to stimulate the economy get things back to normal from that perspective the parties can go on especially proceeds are going towards recovery. You have to watch that sometimes you see some something and people tell you proceeds towards charity or recovery and when you check it out it's point zero one of one percent or some something like that. So always read between the lines and ask questions and do assume says any significant amount
