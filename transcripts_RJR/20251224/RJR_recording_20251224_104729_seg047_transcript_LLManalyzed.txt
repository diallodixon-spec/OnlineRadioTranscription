20251224 104729 and someone died, and I think after that, the set just disappeared. But believe it or not, the quality of music that was coming from it at the time, you know, while King Toby was there, I'm saying image was that kind of uptown, poor people, disco, it's a strange thing. And it was bugger case. And when you hear bugger case over the mic, you know, speaking, you'd say like, Mormon is in the morning here, or in the evening here, or something like that, you know, Baga Case playing. So big up Baga Case, make the Christmas catch me in a good mood. A beautiful local Christmas song. Of course, nothing to me like my Christmas tree. But those Christmas songs, enough love. And I hope that bugger you're doing very well okay big up my name or a bill to all right let me go to the phone lines again good day how are you good morning hello good morning
