Everybody wanna feel I breathe Forget your troubles and the're off with me You no feel like making music cheap Who knows, who knows, who knows I just go with the trade wind blows Sending love to my friends and foes And I suppose I'm pleased To be chilling in the West Indies To provide all my wants and needs I got the sunshine, rivers and trees Released When me see Jah, me see your way Just take a list straight from me procrecy assay Every man to them own a philosophy
