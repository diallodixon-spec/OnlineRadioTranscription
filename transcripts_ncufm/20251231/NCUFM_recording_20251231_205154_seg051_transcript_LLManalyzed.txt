20251231 205154 Thy foot to be moved. The Lord which keepeth thee, he will not slumber nor sleep. O the Lord is thy keeper, the Lord is thy shape. Upon thy right hand. Upon thy right hand. No, the sun shall not smite thee by day, nor the moon by night. He shall preserve thy soul, even for evermore. Amen.
