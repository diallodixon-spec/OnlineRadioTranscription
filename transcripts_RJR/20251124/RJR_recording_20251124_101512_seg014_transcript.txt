JPS is urging customers not to pay anyone to have their electricity service reconnected. Customers are reminded that unauthorized reconnections can be extremely dangerous and can result in serious injury, electrocution or damage to property. This practice is unethical, illegal and could delay restoration efforts. If anyone claiming to represent JPS requests payment for reconnection services, report it immediately to the nearest police station or JPS. JPS thanks all customers for their patience as teams continue working to restore power safely and as quickly as possible. You're now listening to Dr. Orville Taylor, Talk With Substance, on Hotline. Radio Jamaica, active for the good of our nation.
