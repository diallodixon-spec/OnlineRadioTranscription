20251215 211005 I never get tired And I never have to go to work No one, no, you know, but don't disrespect and don't disturb Sorry, no, baby, I'm dying And my no heart is blowing Just the whisper of our voices all day long A man who don't sweet treat his woman, surely wasting a lot of time. She might not say it, but she needs tenderness in her life now. When I look in your eyes, baby, I see clear as a morning sun. I gotta take some more time off and give you extra fun now that I know you like it.
