20251231 125029 So tonight Close your eyes, there's no more need to fight Watch God provide God provide It's hard to say when there's no food to eat Or what you see feels all that life will be And will this be another year of misery for me? But my faith can't survive on just things I see. And my feelings can't control my destiny. Say, God, I only want what you believe.
