20251224 161609 Cause that's Christmas to me, oh why? Cause that's Christmast to me I listen for the third of rainy, walking on the roof As I fall asleep to lullabies, the morning's coming soon The only gift I'll ever need is the joy of family, oh why? Cause that's Christmas to me I've got this Christmas song in my heart I've got the candles glowing in the dark I'm hanging all the stockings by the Christmas tree. Oh why? Cause that's Christmas to me. Oh why? cause that's Christmast to me.
