And now a little boy's gone Help me Lord, help me And she looks up to the sky And she heard a voice reply When you cry, I cry I cry alone with you When you smile, I smile I smile alone with you when you cry. I cry. I cry alone with you and you smile. I smile, I smile alone. I'm a baby left homeless, abandoned when he's gone.
