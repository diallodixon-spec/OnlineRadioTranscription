20260102 131210 I don't know what tomorrow may bring But I've got a feeling Alright, I am alive There must be a reason I was given one more chance My heart's still beating Getting alive But I'm still breathing I don't know what tomorrow may bring But I've got a feeling Oh, I, now I am alive There must be a reason I was given one more chance, my heart's still beating Now all this time, I've been blind Only running against the wind Friends of mine, last with time After living a life of shame
