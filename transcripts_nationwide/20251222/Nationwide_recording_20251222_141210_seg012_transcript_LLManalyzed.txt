20251222 141210 That's what we're talking about I wanna hear you shout it out That's what we talking about Where love look like you give me And me give you love too Now what do we The kind of love we pursue You see truthfully It must step on the inside For you share it outside Then it's read around wild off the hill You see, it gets better with time You believe in me And that'll make me light shine more easily So now I'm gonna keep trying I know I'll be fine Together we'll find a way To love in a lovey way Love when the change and it stays the same Love is so pure it'll shine a light Love is so sure it'll save my life, yes And love can heal the pain
