20251231 104924 11 o'clock. We have gathering chat. We're going to deal with some more wellness. And of course, we invite Arlene. We'll be back next week. I would have started really ready and fresh again for the new year 2026. Thank you, Dr. Longmore. Wow, doing a great job. Dr. Longmore from Quality Care makes everything seem, all the information seems so easy. You know, sometimes you go to a doctor, you listen to a doctor and you're like, what did he just say? I don't understand a word he just said. You know, the terms that they use, they're over your head and you know, but he is just so personable. So we thanks Dr. Longmore for, you know, in a couple of months that he's been on board with us, Quality Care. We thank you so much. And Adira, thank you so much for sitting in for me on that particular day. It is 10 minutes to the hour of 11 o'clock, and we just steal a whole lot of vibe. New Year's Eve, the love, you know? Yeah, man, the love, the love. It sound like a cliche, but love conquers all.
