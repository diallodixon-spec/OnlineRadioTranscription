20251217 125736 Ruel Johnson. Thank you so much. Until tomorrow when we meet again, it's Request Day. customs duties and taxes are cleared on a customs goods declaration known as an IM4 or IMS4. Ask your clearing agent to provide your customs declaration, customs assessment notice and customs receipt once duties and taxes are paid. Where your clearing agent may not be able to provide the IM-4 or IMS-4, request your customs goods declaration registration number or C number, which can be used to verify your payments. Importers, request your IM-4, IMS-4 or C number. It is your right.
