============================================================

I took a visa To show Avicii I was cool And when I finally got sober Felt ten years older But there was something to do I'm living out in L.A. I drive a sports car just to poo I'm a real big baller Cause I made a million dollars And I spend it on girls' shoes But you don't wanna be high like me Never really know why like me You don't ever wanna step off that roller coaster and be all alone And you don't wanna ride the bus like this Never know who to trust like this You don't wanna be stuck up on that stage and you're stuck up on me
