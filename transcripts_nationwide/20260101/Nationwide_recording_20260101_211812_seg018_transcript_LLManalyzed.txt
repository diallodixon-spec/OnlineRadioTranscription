20260101 211812 I've been through the pain and been dragged through the dirt Whatever they tell you, we're bigger than words I've been where you're standing, I know how it hurts Let this be your song now and this be your day If we stand together then we'll be okay Cause we're survivors, we're making a world Expecting the best when they hope for the worst This is the way we found Even though they let you down Nobody's perfect now Don't let them hold you down Let's stick together now
