20251226 111310 And I know Dirty heart can't wash with soap The meditation is so blinding And they shall slowly fade away Well granny tell me friend, don't trip So from the garden day you sleep Friend, we don't sleep A family with seven cars And everything we put my shorty to your friend First, if you're making money, only enough You ask them where he stack the sheep Back a nickel, more peep Watch him kill the neighbour quint Don't sleep Cause in the yard they sleep, you won't see it Boy, boy, boy, boy When I call your friend, I see you as my brother. Always like that.
