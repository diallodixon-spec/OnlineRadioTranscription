day indeed across the world with the passing of Mr. Chambers aka Jimmy Cliff my father told me a story of him meeting the young musician while working at a record distributor downtown in the early 70s a humble giant of a man he was never the one to beat his chest with all his great achievements he will be sadly missed by lovers of great music that's from Tim in New York State thank you very much for that Tim and you are absolutely right a humble giant of a man I said earlier we would not be able to speak of the numerous accolades and distinctions this man has achieved in his life. We can't cover all the bases, but I said we would do the best we can. Never the one to beat his chest though.
