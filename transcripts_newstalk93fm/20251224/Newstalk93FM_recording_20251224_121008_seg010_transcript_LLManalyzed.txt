20251224 121008 So I don't think no self-particle finding. You can't find me out on the road Not ready to walk Just left work Time to free up Can't ever let me go Go send a search party to find me I out on the road all night Tell them that this hookah hang me If you ever see me Wednesday Go send a search part to find me I lost on the road all right Tell them that the hookah hang me I'm not coming home tonight, not coming home tonight.
