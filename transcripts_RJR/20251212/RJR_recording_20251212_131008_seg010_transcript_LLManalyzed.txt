2025-12-12 14:20:29 I'm holdin' on the front now Scraping is dancing at the end There's a big ship that can't steal it Wait, that twisted woman She knew through the the night, controlling my mind with my soul. I can't believe it, and the feeling is right. We would like to be back, we don't have to wait.
