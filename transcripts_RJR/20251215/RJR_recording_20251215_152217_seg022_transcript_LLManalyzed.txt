20251215 152217 94.5 Give thanks to life. All praises to the Lord, we see a form of sanctified. No need to stress me, me a wall of vines. With bread, boom, tea, chair, and moon in me bone to find. And the Lord is around us, in blessings around us. And the light is around us. In blessings around us.
