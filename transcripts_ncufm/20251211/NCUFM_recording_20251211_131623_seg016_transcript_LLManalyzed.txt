Where you wanna feel it? Well, the enemy came against me. You called me about it. I take my burden and I'm in a stream. For what God a day has arrived, He will maintain. I'm grateful He covered me. Oh, everybody come on and sing it. You covered me You cover me The hand of protection The hand of protection Was called around me If it wasn't for Your grace And Your mercy And Your mercy Thank You, Lord Thank You, Jesus. Here it is. I've been so many times.
