20251216 183625 Alright, thank you so much for staying with us. We continue with you on Beyond the Headlines. I'm Dionne Jansmillo and in this segment of the program, we want to talk about a special concert that's coming up and it's by the church bells ring. People celebrating the birth of the King. Shouting all seven hills, the heavens ring. Christmas is coming, and the church bells sing. Christmas is coming and there is faith we want, bringing us a message of competition. Glory and hallelujah are the wonderful things this verse is coming.
