20251222 185150 I came across an article in The Observer, this matter of productivity, and I found it interesting that a business that was operating for more than 70 years, People's Leather Supplies, the report is that it's set to close, and the reason is not because of falling sales or even adverse market forces, it said, but simply that there was no one to carry on, no one to do the work. and the principals were complaining that when they do hire young people for example they're not applying themselves yeah and so it doesn't work out and i wondered across the manufacturing sector that issue of productivity how is it affecting the sector it does affect the sector and it has been affecting the sector for a number of years. And through the GMEA, we are trying to work assiduously with UTEC, with UE, with CMU, with Heart and SDHR, to try and encourage these programs.
