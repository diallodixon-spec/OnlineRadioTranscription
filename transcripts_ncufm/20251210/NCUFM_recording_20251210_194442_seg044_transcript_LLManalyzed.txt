When we worship, when we worship When we worship, watch the enemy's kingdom go When we worship, and I go crumble all your Jericho on Watch your faith grow strong and die When we worship, When we worship Hear the mountain calling Hear the shackle them pull It's the worship of the rising To the barrier call Oh When we worship Come before you with a dry, full heart When we worship Here in your holy presence, laud you God When we worship It's all about you from the very start When we worship Worship When we worship, worship When we worship So wash the enemy's kingdom floor When we worship Let a gut crumble all your cherry coals When we worship Wash your feet gross
