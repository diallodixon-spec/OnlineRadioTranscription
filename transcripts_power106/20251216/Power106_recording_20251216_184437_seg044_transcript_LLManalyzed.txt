He says that he is not interested in anyone going to the World Cup who wants to be voted the best player in the world. He's interested in people who want to be part of a winning team. And that's because if this system is going to work with four front players, those front players are going to have to sacrifice. They really are. So they can't wait around eating popcorn, waiting for the ball to come to them. They're going to have to work and get behind the ball. And one big question here, and we won't find out the answer until the World Cup kicks off, is can they play this way in conditions of extreme heat? Because so much of the World Cup is going to be played in the conditions of extreme heat? Will it be too much? Will they have to put more men in midfield and cover up a little bit more? Can they play with all this attacking talent up front?
