Here hoping and praying that it ain't too late I thought I had my game tied Thought I had it locked down, no it wasn't right Now you wanna blow, before I let you go So you just gotta know That it's not for me, I'm getting back tight with you Go ahead and dip, you got the right tune if I gotta roll up my sleeves and fight for you It's never gonna end, no I'm out of here Young girl, got that fit a little bit
