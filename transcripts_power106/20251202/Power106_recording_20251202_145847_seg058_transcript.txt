perhaps the head of RADA or designate what they have been doing so that people can understand what is taking place on the ground. I don't want to spend too much time on this because I hear that we spent too much time on both sides talking about food and agriculture. But the fact is that I don't think you can divide, you can divorce what I do on the morning show sometimes from what I'm doing here because people raise the issues and I have to respond. That is the nature of the business that we are engaged in. But I would say to you, it is important for you to register with RADA. If you're a pig farmer, it is important to be a part of the Pig Farmers Association of Jamaica. If you are a small ruminant farmer, goats, you do any small ruminant at all, it's important for you to join up with, team up with Trevor Bernard and his people. Yes, the Small Ruminants Association of Jamaica. So you have to form association so that people can know what is going on. If you're an egg farmer, become a member of the Jamaica Egg Farmers Association.
