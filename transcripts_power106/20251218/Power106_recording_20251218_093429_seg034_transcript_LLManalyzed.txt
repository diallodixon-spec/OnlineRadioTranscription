20251218 093429 Kingston. Mr. Salmon, welcome. Good morning. Thank you very much for having me. Same to you, sir. And yours. All the best. Thank you very. Okay. So, um, Mr. Salmon we saw yesterday, the 35, um, the 5,000 bags of fertilizers we delivered, but you know, does this really make a dent in what is required to revive the coffee industry that's under so much pressure? Well, the first thing I'd like to say thanks to JAKRA and the government for providing assistance. Any assistance is of importance to the farm.
