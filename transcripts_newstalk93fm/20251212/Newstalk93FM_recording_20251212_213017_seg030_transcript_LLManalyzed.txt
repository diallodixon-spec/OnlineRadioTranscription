20251212 213017 I have a lightning spirit Early in the morning I hat it Me cooler ready, me ice done ready Me punching that's automatic Ready, ready, for the rum Ready for the action, a spiritual encounter Killing the soul, taking over Telling me to start up the drinking And do away with good behaviour So we out on the road now, boom It's Mars and Riddim and Sorka And are ready for the rum, ready ready for the rum Ready ready for the rum ready for the action, boom! Wo yo yo yo yo, wo yo yo yo yo yo wo yo yo yo
