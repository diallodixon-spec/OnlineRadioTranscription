============================================================

Everyone was out for us. So we have to be very, very competitive. And they actually saw that. What's going to be happening going forward now? Anything on the calendar? Any events that are coming up next? Next week Wednesday, we're supposed to be in Puerto Rico. For runs three and three basketball, but it's all female. Well, now let me tell you, I've got to be frank. I'm going there with an intention to go on the podium. I don't know how, but my aim is to be on the podium. Nothing less will do. Thank you very much for being here and we know we are going to be hearing from you.
