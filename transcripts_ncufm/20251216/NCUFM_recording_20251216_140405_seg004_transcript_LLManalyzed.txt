20251216 140405 Lewis Hamilton won both previous races at the circuit, with his 2020 victory marking his record-breaking 90-second career win. And finally in basketball, Dallas Mavericks rookie Cooper Flagg made NBA history despite defeat, becoming the youngest player ever to score 40 or more points in a game during a 140-133 overtime loss to Utah Jazz. The 18-year-old No. 1 draft pick finished with 42 points, 7 rebounds, and 6 assists at the Delta Center, joining LeBron James and Kevin Durant as the only teenagers to post a 40-point, 5-rebound, 5-assist sass line in league history. Dallas appeared in control late, leading by 8 points in the final minutes before Utah forced overtime. The Jazz then dominated the extra period behind Keonte George's 37 points and Laurie Markkinen's 33 to secure their 10th win of the season. The Jazz are now 10th in the Western Conference and the Mavericks 12.
