I know of instances where persons were denied job opportunities because of things that would have surfaced that they would have probably done in the past when they were in the YOLO phase of life, which is the You Only Live Once phase of life. But I always challenge young people to say this, that nothing that you do, especially once it's shared in the online space, the digital footprint remains. You're right. It cannot rub off, you know? And so this is one of the things where we encourage our young people that you have to be responsible. I do understand that when you're young, you will make mistakes. And even us as adults, we make mistakes. But I always encourage them, think before you post, right? And I also ask them the question, are you who you post to be?
