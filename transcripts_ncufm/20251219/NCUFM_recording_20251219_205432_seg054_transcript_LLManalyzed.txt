So being good doesn't count at all? When do you know when you've done enough good, Fred? Well, uh... Fred, that's the point. We can't do enough. That's why God offers to forgive us if we'll just admit we need His help. Another message from Lifeline Productions, the comic strip of radio at lifelinepro.com. Who can satisfy my soul like you? Who on earth can comfort me and love me like you do? Who could ever be more faithful?
