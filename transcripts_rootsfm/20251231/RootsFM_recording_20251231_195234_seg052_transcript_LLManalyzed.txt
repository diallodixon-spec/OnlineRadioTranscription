I come from a different zone With many people sheltered at home With them nice computers and phones With them fresh bank account at low Twelve o'clock in the night we a-roam War laws, no money to go home Nobody had mechanical surgery But everybody hips and chrome We stay sharp, we no care what the topic was.
