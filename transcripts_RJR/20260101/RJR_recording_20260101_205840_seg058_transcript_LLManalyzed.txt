20260101 205840 Can you play that song? Set the mood for me To all our different identity I'm loving all the music sounds Give me liquor and drop Make the bass line roll and catch And me love how the rhythm just a-tap Me and my woman a-hack Give me liquor and draw Make the bass line, roll and catch I make we couple up and, couple up and Roll and bite non-stop Me love it, me love it Me love the juggling All in one foot, mother that. So do, no struggling. Now, no need to make up your face. No need mugging. Good vibes in the place. No one watching. Long time, something to feel like. It's semi-like. It's the bean well-cleaned so fresh. Oh, yes.
