Who is it? Who's walking over the star today? We've got the one the only the man of the moment the man of the year the star youtuber Rick Jam NYC I'm telling you he says aiming for six out of six today on a frigid day. You need to get yourself a nice life blanket. Yeah, man Errol Townsend has already won for the year. Yes says hi coming in at second there. Annie Smith says gee Annie has already won this year as well. Rick again say hi. Will you say hi again? Jerome Robinson looks like he's gonna be walking away with the star. I think this is his third or fourth star, but he's actually leading for this one. Nice vibes! Jerome says Yo, what's up? He's on us. It's all good in the neighborhood. My G Nicole says check check. Welcome to the show. Majestic Gaby Fee says easy. I mean, there's a little much to easy. You know what I'm saying? It's just easy.
