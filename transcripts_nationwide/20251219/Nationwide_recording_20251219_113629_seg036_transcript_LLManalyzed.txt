And so today, I call upon a very special core of nation builders, our custodians, our parish justices of the peace associations, along with all well-thinking Jamaicans. I urge you to mobilize, to support families who have lost everything, and to lend hands and hearts where they are needed most. Most importantly, work with government agencies, the churches, civic organizations, and to ensure everyone who needs help get assisted. Jamaica will rebuild and we will do so together. May God bless you all and may God bless Jamaica.
