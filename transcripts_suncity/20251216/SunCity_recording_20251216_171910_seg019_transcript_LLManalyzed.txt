20251216 171910 When I open my eyes, what will I see? I'm looking for one thing, thing, thing. Your number on my phone, make it ring, ring, ring. We broke up in December. Maybe we made a mistake. This holiday used to be a thing. I know that you'll remember. So if you do regret it, this is the perfect chance to get back right. Why don't you call on Christmas? Say you miss us. Are we both alone? Why don't you come on Christmas day? You miss us. Only thing I want. Watching them snowflakes falling, waiting on you to come Watching them snowflakes fallin', waiting on you to Why don't you call on Christmas? Say you miss us, did you find someone?
