20251219 154526 are the major regions, but on top of that, there are other regions within the diaspora council that have representation across other countries. And so I would encourage members of the diaspora that are listening in, that are tuning in, please register to vote. The elections will be in February, and I will officially step down from my role as the global Jamaica Diaspora Council rep and I'll go back into Jamaicans Inspired, which is a diaspora organization and I support Jamaica, but the official role of Global Jamaican Diaspora Council will go over to somebody else when they are elected. But please do register, listeners, please register to vote and the votes will be in February. All right, Nathaniel, thank you so very much. And I have no doubt that you're going to continue to serve in an outstanding manner. And in the event we don't get the opportunity to touch base again for the rest of this Christmas period and heading into the new year, I really want to wish for you, your family,
