20251223 124945 I go to the welding school and I pay for one ticket. And from I get that ticket, it worked out that while I was there in training school for two weeks, the company I'm working for, they have some guys training there. And so the management from them, they came up and they came into my booth and they said, oh, you're a good welder. So he was there talking. He thought I was one of his students, but then the instructor come up, hey we have nothing to ask you. When do you want to start to work? I right now. And then after that I just keep going small courses, build up and then once you have your tickets, you put in your job with a hard work game. Once you have a skill, trust me, you'll never hold up a job.
