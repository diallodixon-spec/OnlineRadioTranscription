and you know when you have an airbnb somebody booking your airbnb internet is a very critical component um that kind of facility is necessary and not having that is a problem flow i tell you flow is it's almost like a monopoly you know almost almost um but they do what they they do and they stay in business so what what am I? What can I say? But I think if we have no other callers for the morning, OK, Mr. Jones slid right in time. Good morning, Mr. Jones. Good morning, from the radio. All right. Yes, I'm having the same issue, you know. I was listening to the radio and you were saying that the flow gives you 24 hours. I do the same thing with the radio because I have been having a problem with the internet connection on my phone, my data. But when I look on her internet connection on her phone, it's saying 40 megabytes per second, 30 megabytes. So when I look on my phone my phone is saying 1 megabyte.
