20260101 130201 I wanna feel your loving I know you can't show me I'm gonna take a little time A little time to look around me I've got nowhere left to hide It looks like love has finally found me In my life There's been heartache and pain I don't know if I can face it again But I can't stop now, I've traveled so far
