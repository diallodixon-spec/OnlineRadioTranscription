20251229 114325 So we want to just give a shout out to all the caregivers out there who are caring for, it could be a mother, father, sister, brother, some family members, to our healthcare workers who are also caring for persons with diabetes. We also have several diabetes educators here in Jamaica, pharmacists alike, and we want to give a shout out to all of those persons this morning. Our guest today is Dr. Andrea Daly, pharmacist and diabetes educator, and she comes to us with a wealth of experience. And we just want to just talk about the pharmacist role right now. Why is it important that patients should speak to their pharmacist about their condition, whether it be diabetes or otherwise, but in terms of the medications that they are taking?
