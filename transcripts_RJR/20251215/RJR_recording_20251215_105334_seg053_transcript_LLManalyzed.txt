What I'm getting from this is that you're saying, listen, in terms of, especially for sicklers, right, I don't know if I'm using the term, it's easier for me to, you know, to convey my thoughts as quickly as I can. That you have the, not only the regime or the process, but you are able to be with that at the various hospitals so you don't run the risk of being further down because there's a competition for attention. You have trauma cases coming in and things like that. And so you'll find that if you don't have a particular protocol that you stick to, that you start with a sickler patient, then you run the risk of being left behind. That's what you're saying. Exactly. And then guess what? Being a sickler, you can die.
