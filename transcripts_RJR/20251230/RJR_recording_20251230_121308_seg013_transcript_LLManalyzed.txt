20251230 121308 Good afternoon and welcome to your lunchtime sports report, I'm Denise Walters. We start things off with some football news. Although playing to a one-all draw, both Racing United and Arnett Gardens believe they should have come away with a win in their Rio-Navy-Jamaica Premier League match at the Anthony Spalding Sports Complex on Monday. Fabian Reid put the junglest in front in minute 67, but Taji Grant pulled the leaders' level in the 74th minute. The result meant Racing moved to 27 points and remained at all the standings, while Arnett Gardens remained just above the relegation in 11th on 13 points. Anthony Patrick is a coach of Racing United. Yeah, it was definitely a good game. End to an action arm. I think the game would go for 90 minutes.
