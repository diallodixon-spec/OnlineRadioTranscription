Every fact I draw, jumping up, doing what I want. Jumping up, tell them I ain't leaving, right there I'm fetter drunk jumping up doing what i want jumping up tell them are you living right there sleeping sometimes i just tell you what pull me self but i can't ease the tension too much affect and boom man they say i'm too out of control but there's too much action somebody pour an exhaust untilon Until my head's gone And I'm miserable All down on the ground I'm causing trouble Look how these security watch me They don't know about me I can smash up the place And I'll be set like a chumby
