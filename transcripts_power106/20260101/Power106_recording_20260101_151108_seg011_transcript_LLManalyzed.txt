20260101 151108 To get into the groove Boy, you've got to prove your love to me Get up on your feet, you're a step to me Boy, walk with me Only when I'm dancing can I feel this free At night I lock the door and no one can see I'm tired of dancing here all by myself Tonight, I wanna dance with someone else Fill out your fantasy here with me Just let the music set you free Touch my body, move in time Now I know you're mine
