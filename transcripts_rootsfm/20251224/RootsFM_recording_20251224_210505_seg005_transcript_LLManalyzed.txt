20251224 210505 You wish you were ever so weak And then it's a war to myself Santa's gonna come and make it mine this Christmas night I bet it's really gonna snow this year So I put through the windows, got the A's reindeer Just safety here Just gonna swoop on my best, swoop on right down my irony I've been really, really, really good this year So put on the red suit and the camera gear Because Christmas is here Just like the scene without my baby. Come on, rock with me, go save me. This is unrealistic, but I believe in you, same here. So grand, just a wish for me, right, babe? I don't want you comin' to make it like this, this one's mine.
