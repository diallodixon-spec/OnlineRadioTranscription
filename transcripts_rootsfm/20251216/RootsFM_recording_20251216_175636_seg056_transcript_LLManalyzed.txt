20251216 175636 A few calls because it's RSVP No thanks, no party lights It's Christmas Eve, gotta relax Turn down all of my invites Last fall I had a night to myself Same guy called Halloween party Waited all night for him to show This time his car wouldn't roll Forget it's cold, it's getting late Try to turn home and celebrate In a quiet way Unwind to doing Christmas right this time Oh damn, guess what I forgot So I'm with the boots back out in the snow To the only all night grocery when What's my wondering eye should appear in the line Is that guy I've been chasing all year And this one alone, he said We didn't break this year's been crazy I said me too, but why are you You mean you forgot cranberries too
