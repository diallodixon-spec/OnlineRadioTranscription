20251217 163622 some we have some cars or some vehicles have like earbags and when a accident or when a vehicle would have ended up in a collision the airbag would technically would have automatically come on to stop you from flying out of the car base or the impact because of how fast the car is moving which would have been the velocity and the weight of the car you would have been pushing you to fly out of the car but the airbag would have basically been the other entity that is acting upon you that would have caused you to come at a stop so you don't fly out of the vehicle okay that makes sense actually it actually really does okay i think i think i have a way better understanding of this whole momentum thing and it's really all thanks to you thank you so much miss jones for coming on the bus being on the drive
