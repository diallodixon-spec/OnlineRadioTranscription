20251230 180301 we have music. Now, a feature on the show over the last few years is that on the first and on the last Tuesday of each month, we go country, country and western, that genre. Never mind what you hear about it's racist and you know, yeah, that happens too, but not really. Country and western, it's really great music. They have fantastic lyrics and love songs and all kinds of things, popery really, of different things you will hear in a country and Western song. One of the greatest recordings in my view of all time, because there was a video in the very early days of video recordings. This one made it and proved to be incredibly popular. And even today, over 40 years later, it's still, about 50 years later, is still around. Glenn Campbell is the artist, obviously no longer with us.
