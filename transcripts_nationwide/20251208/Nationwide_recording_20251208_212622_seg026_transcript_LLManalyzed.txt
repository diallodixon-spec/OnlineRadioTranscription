Darling, for so long You and me been finding each other for so long And the feeling that I feel for you is more than strong, girl Take it from me If you give a little more than you're asking for Your love will turn the key I, I, I just to be your everything Open up the heaven in your heart and let me be The things you are to me And I suffer without a strength If I stay here without you, darling, I will die. I want you laying in the love I've been to break free. I do what I've been free to do.
