20251223 103524 I'm serious. I don't understand how the Ministry of Health allows an institution like this to have a place like this that hosts dozens and scores of people per day. And they know it's not their convenience if I had a bar. I don't know where the bus park is in that area. Oh, no, no, I asked that because I'm not sure if it was like in a plaza where there's a common restroom or so on as against a standalone where there is no access to a restroom. Nothing like that there, Mr. Mullins. Oh, I see. Nothing like that. And I want, we have to engage the minister of Health now, to take a look at what is happening, and I don't understand why, how this place could be granted a slice of home, without any certain inconveniences. Well, I don't know.
