so much hell that the woman who actually placed me came forward. I believe from, you know, Lorna, the woman who was trying to get me out, pushed her. I said, you gotta get her out. She's gonna stay there and die. Because in those days, it's really a place where you just go and there was no plans for you. You would just be there until I guess you grew up and they kick you out. There was no plans. There was no school. There was a little makeshift school that the older kids would try to keep. There was no structure, as I would say. So it's not a place where you go to thrive you're lucky you even survive and you were there because you had no better home situation no better home situation you remember how you felt during that period
