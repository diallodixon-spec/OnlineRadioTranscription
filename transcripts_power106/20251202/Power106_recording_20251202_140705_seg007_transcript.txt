============================================================

Stop worrying, stressing, please just take it slow Release your heart and set your mind at ease There comes a point in your life you gotta let it go You gotta let it go, you gotta let it go Let it go Say why do you wait and worry When you could be spending more time planning Your life is like a car driving in a wall Before you stare it out, you start crying Say why you hold on, it's not yours If it was, then it wouldn't drop bitter tears You're like an emotional rollercoaster You got to face your hurts and fears Let it go
