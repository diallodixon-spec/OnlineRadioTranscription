20251230 173423 Thank you so much for staying with us. So the government has announced that it is allocating $75 million to the Social Development Commission to support churches and faith-based institutions rebuild after Hurricane Melissa. Member of Parliament, government member for Southwestern Catherine Everett Warmington disagrees. We're getting comment on that. We've been hearing from the Bishop Reverend Christine Gooden-Bengushe, outgoing president of the Jamaica Council of Churches, who has been saying Mr. Warmington's assertions that the churches haven't been really active in the relief effort are inaccurate. Let me bring in Bishop Dr. Alvin Bailey, president of the Jamaica Evangelical Alliance, and we also have with us social development specialist Dr. Peter and Baker, who I'll get to in a moment. Bishop Bailey, so should the government be giving the churches money for rebuilding? Why the churches can't rebuild by themselves?
