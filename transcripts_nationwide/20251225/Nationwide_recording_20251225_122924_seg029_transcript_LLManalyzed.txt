20251225 122924 It's another Christmas holiday It's a joyous thing, but it ain't the same Cause we're together, we're not alone Can't let it sleep away No more time, it's rainin' sleep'm by your speed I don't care but the rain Let it snow, yeah Let it snow, let it snow Let it snow Come over right here And help me true a dream
