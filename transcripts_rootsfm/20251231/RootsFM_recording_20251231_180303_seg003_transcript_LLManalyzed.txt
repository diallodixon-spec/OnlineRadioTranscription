20251231 180303 actually came out of, as Dion said earlier, a little crisis I had, and God has been good. So let's look at Exodus. Exodus. Of course, you know what Exodus is all about in scriptures, doubt-filled by memory. Thinking there was no way out of this diabolical trap, having worn a t-shirt, pants, shoes, and even the cap, but the stubborn hand of the sovereign Lord pulled me out with his strong tender cords, painting the door of my heart with his blood, passing me over, saving me from the flood. Leaving the former life, he took all that I had. I exchanged my sorrows, now I'm blessed and glad. My friend, you can make it out of your mess. Trust in the Lord only, you will pass the test. Thank you for that.
