20251212 204232 Maybe I'm a fool to love you But I do Your dreams are what they say There's nothing more than mission Then one day you will be mine My heart will shine I am just a clown When the sun will sleep I'll still be around Knockin' on your door Can I love you anymore? Maybe I'm a fool to think you really care. Maybe I'm fool to think you always will be there. Told you that I love you.
