20260101 155332 One day I was in my room and I wasn't feeling you I said father are you there? I'm feeling real scared So I got down on my knees as I began to pray Hoping that the Lord heard what I had to see So as I begin to cry, I said, I never left your side. I've been right here all along, so you can dry your eyes. You're seeking me like I knew you would, praising me like you know you could. That's when I realized that so.
