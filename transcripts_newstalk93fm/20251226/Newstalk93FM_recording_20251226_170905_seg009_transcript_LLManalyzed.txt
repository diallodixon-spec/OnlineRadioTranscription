20251226 170905 I'm lost in my feelings Somebody send me a sign cause you know that I need it Can't even show me love, wake up and show place that I'd rather be Strong up together Right now is our energy Strong up together Sokka is our partner We're strong up together I tell you so much of my mind That I can't sleep I stress it all the time I can't stop it Cause I'm always on the grind My body's a key
