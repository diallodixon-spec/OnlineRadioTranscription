This was the car my father bought for me on my graduation. Look, here's the keys to my pinto. It's the least I can do. We worked on it all summer long together to restore it to its original condition. I know, and I'm so sorry. Listen, I can make it up to you. I'll paint your house for you. I was going to pass it on to my son for his graduation. You like my wife's chili? Let's say I have her make a big pot, huh? You know, it looks like your trees need some pruning. I can paint your fence. Hun, can you put on a big pot of chili? My car. Better make that two pots. A hundred good deeds can never erase one sin. Only Jesus can remove our sins if we ask him to. Have you asked? Or are you trying to cover your sins with good deeds? Another message from Lifeline Productions, located on the web at
