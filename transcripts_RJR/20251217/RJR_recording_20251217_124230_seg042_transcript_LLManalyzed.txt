20251217 124230 Are there costs to withdraw anything from the account when the partner plan has run its course? Alright, so it is a dedicated account. So that cost really is defined by you. The minimum amount that you can pay per year for a regular iSave account is $5,000 deposit, right? And of course we have several iSave accounts. We have iSave for home for those who aspire to become homeowners and we also have iSave long term which is a more committed plan where you make monthly deposits up until about five years span and of course you will be able to earn interest on that money per annum. And the interest is like what we're talking about now? It ranges from 2% on $1,000, 3% on $5,000 and if you are able to save more than that it goes up to 5%.
