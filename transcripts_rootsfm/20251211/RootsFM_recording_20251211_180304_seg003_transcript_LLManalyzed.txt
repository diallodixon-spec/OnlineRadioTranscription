2025-12-12 03:01:50 You're the light of my life and you mean so much to me. My unforgettable dream. Unforgettable dream. I want to the world. Unforgettable. Rise it, shine it, sun it, shine it. Farm it, grow it, almond, grow it. Hold it, clamp it, shake it, shake it. Almond, quick it, and reshake it. Shake it, drop it, scoop it, pile it. Almond box it, farm it, farm it. Take it, weigh it, sort it, send it, chop it. Dice it, dice and smooth it. Blend it, blend it, then re-blend it. Milk it, milk it, almond, milk it. But I might say that pregnancy stopped me a car for only partings.
