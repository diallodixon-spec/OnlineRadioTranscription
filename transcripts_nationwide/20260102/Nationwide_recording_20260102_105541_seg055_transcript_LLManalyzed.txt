20260102 105541 Give thanks to people like Marlon Morgan, who have to be there. He can't tell you. Because me and him have to catch up. Sometimes as me come off a station, or some radio station, not just here, he's the one next in line to send the message, my friend. And I personally been calling out of people, like the chairman of the party. Well, the general 16-year-old, Dr. Chang, was carrying a very heavy burden with the crime and again to manage the party. But I was calling for those who were in position to come out and say something. The party was left up to the foot soldier. And I'm saying this to you, I don't want to say long. I'm saying this deal. The general election was once totally on the back of the Honourable Prime Minister. Because when I go out in the community, people are saying facts. I handle all this as a man, you know. I handle all of this as a man.
