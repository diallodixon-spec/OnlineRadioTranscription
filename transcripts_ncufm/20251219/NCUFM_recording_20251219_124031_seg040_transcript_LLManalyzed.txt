20251219 124031 experiences, I'm sure you've learned a lot. Do you have any tips you'd like to leave with me so that in your absence, I can properly and safely transport a wonderful cruiser as the remainder of the season? Okay, well, I'd say be yourself. I've always been myself. So be yourself. Don't try to fit into any mold that anybody's trying to usher you into. Be your whole self. You know, don't don't allow yourself to be bullied by anybody, even if it's in love. Yeah. Yeah. So stare with compassion. Keep your compass set on faith and always listen to the crew. Like you said, producer. Okay. All right. A good captain doesn't just command the ship he cares for the passengers as well great great i'm definitely going to employ those wonderful tips you've shared with me now before we end our little chat cruisers i have one request for you i need you to
