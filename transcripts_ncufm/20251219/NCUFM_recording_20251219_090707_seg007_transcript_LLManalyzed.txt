20251219 090707 you're here with me. If you were on the cruise since the beginning of the week, you would have already known that today is my final voyage with you for a little while. truly is going to be a bittersweet day for me but as usual we're gonna have a great time it's gonna be an amazing cruise I can see the Sun peeking out and it's promised that we will have fair season calm weather weather today. Biometric pressure, humidity and temperature are all normal at this time, so please do sit back, relax and enjoy cruising with me and the other godly seafarers on our journey.
