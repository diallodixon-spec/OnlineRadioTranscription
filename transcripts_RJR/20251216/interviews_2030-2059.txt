**Interview with Dr. Neil Gardner on Pyomyositis**

Last night, on the radio program "Back to Health," Dr. Neil Gardner, a renowned medical expert, sat down with the host to discuss pyomyositis, a rare but potentially life-threatening condition. Pyomyositis is a bacterial infection of the muscle that can cause abscesses to form, leading to severe pain, swelling, and even septicemia.

Dr. Gardner emphasized the importance of seeking medical attention immediately if symptoms persist. "Pyomyositis can be fatal if left untreated," he warned. "The infection can worsen and get into the bloodstream, leading to septicemia, which can be life-threatening."

When asked about treatment options, Dr. Gardner recommended antibiotic therapy to reduce the infection, followed by draining the abscess if necessary. However, he also suggested that natural remedies like black salve could be effective in draining abscesses externally. "Black salve is an excellent natural remedy that can be used to drain abscesses," he said. "It's essential to note that it's for external use only, and individuals should consult their physician before trying it."

Dr. Gardner also highlighted the importance of prevention and early intervention. "Chiropractors like myself shine more at prevention than intervention," he said. "It's crucial to address health issues before they become severe."

The conversation also touched on the topic of blood tests and the importance of understanding the results. Dr. Gardner analyzed a blood test result sent in by a listener and provided guidance on how to address mildly elevated numbers through nutritional changes. "I would advise speaking to a naturopathic doctor in Jamaica to get on a nutritional regimen to address these issues," he recommended.

Throughout the interview, Dr. Gardner stressed the importance of consulting a physician before trying any new remedies or treatments. "It's essential to speak to your doctor before trying anything, as it may interfere with medications or delay necessary medical attention," he cautioned.

The interview provided valuable insights into pyomyositis, its treatment options, and the importance of preventive care. Listeners were encouraged to take charge of their health and seek medical attention if they experience any persistent symptoms. As Dr. Gardner emphasized, "It's always better to be safe than sorry when it comes to your health."
