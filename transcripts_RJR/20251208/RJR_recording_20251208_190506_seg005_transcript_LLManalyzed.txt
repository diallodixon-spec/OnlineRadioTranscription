A Friday question for you all this week. Australia is going to be the first country to ban social media use for children under 16. That comes into effect on the 10th of December. They'll require major platforms to deactivate their accounts of children under 16 banned from accessing social media platforms in the 27 member states of the European Union. On the 10th of December 2025, Australia will become the first country to prevent those under 16 from using certain apps, including TikTok, Instagram, Snapchat, X and Facebook. Critics argue the ban could push children to unregister.
