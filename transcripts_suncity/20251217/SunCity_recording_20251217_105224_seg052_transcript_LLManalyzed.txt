20251217 105224 Let's not forget to where we're from father show us the way to go. You said I lost love and feed my enemies, and I am gonna do it. You said I shouldn't take your grudge, and I won't, not even for a minute. Let only truth come from my lips. Bless our souls, Lord, without you we can't make it. Lord, watch over our shoulders tonight, and help us lead our lives tomorrow. Let's not forget where we're from, for the show is the way to go. You're the wind beneath my wings, see me through all the things, you lifted me up.
