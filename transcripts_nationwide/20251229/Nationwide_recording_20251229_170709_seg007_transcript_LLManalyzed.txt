20251229 170709 act with clarity, cohesion and strategic discipline. That's the word from outgoing chairman of CARICOM, Prime Minister Dr. Andrew Holness. Dr. Holness made the call in his end of year message amid heightened tensions within CARICOM over increased US military operations in the region. According to Dr. Holness, CARICOM remains committed to the Caribbean as a zone of peace, but he notes that the Caribbean must now navigate a rapidly shifting geopolitical landscape. This has global tensions intensify and external geopolitical developments increasingly intersect with the Caribbean's interests. Dr. Holness says Karakum must ensure that its responses are guided by shared principles. These include respect for sovereignty, adherence to international law, peaceful engagement, and the resolution of differences through dialogue and mutual respect. Dr. Holness says Karakum's credibility has always rested on its abilities.
