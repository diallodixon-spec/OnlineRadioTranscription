20260102 192822 to say keep me because of these things, but don't believe that him winning 14 more seats for the PNP will cause the opposition to sit and allow him to complete the term. They will believe that he is fair game, he's here for the taking because he did not deliver the ultimate victory, which is control of Jamaica House. Janet, quick comment, you're a little out of time. Well, I would say not automatically as it relates to resigning, but the result demands serious reflection, accountability and renewal. The PNP lost the election and obviously has joined in a Westminster style system. Leadership accountability is always on the table after a defeat. But to me, context really matters. And the fact that the election was extremely close, about 10,000 votes between the two, the PNP gained significantly, moving from a weak position in 2020 to 28 seats. To me... So they're a strong loser.
