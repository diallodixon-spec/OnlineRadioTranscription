Like we started by the joke, by the joke, like we start it by the joke. Party on the road, there's a party on the road. Line it up, line it up, bring the shots and line it up. Party on the roads, there's party on the roads. Look at knives in the back, watch rock and roll in the front. Party on the streets, party on the roads, baby. Come on, baby, up in the air, wave them up in the band. People from everywhere, welcome down to the land of the party. We love to party.
