20251212 210402 I want to be free from all chains and all bundles and ropes Free from all bars and all borders and doves Free to price the land because me no price the boat Some I know you wash your face with a bill and soap Me a bully by fate and you me a bully by oath Life rough and hard but with it me a fico Some take it on the level and some fly down the slope Silent river run deep but Gangali have to float I was born to be free.
