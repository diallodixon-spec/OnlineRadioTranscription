2025-12-11 19:37:00 sit down and depend on the government to put in regulations in place because when my son was much young and so on, certain things, I never allow him to participate in especially on social media. No, no. Yeah. As for me, that time he was doing CXA hunting, his school work is paramount. Yeah. At that time that was very, very important to me. I think also, because I don't want to trivialize it and I understand that in this dispensation parenting is hard. Don't get me wrong. I am seized of that fact. You know, but I think present day parents just have to make a stronger effort at the job rather than just say let me just leave it up to the government. Because I don't want people to think that I think oh parenting is easy and I appreciate that it is incredibly hard. They go to school, they take public transportation, they're exposed to all kinds of things. Yeah?
