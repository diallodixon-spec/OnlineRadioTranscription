20251225 181007 Sun City, right here with a difference. With a difference, with a difference. I wish I could rip out a page Of my memory Cause I put too much energy in me Can't wait till I get through this phase Cause it's killing me To where we can't rewrite our own history Such a mystery When you say we're me It's hard to believe I'm still lonely. Chances fade now, visions run out. This ain't how it's supposed to be. I'm living like magic, sleeping with the enemy. How do we reverse the chemistry? I don't want us
