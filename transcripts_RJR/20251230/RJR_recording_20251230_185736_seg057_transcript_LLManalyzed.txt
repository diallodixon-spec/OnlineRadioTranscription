20251230 185736 where it's shaken. Donald Oliver joined The Observer in August 2025 as their audiovisual manager and immediately made an impact on their digital platform, starting with his production of their 2025 general election night results show, followed by their coverage of the world championships in Tokyo, Japan. His expertise in writing, production and presentation came to the fore in those productions and was even more evident in the news documentaries they aired in the aftermath of Hurricane Melissa. The Observer said they lost a valued and extremely talented member of their team, a man who, beyond his professional skills, was a warm individual and decent human being. They extended their condolences to Donald's family and expressed their gratitude for the opportunity he gave them to know and work with him. And we here at the RJR Greener Communications Group, especially the Sports Department, express our condolences to Donald Oliver's family and friends on his behalf.
