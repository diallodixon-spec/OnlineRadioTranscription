20251212 180202 You must receive God's free gift of salvation by placing your faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. That means you understand that you are a sinner and that the penalty for sin is death. But God sent his son Jesus Christ to pay that penalty for your sin through his death on the cross. He was buried and on the third day he rose from the dead and lives forever to intercede on your behalf so that you too can have eternal life. Your sins will be forgiven and you can have eternal life by placing your faith in Jesus Christ today. This is the only thing that will ever truly satisfy you in life. May I invite you to join us next week.
