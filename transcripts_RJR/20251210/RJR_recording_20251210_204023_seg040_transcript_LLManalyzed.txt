============================================================

If you don't trust people, they'll send you to jail. If they test you, they'll fail. And if they know you don't like me, they won't hear. All those who see my name don't follow me. Because they don't want to know who they've never grown to be. Fake friends Let me know, let me see. Let me know! Let me know! It's my life, and I pay my bill. I never beg or do nothing, so who do you think you're telling? I hear one hate, and I hear one kill. But I trust in the Almighty, so I scale it road clear, so me young do la go press gas No brake light, press a riches on me next stop You have one life, and me make you flap, flap Love me, love me, love me better you stop chat Love me Love me now, love me now Love me now, Love me now
