20251212 173019 It's like I don't have any sense, man. You know, everybody has talked about it in the media. You know, if you stop listening to hearsay, you ever experience that? Customs don't go into your package, suitcase, barrel or cargo unless you ship the item or the agent stand up right there when they inspect it. Listen, customs job is to protect the borders, collect revenue and facilitate trade. They don't collect or store shipment, they inspect it, and somebody off-represent it for inspection. So how do customers ever get so much custom then? Tracy, and the customs alone involve the clearance process, even though it's them we tend to talk about. Look at it this way. Shipment delayed, talk to your airline agent. Missing items? Talk to your freight forwarder. The charges surprise you now. Call customs. But remember to collect your sign and stamp declaration or C number from your agent.
