20260102 135741 Happy Birthday Dad! They say they love you. God bless you always. This is good. I love when the sons big up the dads you know. Yeah man, says a lot, trust me. And this one says Happy New Year to Live Crew. Please send the Happy Birthday greetings to our brother, Kashtan Swamy of Berry Hill, Not Patrick's, Manchester. It's his special day today. Lots of love, big brother. Greetings coming from sisters Suzanne and Rosemary. Here, sending happy birthday anniversary greetings, also blessings to one and only Audrey Ace, otherwise called Latara, praying that this will be your best year ever and that you'll allow the Almighty to order your every step. Embrace this milestone and enjoy the moment, Queen. All right. Happy birthday to Mrs. Clark from 6 West Greater Port War coming from Jackie, and I hope she lives to see many, many more.
