20251229 213728 I can. It may not make it easier, but I have felt you near all the way. Coming out of the dark, I finally see the light now, and it's shining on me. I see the light, I see the light. I see the light coming out of the dark. I know it doesn't save me. I'm sharing it with you. Forever, forever. Stand on the rock of your love. Forever, ever, ever. Can't nobody stop me, watch me. Forever, ever, ever, ever. Keep on fighting, stop and watch me. Ever, ever, stand on the rock. All the love is all it takes.
