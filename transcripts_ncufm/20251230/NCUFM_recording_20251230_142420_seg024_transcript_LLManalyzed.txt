20251230 142420 Interestingly, Maxine, I am not sure if the team deliberately posted it yesterday for that reason, but I saw you made a comment and I stayed away from that comment. But the post said, God's willing, see you tomorrow. But Maxine, listen to what I said in the post. It just flowed well with the post. As a matter of fact, when we were doing that recording from much earlier in December, was it even in December or was it in November, we did that recording. When I ended the post that way, our marketing manager, she laughed because she liked how I tied everything together. So when I said that in that recording, it was never about seeing it tomorrow as in like today go listen about the post Maxim But when I see you write it, I say no I'm not even a reply It's just regular vacation time man
