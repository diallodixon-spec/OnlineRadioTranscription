20251212 130201 Everybody's talking all this stuff about me. Why don't they just let me live? Tell me why. I had a new commission, made my own decision. That's my prerogative. It's the way that I want to live. I can do just what I feel. Nobody can tell me what to do. But what I don't, I'm talking to you now. Don't think you're wrong. I'm really not a fool. Ego tricks is not my place. You know you love too hard. But I tell you it's not nearly hard enough. They say, girlfriend, you know you go too far. Around the world ain't far enough. Cause I only want to show you what you've made to me.
