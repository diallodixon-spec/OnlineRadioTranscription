So researchers at the University of Utah set out to make a bionic hand that could mimic some of those circuits. The result is a system that uses machine learning to help a person carry out a task. And Marshall Trout says it worked in a study of four people who tried to use the bionic hand to drink from a cup. Without the machine assistance, the person just crushed it or dropped it every single time.
