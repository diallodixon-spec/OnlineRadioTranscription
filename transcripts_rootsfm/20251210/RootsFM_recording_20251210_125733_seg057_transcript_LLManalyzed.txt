You would even say it glows All of the awful reindeers Used to laugh and call his name They never let poor Rudolph Join in any reindeer game A Merry Christmas A Merry Christmas To you and you I'm thinking of better days Throwing all my fears away Listening to what my father said Oh dear Lord I pray Yes the road gets rough sometimes We must seek and we will find Yes there'll be some better times But only if we try Little things we do and things we say Can change our lives in many ways Be wise whenever we make a choice Gotta live with them for the rest of our lives I'm thinking of you and me
