20260102 185636 If Leeds were to win the game, I would not be surprised, even though it's my team United. But the Leeds United team seems to be more up for it than Manchester United at the moment. Yes, and Elland Road is a tricky place as well to go. It's hard to play. Yes. OK, Fulham may be at Graham Cottage. And Liverpool, making a forward move, will be the visitors. This Fulham team is showing a lot of resilience. They've picked up some wins where people thought they would not. They were beaten in the last four. Three wins and a draw. And I think that they'll get something off of this Liverpool team that are not scoring goals, that are not doing well. You know, they tried to blame the problems on Mo Salah. Salah is playing in Afghan at the moment and Liverpool continues to struggle. So I can see Fulham getting at minimum a draw out of this game. Yes, we should go watch a bit. All right, Spurs, we'll be at the starting line-up.
