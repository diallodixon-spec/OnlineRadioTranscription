20251231 131816 Holding me closer till our eyes meet You won't ever be alone Wait for me to come home Loving can heal Loving can mend your soul And it's the only thing that I know, know I swear it will get easier Remember that with every piece of you And it is the only thing we take with us when we die We keep this love in this photograph We make these memories for ourselves Where our eyes are never closing
