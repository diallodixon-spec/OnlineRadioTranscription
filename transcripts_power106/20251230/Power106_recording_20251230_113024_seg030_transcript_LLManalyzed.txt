20251230 113024 I've been to 17 countries that we're working in this area and clearly our churches work. What's wrong in giving them the money? The churches don't pay any taxes. The churches have rich overseas affiliates and those things so they are okay. But every time I go west, they are the ones I see working. I see Adra from the 70's Adventists. I see Salvation Army. I see the Anglicans. I see the Catholics. I see the United Church. I see Pocomania. I see Revival. Well, we're not too sure who got the support yet. Don't know if it's Spokomania or Revival. So what did we say? What did we say they must get? No. What did we say? They are multinational corporations. MNCs. Yeah, who don't pay the taxes? Why give them taxes?
