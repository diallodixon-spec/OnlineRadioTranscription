And we can't dance the day you want it If you want it I'll be dancing If you want it, scream it, shout it, play it We could try If you want to make it, keep it in your nose I'll get you all the money You can see my heartbeat tonight I can take the heat, baby, best believe that's the moment I shine Cause every romance shakes and it burns, don't give a damn When the night's here, I don't do tears, baby, no chance I could dance, I could dance I could dance
