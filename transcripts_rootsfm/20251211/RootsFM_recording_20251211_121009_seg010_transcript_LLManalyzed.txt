We ask the lord god for deliverance. We ask for a miracle. We ask lord god to set in water today. Lord god olive oil, papers. Lord god I pray lord god may grant him favours today. Breathe upon it lord god. Make it so god to deliver the water. Make it so to help it. Let the enemy be turned backward, put to confusion, that desire thy hurt. He that when this sickly place of the most high shall abide shall be almighty, God our refuge, our fortress. God will I put my trust, trust that I deliver thee, for I see I have fallen as an pestilent, I walk it in darkness, covered thee with his feather, and his wings shall doubt, trust that she shall be like she am butler. Don't be afraid for a terror by night, not for the arrow that falleth by day. Lord, enlighten my salvation. Who shall I fear? Lord, the strength of my life. Who shall I be afraid? They say when the wicked leave my enemies, for came hope on me to eat up my flesh, though stumble and fall. The one who should rise against me shall not fear. Who should camp against me?
