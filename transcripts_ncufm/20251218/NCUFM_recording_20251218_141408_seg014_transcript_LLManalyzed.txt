20251218 141408 handbrake for the day. So yes, that's what we have in store for you this afternoon. I'm Matthew J. Wright. I am your chauffeur for the drive. I'll be keeping you company. And by the grace of God, guide us all safely to the end. I want to say good afternoon to Linda Ming and Sister Levi. I see you request Sister Levi. I'm gonna work that out for you. I'm afraid not man. But until then, until we get to 2.30 with our daily devotion, I'm gonna take a wellness bite and have you enjoy a bit of C.C. Wynand. Who don't love C.C Wynand's music eh? So keep back, relax and get ready to go as we get on to the musical highway. Blessings.
