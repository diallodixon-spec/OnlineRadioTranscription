20251229 154226 Come off, please. Not sure with this anymore. I'm not processing this right now. I need to take a break. How can I tell the difference between taking a break or just giving up? No, giving up means that you're never going to visit, revisit it. Resting means that I have done all that I possibly can do and I'm not seeing the result I'm looking for. So I'm going to take a break and I'm going to evaluate what I've been doing and see if there's something else I should be doing. Rest is very important. My husband and I, when we were coming, we were just talking about it. God who made the entire universe rest.
