20251217 215833 As a newborn soul sings I have been redeemed That's his favorite song of all If his song of God redeems When lost sinners come in need Let their voices loud and strong When those purged by his blood Lived to him a song of love I say, boy, he'd rather hear Than to weep into his, had his favorite song of all. It's not just melodies and harmonies that capture his attention, It's not just rave lines and praises, it all leads him to stop and listen.
