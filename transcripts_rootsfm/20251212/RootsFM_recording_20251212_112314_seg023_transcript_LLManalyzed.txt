2025-12-12 15:42:22 As a matter of fact, Chronic's song from his Exile album is called Resilience. And before we close off and go into the song, I want you both to address this whole idea of resilience. That's why we're down here. It's a second annual wellness fair. People in the community, they want to know about resilience. And they're doing it, some of them. Nobody is born with resilience. None. None. It's a skill we acquire. And guess what? It is by going through the fire that we acquire resilience. True, true, true. If you notice, it's from welding. Something breaks, and this is where it is welded. It's actually stronger than the rest of the material. So when you go through something and come out to the other end and survive, it makes you stronger. And especially if you now draw the lessons from it. That's important. Draw the lessons. Get the lessons learned. The lessons are important, yeah. And you know what I want to say.
