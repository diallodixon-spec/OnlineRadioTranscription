20251216 182211 But you're back on my clothes in a garbage bag You put it on the ground by the roadside You tell me got out your place to come inside Baby don't do me that, you're gonna break my heart Can't believe you're ready to give up on me many moons to find you Baby, the sugar on your skin The sweetest melanin, yeah See when you step out into the light And your body looking right No constellation in this sky Could ever take your shine I'll travel a million miles Just to look up on your smile Baby, look up to the clouds right now Say it to me
