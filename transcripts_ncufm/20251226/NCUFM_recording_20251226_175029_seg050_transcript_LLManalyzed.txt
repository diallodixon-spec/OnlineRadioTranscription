He's watching me. Yes, he's watching me. He's a busy God but on his list of things to do. His number one priority is watching me and you. He's taking care of business, eating birds and making rain. But he'll stop what he's doing when I speak his name. He's a busy God, but on his list of things to do, his number one pride.
