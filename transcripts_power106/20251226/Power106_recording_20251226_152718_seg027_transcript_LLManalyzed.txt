20251226 152718 I try to change the world I brought you to. Now there isn't much more that I can do. But I would if I could. If I could, I would try to shield your innocence from time But the part of life I gave you isn't mine I'll watch you grow, so I can let you go If I could, I'd help you make it through the hundred years
