20251219 192920 what I'm about to do. It's time to let the old me die. Mistakes in love I gotta choose. I know I said that I was gonna change a long time ago. That's what I said I said I said. Guess it takes some getting older for a real man to grow. Now I know it ain't never worth your heart. It ain't ever worth your tears. It ain't never worth those scars that I'm not here. I need, I need. I need. You. I need. I want you. I need, now, I know. I need. Now, I know, I need. Try to be in it.
