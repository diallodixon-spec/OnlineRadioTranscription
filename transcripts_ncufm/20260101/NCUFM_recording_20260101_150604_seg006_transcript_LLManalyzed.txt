20260101 150604 I call the show, Take it Easy Thursday. Somia is saying, Michael, happy, happy new year to you and your lovely wife. By the way, for those of you who don't know, that was my wife doing a Faxon 5 just now. Yeah, thank you, Johnny Lee Forsyth. Yeah, so happy new year to your lovely wife and to the Drive Time family. I'm enjoying the drive, says Somia. Thank you for the wonderful, spirit-filled year that we had in 2025, and we hope 2026 will be greater. By the grace of me take quickly take a look at some of the messages that came in earlier. Sister Glennie Smith right around devotion time saying amen. Happy new year Michael. Nuff nuff love and blessings from Joy.
