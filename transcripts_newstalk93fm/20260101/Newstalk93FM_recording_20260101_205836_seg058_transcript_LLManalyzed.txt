20260101 205836 I know better, it not easy Time testing but I'm strong With love on my mind, love in my thoughts carrying on Why nobody no believe in a love again? Because every love that lost Nobody no believe In a God again Seems our faith is lost Nobody no believe And it hurts my heart Turn the lights on the world so dark Still I believe That love is everlasting Yes I know Love is everlasting. Yes, I know. Love is everlasting, yeah. I believe. Love is everlasting. I know love is everlasting.
