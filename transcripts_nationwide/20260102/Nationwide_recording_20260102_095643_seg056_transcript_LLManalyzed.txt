20260102 095643 What kind of phone is it? Samsung A05 It's not a top-of-the-line phone but most people buy that phone It's a regular phone for the normal people. All right. So he'll tell me that the phone is no good. So I went out with my chip because I bought my chip from about $2,001. So I gave him my chip, no good, so I went and bought a next chip. And when I put in the next chip, I get in poor service car. I used to get so much job cars, but I'm getting a lot of job cars now. You understand? And the service, it's still not getting sufficient data. I'm calling about the jail command, and I can't get him. I don't want him to block me, I don't want to say I'm professional. But I'm calling him back to tell him that I changed the chip and all them things, and I'm getting work.
