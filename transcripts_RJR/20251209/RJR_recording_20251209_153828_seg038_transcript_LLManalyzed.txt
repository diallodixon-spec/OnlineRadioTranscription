Black River but when I started making jewelry I didn't know that it's kind of late a couple years later I realized I don't even remember how I found out but but yeah he was a metal smith and jeweler in Black River as well so it was just a special moment to realize that this has been in my family so you don't even know where it's manifesting from but you felt felt an urge to do it. I know you've discovered that your great-grandfather used to do jewelry making. It's in your DNA. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's excellent. So tell me about your work. What kind of materials do you use? What kind of jewelry do you make? So I use mainly copper, brass, aluminum, and sterling silver, among other materials. And I make all kinds of jewelry, bracelets, rings, necklaces, earrings.
