You know, just some jurisdictions, you simply don't have the bodies to come to the court and be selected for jury duty and pointing out the fact that, you know, the more defendants you have, the more persons you will need. And particularly in this Manchester case, there are seven defendants. So even just the amount of persons that need to be physically at the court significantly increases in that case. You know, and on that point, I would like us to segue a little bit in terms of the importance of public education, civic knowledge, and engagement. So if you realize, listeners, we have invested a lot here at the JFJ in public education.
