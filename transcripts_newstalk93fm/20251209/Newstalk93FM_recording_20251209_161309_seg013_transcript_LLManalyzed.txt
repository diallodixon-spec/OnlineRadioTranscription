============================================================

You're listening to Sleek Radio, 93 FM. You said your phone was broken, just forgot to charge it. Whole outfit you're wearing got, I hope it's ironic. Did you just say you're finished? Didn't know we started. It's all just so familiar, baby. What do you call it? Stupid. Or is it slow? Maybe it's useless, but there's a cue to work for it. I know. Man child, why you always come running?
