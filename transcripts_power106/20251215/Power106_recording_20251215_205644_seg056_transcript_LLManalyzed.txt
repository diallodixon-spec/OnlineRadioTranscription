20251215 205644 I love to lead the way whenever you love There's nothing better than love What in the world could you ever be thinking of? It's never my fault So let yourself reach for that star And go no matter how far To the one you love You know for love I'd go anywhere I would go there For love to the end of nowhere It's for her love I would go there
