If you want to dance the night away One dance in a lifetime, baby So don't feel away You don't like the fast life You look on the bright side I go take the blame I just want you come and bite the dust Just a little winding up Come and meet me at the end of the truck and we rev it up All day I feel your frequency from miles away You come alive with one wine, baby With you I want to dance the night away One jam to my lifetime, baby
