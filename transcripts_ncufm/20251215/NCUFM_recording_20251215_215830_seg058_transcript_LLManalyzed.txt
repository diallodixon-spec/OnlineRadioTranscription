20251215 215830 Help us to remember Lord. Also have trampled your commandments. Ignore your warning. Even at time. Repulse your pleadings. For you the eternal Joseph, by your mercies, who are before you. May you remember tonight to God as we view our day, tonight as we plan for tomorrow by your mercies. May you remember the do unto others, as we have them do unto us. Help the Lord a song that says be like Jesus, this is my song. Help that someone tonight might know that you the glorious and merciful God who changes not. You have us to be like you. You have given us the opportunity and the ability to be like you in all matters. So, here and now, God of heaven, contribute your lord and king and may we be worthy servants in Jesus name. Amen.
