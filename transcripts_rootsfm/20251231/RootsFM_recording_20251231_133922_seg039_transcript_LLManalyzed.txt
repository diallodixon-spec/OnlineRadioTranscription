20251231 133922 Come on, come on Baby, since I found you They said I'm not the same But they don't know the feeling Every time you call my name Oh, now I know I'm jolly So happy, so excited Just the way I'm feeling And I don't wanna fake it You're so so magic, you're like music. You put the words into my song, yeah. You're magic. You're like music. Now I know that we belong. Cause I can't stay away from you. You can't stay from me. We've got the love that grows and grows. Together we should be. I can't stay away from you. You can stay away from me. We got the love that goes and grows. You're the one for me.
