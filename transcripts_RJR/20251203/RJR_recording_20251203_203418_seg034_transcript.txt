Go get it, because the world is waiting on me now. That's right, we have to go on and on and on. And on and on. No time for living, no time for calm, even through the storm. We come and come, we go on and on, and on and on, on and on. Not time for evil, not time for war. I saw my things set now. Yeah, we want things to last, so me have to work for me youth. Me not parl about money and gum Look on the life, we're living. Now look on me. I'm a bit high from the landlord. We call me old, but old man's rent. We cannot come, you know, have a red cent.
