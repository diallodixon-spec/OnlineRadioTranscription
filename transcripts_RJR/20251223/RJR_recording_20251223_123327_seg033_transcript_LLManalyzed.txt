20251223 123327 Let me wish everyone the best for the holidays. Some mornings I watch and listen to news and see so many ladies crying for help. Some have one, two, three and four children. But where are the father some mornings? What a sad state of affairs. These women didn't make these kids by themselves. Have a blessed day ceremonies. This is from Lloydshaw in Montreal, Canada. Alright, and this one says, I'm going to bring it up some more. Good morning. My name is Raphael and I'm living in South East St. Anne. And what that gentleman from Monte Cabello is saying about RGI having the same problem. The radio is just cracking up and I myself only listen to two radio stations, RGR and a gospel station. I'm so disappointed with the situation knowing that all my life I've been listening to the stations and I can't enjoy myself listening to my favorite stations.
