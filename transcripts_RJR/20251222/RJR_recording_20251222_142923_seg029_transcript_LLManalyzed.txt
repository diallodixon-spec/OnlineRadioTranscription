20251222 142923 Still loving this one from Renegade, done from 2022. Did you see the fight between Jake Paul and Joshua? Just snippets of it. You didn't see it? Nah. Well, I'll tell you. Jake Paul got his jaw broken. I didn't see the entire fight. I just saw snippets of the knockout. Oh, wow. Yeah. Jake Paul could see the knockout before he got knocked out. That's the part that stuck out for me. You could see when the man sized him up, because he's in the corner, right? And the man size him up and get him ready. And then you can see the punches. You can see when Jake Paul's eyes popped out, like if I said, Mr. Punch, you know? No, listen, but I just posted a photo. I showed you a photo with Jake Paul in his private jet with his money splatting around him and saying, yeah, I got a broken jaw, but look at the life. Come on now, who do you want?
