Melissa volunteers in the community who went out and cleared the roads voluntarily and who have been working in the shelters to look after those persons that are still there at this time. One is unable to look after himself, so he has to be further cleaned and all of that. So we see it fit to honor these persons as well. And we, instead of having the sale of meals, we will be giving a free community meal.
