20251216 161108 Oh Show me that I will rule. Yes, I will rule my destiny. Will rule my destiny. Rule my destiny. That I will rule, yes I will, rule my destiny. Teach me thy ways, O Jah, I will always walk in thy truth. Give me a part to praise thee, and to furl thy name. Blessed are the merciful, that they shall obtain mercy. Consider my affliction, O Jah.
