20260101 192820 On this year, January 1. You're standing by for the JIS package. Coming up at 7.30. As always, Techie T's on the road, Zareh. And stay with us right here on the 94 as we keep you abreast of all that matters. I'm Shavani Blair. Make it a great year. Check up on your peeps to see how they're doing. Give them a call, a text perhaps. Stay connected this year. Let us love on each other, alright? Thought of a link at the back of the rail soon. Until then, many blessings. I love you for listening. Bye folks!
