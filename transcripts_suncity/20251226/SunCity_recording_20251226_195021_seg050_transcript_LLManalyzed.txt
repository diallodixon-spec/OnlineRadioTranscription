All they do when it's Christmas, Jesus. It's Christmas time again! All they do is when it's Christmas. Everybody just praise, praise, praise. Praise, praise, praise! Shout hallelujah, praise, praise praise, praise praise praise. Come God, please save y'all. So even if you're feeling down. Feeling down, down, down. Jack Jackson here. Son Jack Friar.
