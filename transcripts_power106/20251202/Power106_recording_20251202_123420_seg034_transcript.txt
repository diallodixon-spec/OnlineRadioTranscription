============================================================

It's too late When we die to admit We don't see eye to eye So we open up a quarrel Between the present and the past We only sacrifice the future It's the bitterness that lasts So don't yield to the fortunes You you sometimes see your fate You may have a new perspective on a different day And if you don't give up and don't give in, you may just be okay
