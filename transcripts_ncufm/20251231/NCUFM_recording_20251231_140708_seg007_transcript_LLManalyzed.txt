20251231 140708 As I'm full-on blessed blessed New Year's Eve. Good afternoon, Brother Michael, Joni and all drive time families. Welcome to the final Foei Wednesday for the year 2025. And we are so thankful that we are spending it with our very own driver, Mr. Michael Forsyth. Brother Michael, I don't remember if I tell you, welcome back, but welcome back, sir. And we are so happy to spend the final day of the year with you. So let us all enjoy and be blessed. Bye.
