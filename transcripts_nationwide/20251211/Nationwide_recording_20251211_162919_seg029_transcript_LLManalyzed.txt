2025-12-11 16:38:12 Excuse me If you see me screaming Teeth in my mind I'm only dreaming Cause if I wake early in the night Not by my side I feel like half of me Is no longer alive So please Charlie, before you walk out that door movie Would you listen to my song? Wait for me, I give you one last chance With the devil, you can know longer bend You got to be faithful, so we could be fruitful Be in the family, and follow God's destiny So just before I run to the block
