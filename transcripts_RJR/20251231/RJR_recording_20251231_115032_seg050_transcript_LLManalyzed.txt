20251231 115032 crimes. What's your take on that? All right, there are two things though. One is not the enemy of the other. Let me explain what I mean by that. In the same way that you would have the statistics going down, and you can take credit for that, but also, and I take your point, if the underlying causes are not dealt with, you run the risk of those numbers going up. That's true. Exactly. But that's not to say though, that if it is going down, you're going to not say, well, these are the things we have done, and we take credit for that. And so how sustainable those efforts are is another thing. You see what I'm saying? So I wouldn't cry the statistic. What I would say, and I join with you on this, is that if the underlying issues are not being dealt with, either for domestic or other kinds of violence, then you will always have that possibility. So the sustainability of what is happening is what's important.
