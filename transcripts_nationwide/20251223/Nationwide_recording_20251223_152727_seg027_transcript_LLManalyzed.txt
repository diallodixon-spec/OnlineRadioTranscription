Without putting in the work that that person has put in so when we the dance on space keep throwing around these titles Because we feel like we are the best at the moment or in the moment it's disrespectful the more you abuse a sacred title is the more the title starts to have no value whatsoever there will and will always be only one goat in dancehall it's shaba it can't change there is nobody who is going to come in dancehall and do what shabba did he did it already he did it at a time when it could not be done or was not being done make it make sense how are you now going to turn around and use the word and when we start using the word go loosely i don't understand that i see that
