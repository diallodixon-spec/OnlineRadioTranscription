I could be a fantasy, I could tell you got big, big energy It ain't too many of them that can handle me But I might let you, the Hennessy Make them sing to this pain like a melody And if your girl ain't right, I got the remedy It ain't to many of them that could handle me Babe chick, I could be your fantasy Oh when you walk by every night Talkin' sweet and lookin' fine I get kinda, have to come and see this Pretty like no no I'ma be your fantasy, you ain't gon' believe this
