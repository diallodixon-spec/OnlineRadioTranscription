20251218 171414 I'm a bit disappointed but understanding we're in Christmas season, the logistics of coordinating and getting everything done still has been done in record time. We only got cabinet approval two Mondays ago and JPS only got their approval from their board last week. So to be in this position tonight is huge and it is a recommitment of us being able to give the people light, some by Christmas, some by New Year, pushing the total number of foreign linesmen deployed so far to approximately 228, surpassing the initial projections.
