Driving through Kingston, who do you listen to? Roots Affirm, y'all. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas, bruh. Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas! Christmas without you With caroling and mistletoe Children playing in the snow But in their hearts the world is snow There's no Christmas without you Your gift? Your gift of love
