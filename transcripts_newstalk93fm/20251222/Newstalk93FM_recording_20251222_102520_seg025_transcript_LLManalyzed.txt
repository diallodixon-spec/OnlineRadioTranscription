20251222 102520 Deep as the blue sea, your love's flowing into me And even though the waves are rough, this love is tough, just love me Deep as the blue, deep as the blue sea Love me really, actually And this emotion. Like an anchor, you keep me safe. I'm not afraid of the ocean. I keep you warm and cozy. You'll be coming on me arms when the storms approaches. So why funny when all of us think like the tides are neat? The lighthouse, we are where I fall in. Deep as the blue see. Your love's flowing into me. And even though the waves are rough, this love is tough. Just love me. Deep as the blue sea, deep as the blue sea. Love me really and truly. And even though the storms will come, no we won't.
