20251229 144325 title's office is going to tell you, you're going to get a copy of your title, you know, but it's going to say that it's been canceled. So that's how you know that someone has been able to obtain a title for your property. And I keep saying your property, but it's really, it is no longer your property because once someone has made a successful application for adverse possession, you're no longer the owner, you've been dispossessed. They are now the new owners of the property. But like I said, you can go to the title's office. They're downtown Kingston. I think they have branches in Montego Bay and Mandeville also. And you can do an online search. You can go to nla.gov.jm, put in your volume and folio numbers or your valuation number. You pay $500 or $1,000, Jamaican dollars, depending on the type of search you're doing. So please don't be complacent. Don't just think because you're paying your property taxes.
