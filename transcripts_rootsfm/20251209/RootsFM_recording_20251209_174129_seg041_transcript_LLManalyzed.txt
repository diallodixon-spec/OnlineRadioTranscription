Y'all, you're listening to Roots FM 96.1. So I have to pick up every youth when duty is seen Get up every day and do the juggling Don't stop you, go and do your thing Man have to work, man have to work Sit straight in the shop and do your thing Stand up all day and do the juggling. Don't stop girl, go and do your thing. Happy work, man, happy work. Bills give you $1.50, give you $20. Make a road till the basket empty. Make a make a muscle even though it's not plenty. Now watch your face.
