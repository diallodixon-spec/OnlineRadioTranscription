20251229 194132 our children are denied those opportunities through no fault of their own. And Mrs. Barker Dunn, for parents listening right now, how can they support their children in becoming better readers at home? I would just want to say to them, even if they themselves cannot read, just ensure that they have a book, a reading book. Carve out a time in the evening that you then sit down and do homework. Get them reading. Reading is a culture that you build. Students must be reading. It's like riding a bicycle. The more you do it, the better you get at it. And I think it is one of those loft hobbies. People are no longer reading as they used to. So I just want to encourage parents to just get students reading again. I don't know, I didn't as a child, I'm still reading even now. You want to encourage every child to just parent to ensure that they get their children reading.
