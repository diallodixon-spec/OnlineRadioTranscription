Unfortunately, yes. So we have to have a continuation on this program because I really want our listeners to understand the capabilities and also understand what it is that they as drivers should be doing and passengers as well know that it is that persons are hearing know that everything is recorded in this black box because it is for their safety as well. And we also want to look further as to we spoke about illegality. So want to look on that aspect of it but when you return we have to have a continuation of this program all right but thank you very much ken you it yeah welcome and yeah man and again we apologize but we are out of time no man. All right, then. Thank you. All right. We have to leave that program here for today. We want to thank Mr. Kenny with your Chief Executive Office of Tampa Consulting for joining us as we look at the black box that is in our motor vehicle and the importance of it and its capabilities will continue
