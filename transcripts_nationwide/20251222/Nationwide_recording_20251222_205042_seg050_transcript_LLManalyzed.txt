20251222 205042 You can feel this feeling all around the world It's okay, if you feel it Forget everything and everybody Go to classes yourself apart in me and you Get out of your mouth don't call me that name Instead of bring me joy you brought me pain Now I really know what is the game Bus your brain Blood for stay Sometimes I really thought your love was so true Cried on my shoulder but that's all true Now I really know just to do Forget you too You and your cool people keep on telling me your love is here to stay But I keep on telling them that you will go away Cause what, two wrongs can't make no right Nah, ain't nothing wrong with the way you act
