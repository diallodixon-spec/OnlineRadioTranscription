20251230 192514 I got me Emily. I did it. I'm still with you. Are you asking for pictures? What's your name? I'm trying to be cool like you. Wobbling around in your high-heeled shoes. I'm clumsy. Made friends with the floor. Two for one, you know a boy by four. And two left feet, you know I always drop. First thing a girl did was a bop on the whole deal. Cake and a cherry on top. Shook up the bottle, made a good girl pop. You ain't even here to party. Ken in the crib trying to pick up a Barbie. I don't want to go, go, go with the flow back until I touch my toes. And I don't wanna go, go, grow to grow. Wrists full of rocks, and I hope I float. Wake up yourself, because you know they don't. I chew, chew, chew'm a bitch, I'm a boss I'm a shine like girls, I'm a b-b-b-boss I'm a bitch and I'm a boss and I shine like girls
