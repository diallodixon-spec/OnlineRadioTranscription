20251219 100501 Through love, wisdom, commitment, focus, action, and overstanding, I and I must achieve a spiritual renaissance, economic revitalization, and mastery over substance. The Zanli father, the earthly mother, and I are one. Health, wealth, and prosperity are I and I natural birthright. Blessed be the union that brings us abundance and opulence in all things divine. Let the words of I in thy mouth and the meditation of I heart be acceptable in thy sight, O divine father and mother.
