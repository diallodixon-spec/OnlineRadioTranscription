20251215 183924 The gas station down the road in St. Elizabeth completely gone just before you reach the little corner where the people them sell their shrimp. The gas station gone. So the taxi man not trying to drive either couldn't do it nowhere to get gas. The closest gas station available when I was there was Montego Bay. We had to drive Montego Bay just to get gas to come back home to Kingston instead of South Coast. So if you think about that and understand the plight of the people down there, it's like, yo, how are you celebrating when we're not living? Better you come down here and give us some of that money. I mean, I'm still, I would love to criticize the government and say, boy, I don't know about them fireworks, you know. I understand the mental need for some amount of celebration, but I may prefer if you give, if you told me you're giving everybody, you know you know a gallon bottle of sorrel and Christmas cake because at least that may feed a couple people and seeing pretty lights in the sky for a minute or two you know you know so I do think the government is making the right decision I do appreciate and understand the land outside
