20251215 160503 I'll be by your side no matter the case We have a one way ticket to greatness, greatness You're not the one to lie Cause I believe in the truth And I just wanna live good I don't want no dirty secrets fighting me and you boy I could only drive one car at a time But I still want to, but I still want to And let me get to the truth, truth, truth I just want to live good, good, good Look, the sun could shine the same time with the moon Boy, I could only drive one car at a time I tell you but I still want too But I still want too I always say, hey, set up yourself now. Brace yourself now. This kind of truth good for your health now. I know it might hurt up your head now. I hope I didn't set up myself. Love comes from a place where we don't get jealous. And we don't live like no dream sellers.
