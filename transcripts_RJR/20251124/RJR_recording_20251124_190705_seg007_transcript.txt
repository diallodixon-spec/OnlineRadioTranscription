Many rivers the cross And it's only my will That keeps me alive I've been licked, washed up for years And I merely survive because of my pride. But loneliness won't leave me alone. It's such a drag to be on your own. My woman loves mentioned this is a ride. Well, I guess I have to ride many rivers across.
