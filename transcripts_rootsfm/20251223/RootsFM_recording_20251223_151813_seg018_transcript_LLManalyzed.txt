20251223 151813 Hello, saying you can only stay a while. Hey, I know that it's hard for you to say the things we both know are true. But time has gone away. I keep forgetting we're not in love anymore. I keep forgetting things will never be the same again. I keep forgetting how you made that so clear. I keep forgetting, babe. Every time I hear how you never want to live a lie How it's gone too far You don't have to tell me why
