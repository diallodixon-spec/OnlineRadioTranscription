20251222 174420 I wasn't expecting this Falling in love this way From out of the blues you stole my heart You aim and shot a throw, and every day I'm praying. Every day I'm praying we will never part. Bullseye, you hit me right between the eyes with your sweet love What a shot I've never got enough It's Rewind Monday Monday Monday Monday Rewind
