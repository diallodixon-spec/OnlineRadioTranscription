I remember long ago How the party used to go Well, any time you come alive Was to hold someone and wine Now everybody on the phone Man, they can't leave it at home True, the party's shining bright Camera and video light It's only social media no social behavior. I wear your wine, my girl, I wear your wine. Stop the wine, my girl. It's only social media. No social behavior. Just wine. Take me back now. Take me back to the party. Take me back. Take me back long time. Take me back, take me back to the era Play like a woman and whine Take me back take me back to the party Take me back Take me back with the hands in the air For someone and whine Here we go, are we a whine on the field now? Are we a whine?
