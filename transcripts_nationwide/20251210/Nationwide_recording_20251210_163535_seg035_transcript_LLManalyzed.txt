Until the end of time And I own you back Your love is electric Your love is electric You make me so crazy You make me feel sexy E-L-E-C-T-R-I-C Love me, love me I feel like everybody moving I like the way you do it Every select I respect We are children of the music So play on and keep the beat moving This is where my life belongs Everybody cries along I could dance to music save my soul
