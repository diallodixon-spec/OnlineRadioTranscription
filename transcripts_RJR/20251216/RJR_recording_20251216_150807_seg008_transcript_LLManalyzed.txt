20251216 150807 Yeah, yeah. Holding you forever now. Yes, your love is for me. Me and only me. When I'm far away, I know you're lonely here. But your love is more me. Don't give it to nobody. I was away from you for quite some time now. So happy that I'm home. Would you love me still? But if me never had me own a house, that rent house me did live? Under that cadena, girl, would I still be your number one? Would I still be your winner?
