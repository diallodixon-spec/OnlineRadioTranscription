20251219 125739 really trying to test. You have to actually make the thing. You do, yes. And so, just before you guys go, overall, what has been, of course you're not completing, you have not completed your study yet, but overall, how has your experience been as students, undergrad and grad students here now? I would say extremely proud. I feel very proud to be a student, a graduate of the bachelor's degree from CSA. Similarly, yes. It is a lot of work and time and energy put in and I am just really glad that I was able to matriculate to the graduate program. It's much easier to have the great lecturers that we had before. I want to thank all of you for speaking with me here this afternoon and you know the entire experience. I'm also very proud as a Jamaican doing that we are building it ourselves and we are also building the builders and the conceptualizers. What good?
