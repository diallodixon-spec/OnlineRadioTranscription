20251212 132516 I'm buzzing with energy because I'm getting ready for the next booth that I'm going to. Alright, so we're just going to let you play for a little bit. We'll be ready for our next booth at 1.30. I'm going to check in with you again. But in the meantime, and between time, DJ String, the prince of afternoon radio, it's your time.
