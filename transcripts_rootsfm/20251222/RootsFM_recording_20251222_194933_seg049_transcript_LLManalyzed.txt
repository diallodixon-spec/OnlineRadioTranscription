20251222 194933 You put me easy and let me go I never was, you see, that cheatin' kind You feel all right, you never look for me So long as time, I've got to get on board. Sail it free! Sail it free! When I said it was over, you came down my heart. Won't be before I'm living all my life But I feel it forever, no sound in my life You can call back the living from my heart so free
