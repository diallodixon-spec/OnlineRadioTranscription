20251219 144028 I have been far No need for them another No need, no far Because I know Dutty I can sweep it up There I hide the peace I can't move A bit and slow it, way down, way up And I know dutty I can wash with soap The meditation is so blinding And they can't slow it down The people need the love, the people need the love
