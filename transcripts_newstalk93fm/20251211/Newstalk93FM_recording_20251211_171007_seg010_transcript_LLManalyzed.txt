2025-12-12 10:58:22 We're not feeling under the weather You just make me feel sweet Ice the cocoa tea, use the sugar And together we are complete,' Heat me up Only you alone can put fire back in the soul Heat me up And they tellin' me I should leave that fire alone Well, the more they tell me is the more I holdin' you close I could never let you go. Where you turn the top, make it smooth, my darling. When outside is pouring rain.
