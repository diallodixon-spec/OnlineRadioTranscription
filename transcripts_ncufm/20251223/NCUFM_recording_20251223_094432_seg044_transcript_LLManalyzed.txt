20251223 094432 How about five letters starts with J, savior of the world? Jesus. Oh, thanks. I feel so helpless. There's no one to talk to who has the answers. I just wish there was a way I could reach out to someone who could help. Six letters starts with P and ends with R, petitioning God. Prayer. I don't know. Maybe there's someplace I could go to, people I could talk to. Ends with H, place of worship. That's easy, church. Oh, right. It just isn't fair. We should have been given a manual or something that has the answers. Holy book. Starts with B. Bible. Come on, man. Think. Oh, yeah. It's so obvious. You sure know the answers. Maybe the answers you've heard time and time again are the answers you need to use. Another message from Lifeline Productions located on the web at lifelinepro.com.
