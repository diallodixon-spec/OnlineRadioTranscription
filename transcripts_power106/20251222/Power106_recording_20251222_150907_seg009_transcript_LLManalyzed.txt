20251222 150907 A lawyer listener from New York wants to know, or wants me to explain what a codicil is. All right. A codicil, so you have a will. Let's say you have your will. A codiceil is a second document. It's almost like an addition to your will, and it's read together with your will. So you write, you've done your will, let's say you did your will five years ago, and you say, oh, I now have this asset, I want to add it to my estate planning. You do a second document called a codicil. So a codicil is an addition to your will, and it is read together with your will. We rarely use codicils nowadays, rarely, rarely use it, because when someone wants to make a change or an addition, what have you, to their will, they simply do a new will. So codicils are perfectly legal. If you want to amend, if you want to add to your will, you can do a codicil.
