20251215 125342 The right one is the hardest thing I've done. If I knew that you were right there, then I'd never write this song. Joy is yours and mine. Story of our love, so divine. Look you in the eyes, the pleasure is all mine. Sing the chorus one more time. Say, Lord, I'm nice. So nice, so nice, so nice. Never catch a vibe that feels so right. When you're not around, I close my eyes and thank your service. Lord, he's sweet. So sweet, so sweet, so sweet. Every time he pass, me skin the teeth. Me and the melody and him and the beat are so sweet, sweet. You are the one, the only one me have to confess. You are the ones, so me not run out and test. All I wanna do, give my all to you. Oh, yeah. Oh, oh, oh.
