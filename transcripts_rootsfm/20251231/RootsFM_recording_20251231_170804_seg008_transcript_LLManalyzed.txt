20251231 170804 has been diverted to the program to allow households to be safely reconnected to the electricity grid. The support will include minor building repairs to facilitate certification, house wiring assistance, and electrical safety certification for qualifying homes. Mr. Vaz says the focus is on safety, warning that damaged wiring left unattended could lead to further disasters once electricity is restored. He says the intervention is part of recovery efforts following the impact of Hurricane Melissa in late October. Police are advising motorists that strict parking restrictions and traffic changes will be enforced ahead of the New Year's Eve fireworks display in downtown Kingston. In a public advisory, the police say no parking will be permitted along Palisades Road for the purpose of viewing the fireworks. Motorists who park along the roadway will be prosecuted.
