But with you, you, you, I could see what I need. I could dream realistically. I knew that this was different from the start. And it seems that every time we're eye to eye I can find another piece of you That I don't wanna lose And I'm staring at you now There's no one else around I'm thinking you're the girl I need I'm just saying it's fine by me If you never leave And we can live like this forever It's fine by me
