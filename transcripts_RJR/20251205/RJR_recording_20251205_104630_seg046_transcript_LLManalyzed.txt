It's on the pulse with public health on the hotline. We'll be taking your calls and questions in just a moment. It's 7 6 9 2 6 2 1 7 8 9 2 6 7 6 1 5. We're with the Minister of Health and Wellness, Dr. Tofton and Dr. Jacqueline Beceso-Mackenzie, the Chief Medical Officer. You were telling us, CMO, that you've had 71 deaths from pep leptospirosis as a result of... 71 cases. 71 cases. Oh, sorry. And how many deaths? 12 deaths. 12, of course, Melissa. Right. And then you were telling us that in 2024, you had how many cases? 127 cases for the year. And how many deaths you had in 2024? Any? I don't have the number for the deaths, but I don't think it is as much as we've had, certainly since Melissa.
