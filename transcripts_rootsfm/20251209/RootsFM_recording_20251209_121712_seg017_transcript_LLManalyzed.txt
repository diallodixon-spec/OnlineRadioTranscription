The theme for today will be Pass Me Not, O Gentle Savior. Today, we are challenged by the Word of God to ask Him not to pass us. Number one, as Jesus was passing by, Jesus did not just happen to walk by these two pair of brothers. He had every intention of inviting those brothers to become fishers of men. How much happens in our lives prepared and intended by God to help us follow Him more closely? And all we see is an accident or coincidence. Today ask the Lord when was the last time he just happened to pass by you and you did not notice me. Today we are also challenged by the gospel.
