20251223 145632 You step over the threshold into becoming who you want to become, listening, as you say, to your soul's calling. That's such a fantastic way of putting it. The family support is important. So tell me about your spouse, because he was here with you last Thursday. Yes, he was. He's very supportive, but he's a bit timid in regards to me being blatant about my ordeals and stuff like that. So he doesn't feel that you should be talking about some of what you talk about? No. But why do you talk about it? I talk about it because I think in hiding what you have been through, you're actually being fearful of your past. I don't think you should be or I should be. I think I should embrace my experience because it is through our experience that we gain inner knowledge, we gain inner understanding and we gain wisdom.
