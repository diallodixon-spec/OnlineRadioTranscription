20251219 164327 When I'm with you and ever enough so I'm not in a rush I can hear music and you're here tonight. We're rolling party to close in the finger. It's still frozen up in slow motion. I want to feel you over me Magic in your eyes And it happens every time When you will see me when you will see me i'm in west london this evening give me the feelings you're not leaving till i find atlantis we can get up now girl i'd rather go find somewhere quiet you glow
