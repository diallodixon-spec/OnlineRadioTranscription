20251224 191711 Hey, follow me now. So Christmas time is here again. That means so you're not a year ahead. So as you put it behind me, let's make it remind me. Next year is a new year. So this year remind you about no light. Next year, we're working for your better life. One year done, and next one come. Now we're nasty dumb. We're ready for the new year. And for the new year, we're better when you seek mistakes. And this year, we're not gonna repeat. Oh, last year was love, people, last year. So when the new year come, give thanks if you see it Even if this year it or next year as sweet You see what we plan this year Next year we reap, a crime free Christmas We ball into peace, all if next year is a leap We still a make money, we'll leave You know see, say Christmas time is here
