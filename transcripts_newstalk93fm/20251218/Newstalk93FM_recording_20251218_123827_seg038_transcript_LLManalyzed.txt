20251218 123827 The sea, the sky Pledge allegiance to your hands Your team, your vibes Don't care where the hell you've been Cause now, you're mine It's about to be the sleepless night You've been dreaming of Ophelia Tis locked inside my memory And only you possess the key No longer drowning and deceived All because you came for me Locked inside my memory and only you possess the key no longer drowning see it, oh. You took me out of my grave and saved my heart from defeat, oh. Oh, feel me out. Keep it 100 on the limit.
