2025-12-12 12:02:01 Hey, all of my life, I've never known you'd do this, babe. Fury makes me sick, and I wanna know this all day. You pushed me up this morning, and you're trying to be on my way. From my table, you've brought joy to my day. My life, yours, another, there's a change. And what the world, and what the world, And what the world. What the world is your gift. From my life, from every time you say. To revenge, hey, hey. What am I like? I'm different from you, man. You remain the same, man. What do you want me to do? Hey, hey. Hey, hey. Go to my life. I'm different than you, man. Do you remain the same?
