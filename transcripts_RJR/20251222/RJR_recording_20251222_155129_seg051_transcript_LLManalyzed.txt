20251222 155129 That explains it all. I say good afternoon to Ian Burch in Cocoa Walk, Salt, Manchester. So if there's one thing that can wait until next week or next year. Name one thing that can't wait until next week, or next year. Melissa, I'm going to be proud of you. You can't do everything. You can't prove it. One thing that can wait, until next week, next year, and I would prefer, next year not a set date anytime next year anytime the gift man the gift Christmas gift yeah the gift because we are putting emphasis on the dinner this year you know dinner yeah so the gift can't wait because maybe little things them maybe little things them gone up so the gifting we can cut back on that and use the money for two hours of food. No that's not the first time I'm hearing that from somebody actually because the person was saying you know this demand we put on ourselves every year to be giving everybody gifts when it was such a bad year right
