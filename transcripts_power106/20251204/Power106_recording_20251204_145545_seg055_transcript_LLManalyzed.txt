No winter, no cold Much better diving in the water from the boat Play the music loud, somebody pass the remote Everybody singing and they can't hold a note Rum a beat every weekend Swerve on me speech when me speaking Such a wonderful feeling All when Christmas I ain't leaving. It's good to be home when the lights are on the tree, the new world in the tree. When the presents are open.
