Fresh! Fresh. Fresh! Take up a rag, take up a soup, and go and hold it. Fresh. From your super cool and to your soup and fresh. Tell them how they're going to hold them fresh. Put the rag against the soup and rub it to make sure. Pass it across your bank and over your chest. Under your arm and over your neck. Put it in every creases with you, no dirt get your life away. No, she never give your life away.
