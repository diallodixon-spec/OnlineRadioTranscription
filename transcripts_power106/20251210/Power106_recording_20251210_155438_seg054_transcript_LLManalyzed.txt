All that remains to be seen starting at 6 o'clock in the evening tomorrow, Thursday, December 11, Jamaica time and good afternoon to supporters in the Diaspora as well. Hope you heard the tremendous commendation to the alumni and wider supporters in the diaspora of both these lovely institutions in Jamaica's primary school landscape. Mona Primary, or make that Mona Prep, Mona Preparatory, going up against St. Richard's Primary tomorrow evening. Sounds like it's going to be quite a competition, quite a culmination of the 2025 TVJ Junior Schools Challenge Quiz competition. All right, so we'll open the phone lines at this time, 876922411225. Oh no, before we do that, a bit more housekeeping.
