I feel of my mama how when she know a bitch she a give a lick of chocolate to a lick up a rich boy I live here time as good done and nothing we need for your fun it's like a family reunion we have in plus greetings that's 10 from fine every belly full from Christmas Eve and Grand Market we have to clean don't want no gun shot of us in the district put down your gun them place I make we have a crime free Christmas time Don't let violence broke the vibes No, no, no A crime free Christmas time don't let bloodshed broke the vibes no, no, no All I want for Christmas is to stay alive Can't let you sound them of the 45's All I want for Christmases is a new brand ride With a tick impressed inside Hold tight, hold tight, hold tight
