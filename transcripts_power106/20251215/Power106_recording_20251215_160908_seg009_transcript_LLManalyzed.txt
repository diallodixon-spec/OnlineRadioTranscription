20251215 160908 is that it's a it's a question sign it here a question asked you don't know yeah i'm looking at it now yes it's first corinthians 11 verse 14 yes all right let me say with due respect yes how could it be how could it be a shame for a man to wear long hair when jesus christ or Jesus Christ. Peter also say you never see about Jesus. Him we are long here. The Bible says that Solomon is the wisest of all, none before him and none after him. We are long here. And the Bible says he is the strongest man. We are long. So what I'm saying to most of our readers, I have a lot of respect for the Christians, because my sister took the monk from my grandmother who was a local preacher, you see what I'm saying?
