I'm not leaving, that's impossible to do. Because if you want me to go, you gotta be looking the way you do. You gotta be cooking the way you do Because you're looking at me Come on! I don't know what to do, so I'm pleading Plus you will give me no reason You tell me this is the end of the season Mash up, we think just just so But you don't understand when you watch me I said I'll split a dime in the electric How you gonna pick up just so And then dump me? No, baby Can't believe you're ready To give up on me, Gesso
