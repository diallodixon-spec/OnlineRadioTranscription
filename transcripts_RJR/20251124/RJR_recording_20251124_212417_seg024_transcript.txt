Thank you so much, Danny. A big classic back in the 80s for you. A group called Zoom, believe you me. Spring, summer, fall and winter. Getting into that time. We're in fall now. In fall or winter. What Anstu is falling is fall for me. It's not as cold as when the ice is on the ground, when the snow is on the ground. You can't turn into ice. A little colder, a little more dangerous too, right?
