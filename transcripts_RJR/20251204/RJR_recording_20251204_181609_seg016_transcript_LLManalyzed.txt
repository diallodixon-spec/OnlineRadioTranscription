students will be given an individual criteria for success on their day. Sometimes these criteria for success are altered based on the needs of the students.

So you have to make sure that is also there so you can actually build that critical thinking skills for them to actually become their best self. Can you give us an example of what you're talking about? All right, so let's say a math problem. Let's look at an algebraic problem. Sorry, sorry, sorry. Say you have me as a student. All right.

Alright, so if your work ethic is not good, what I will do with you, so sometimes you have to give them the bigger picture, why you need to learn.
