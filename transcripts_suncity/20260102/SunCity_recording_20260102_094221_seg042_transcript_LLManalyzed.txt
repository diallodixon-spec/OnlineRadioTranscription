20260102 094221 a little bit ahead of ourselves and we don't want other persons who need or is in need of help not get the assistance because of persons who become very creative in getting more than what they're supposed to. And I understand all of this, but I'm just wondering why it took so long to get here. It is the second day of January. This is going to be put forth in the cabinet on Monday. So that's a whole nother week again. And then now I'm going to assume that there's going to be the rolling out of the distribution. I am interested to hear how this is going to be done. They say it's 50,000, you know, over 50,000 homes damaged. I want to see how long it's going to take for them to get, you know, to rebuild all of that. I am a little bit nervous, but looking forward to see what the process is going to be and how long it is going to take. I think this has happened from October 2018.
