What are you doing? Friar, I get free time. It's my time now. So she's like, oh, yes, I'm just realizing the time. So she says to tell everybody, thank you so much. And she appreciates each and every message sent. All right. So everybody who told Raven Happy Birthday, she says she appreciates every single message sent, every voice note recorded and sent. She appreciates it and thank you so much. Yeah, man, Raven, pick up yourself, enjoy yourself to the fullest, you know. Just make sure that today, hey, Raven, make sure you're relaxing today. You're not doing anything, you know, that will accrue you up too much, unless it's something fun, all right? Yeah, it's your day today. No work, no working today.
