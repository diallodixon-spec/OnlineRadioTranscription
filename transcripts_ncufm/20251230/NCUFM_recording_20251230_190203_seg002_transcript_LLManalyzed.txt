20251230 190203 that I pray each and every day that you will guide my footsteps as I stumble and stray Lord, I need you to direct me all along life's way. Lord, be a pencil around me every day. One more time, sing. Be a pencil all around me everyday. I want you to protect me as I travel along the way Lord, cause I know you can and you're doing it I'll fight my battles if I just keep this Lord, be your witness all around me
