20251215 114738 urgent attention, urgent attention. I'm seeing some potholes in the major thoroughfare in downtown Kingston that is unbelievable, really and truly unbelievable. I hope we can get those things, you know, remedied as best as possible. And as I was saying that we're seeing where work are going on and some of the roadway in terms of the verges I'm talking about here now. And, you know, I'm not happy as to how it is being done. Don't know if it has to do with the supervision of what's taking place out there. But the persons who are, you know, tasked with the responsibility of supervising these work, I'm hoping that you will pay some attention.
