20260101 164942 I will follow him. Follow him wherever he may go. There isn't an ocean too deep. A mountain so high it can keep keep me away away from my love I love it, I love it I love it and where he goes I'll follow, I'll follow I'll follow He'll always be my true love My true love, my true love from now and forever Nothing you can take and tear me away from my guy Nothing you can do cause I'm stuck like glue to my guy
