20251224 162014 A very special Christmas from me. Presents and cards are here. My world is filled with cheer and you. This Christmas, and as I look around, your eyes are shut down too. This Christmas, myide is blazing bright. And we're caroling through the night. And this Christmas will be a very special Christmas.
