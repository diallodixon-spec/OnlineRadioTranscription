20251226 100505 My head and my mind were burning with desire And if ever I was given a chance Every bone in my body would be a fence Now baby, what do you expect of me? Now should I stand in the middle of the road? Let something run over me So that I can get your full attention Wanna explain to you You're the hit on every corner Gotta confess to you, yeah Just what you're doing to this brother You got my heart, my mind and my soul Hold burning with desire And if ever I was given a chance Every bone in my body would pass Don't let me cry to you For a bone in pride is a sign of weakness But I wouldn't lie to you, no That you'd be just right
