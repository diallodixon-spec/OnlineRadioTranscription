20251223 130505 When I went insane Took me from the depths When I lost my name Give me something I'm gonna live for Now everyone is wondering what's the change They don't recognize I have so much to say And I never thought someone could love someone so much that They'd give up on everything Do you know? I will be there when you need me I will be there, when you're crying baby I will be there where you need someone to tell you That you're beautiful, baby I will be that where you need someone, to run away I will be that when you need someone to dance with From your lover to the sky's thin gray girl Cause you're beautiful, baby It's you're beautiful, you're beautiful It's you beautiful baby It's you beautiful, it's you beautiful
