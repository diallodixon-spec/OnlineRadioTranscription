20251229 195841 As I can well recall how sad you were the first time that we met. Whoa. I told you before the week was through that my love would make a change in you. But I'm sure that you'll agree that it's a change you don't regret. Because when I look at you today, I see a different lady. Girl, you've come a long, long way. You're a different lady. And I love you, lady. You're on the morning.
