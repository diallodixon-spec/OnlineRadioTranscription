Junk of life, I'm far away from nowhere On my own, like taz and boy I don't see a plan no more I should cross the forest monkey business On a sunny afternoon Junk of life I'm living in the open Native beat that carries that carries all. Burning bright, I find a bloodstained signal to the sky. I said I wonder if this message came to you. Oh, oh, oh, oh. Oh, oh, o-oh, o-oh. Oh, o-o-o-oh.
