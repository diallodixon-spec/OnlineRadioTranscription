20251231 143719 watching you watching you watching you there you go swaying blowing my mind you've got everything moving in God save her beauty, she carries it well. I'm staring at your heart, baby, hoping you can tell. Walking down the street, watching ladies, go by watching you. Hoping you can tell that I'm watching you. Walking down the street, watching ladies, go by watching you. With the naked eye, baby, whoa. You're far away, but I can still see you clearly, whoa.
