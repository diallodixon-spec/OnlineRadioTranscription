20251217 210805 I have never had to ride in a one-horse open sleigh Or watch Santa Claus and his reindeer fly away We'll roast corn, our bread, fruit, our turkey for Christmas dinner Down in Jamaica, there's hot sunny weather And people are warm and friendly all the time Now it's the Christmas season, and before you're done So have a joyful, iry Christmas in the sun Oracle and Nick don't mean a thing to me I know about Zaren and Janko Loop and chatting together, oh yes
