You're right. You're right. Yeah, some people treat you like that. Gather and chat. We'll be back next week. Uh next week is what? Yeah, next week Wednesday. Before we go, let me implore the parents, the police, and the caregivers. Human rights, please. Absolutely. Parents, because remember, you have a lot of authority as parents, police officers, and caregivers. You are entrusted with the lives of people every day. 24 hours a day. Bear in mind human rights day is every day. Not just today when you celebrate it. Different from you, but don't treat them different. They are equal. You think they are different.
