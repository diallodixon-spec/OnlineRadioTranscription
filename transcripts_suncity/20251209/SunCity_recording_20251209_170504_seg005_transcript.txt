And now the news in detail, we begin with local news. Banana and planting farmers across Jamaica are being urged to register with the Banana Boards Catastrophe Fund as preparation begin for the 2026 Atlantic hurricane season. The fund, designed as a disaster recovery insurance scheme, provides support to farmers affected hurricanes, floods, windstorms, and other sudden natural disasters. Officials say registration must take place before the next hurricane season, which runs from June 1 to November 30 each year. Once the threshold is met, all registered farmers are eligible for payouts. The fund is currently assisting growers recovering from Hurricane Melissa's severe impact. Farmers interested in registering can contact the Banana Board.
