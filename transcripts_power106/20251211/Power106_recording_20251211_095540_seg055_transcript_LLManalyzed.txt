Information Update. Donovan Wignall is the immediate past president of the MSME Alliance and a for-branking member of the now-defunct EPOC, and he now joins us to talk about the proposal to amend the Income Tax Act in order to allow companies to provide $200,000 tax-free honorarium to employees who have been affected by Hurricane Melissa. Good morning, Donovan. Welcome. Yes, good morning, Dr. Ryan. Good morning, Rose. Good morning. How are you doing? I'm not bad at all. Go ahead. No, I said busy as a bee. Oh, well, that's good. Yes, yes. So, Donovan, what are your thoughts on this proposal, right, to have this income tax cut to allow companies to provide some honorarium to employees who have been affected by Melissa? Well, you know, prima facie, on the face of it, it's a very good proposal.
