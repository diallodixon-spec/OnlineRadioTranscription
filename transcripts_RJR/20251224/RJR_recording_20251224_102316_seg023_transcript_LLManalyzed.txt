20251224 102316 I hope that the Lord continues to bless you. Forty-odd years of being together. You are still there together through ups and downs. Praise the Lord. And I thank you and I just wish me some of that to hear. Alright my friend, take it easy and enjoy Christmas to me. Tell your wife, I hope she's listening. When you tell me about something that she's sorting out for you, it says that the wife is a good woman. Alright? Alright, and you're a good man too. Little more? Take it easy. Alright, that's it. Alright, bless you. Alright. Alright then my friend, take it easy, yes. Alright.
