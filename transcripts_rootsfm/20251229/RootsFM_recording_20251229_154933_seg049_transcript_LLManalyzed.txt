20251229 154933 This is not an easy game I'm longing to see you I wanna know how you've been doing over yonder I'm gonna catch this flight And when I reach my destination I hope you'll be smiling Longing to see me. Thought you'd drop me a line just to say hello, my dear. I'm doing fine. Doesn't matter anyway now, cause when push comes to shove, you might just blame the blame on me. Tired of taking the blame for something that I didn't do, y'all. Whoa, whoa, for loving you.
