20251215 093831 I went to the embassy last week. I was asked three questions. I answered them and I didn't get the visa. Based on the person said Nadine, when can I go back? But based on the fact that you went in for an interview, I'm assuming it's a US visa, so it would be opal. And then the person also said I waited two months to get an interview and still I did not get the visa. There is no guarantee anyway, especially for a non-immigrant visa. You know, the U.S. embassy reserved the rights, the consulate reserved the right to look at everybody's unique situation and see whether or not you satisfy them that you qualify. They will have to believe in their hearts and soul that when you get this visa, you're going to do it good and use it how you said that you were going to use it.
