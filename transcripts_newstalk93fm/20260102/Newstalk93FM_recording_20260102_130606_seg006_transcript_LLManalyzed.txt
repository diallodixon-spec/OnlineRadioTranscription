20260102 130606 I said load me up with the oil Everything had to spoil From grandma go down to child They been wanting this for a while When stars align, greatness outshines all hatred in space and time. So still we rise, with grace and with faith in the morning with chains and iron I am the backpacker now ready Rummin' me backpacker now ready From out of town laughin' already with a backpack on the AV, you know? They go out to put the jobs up on a bill All fresh like two days
