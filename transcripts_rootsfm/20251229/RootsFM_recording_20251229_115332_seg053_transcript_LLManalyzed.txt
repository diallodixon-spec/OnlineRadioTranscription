20251229 115332 day after day, by the many testimonies of your graciousness towards your people, even after the passage of Hurricane Melissa. And so Father, as we look back over 2025, we look back with joy and gratitude and thanksgiving. We bow before you constantly, and we lean on you constantly. We look to you. Our hope is in you. Because without you, we can't do it. We cannot go day after day without you. We can't make it day after day, without you. And I pray, my to God, for this country, Jamaica. I pray for the many families who live here and work here and study here and establish business there. I pray that as we continue day after day, mighty God, your care for us. Oh, mighty God, we continually be there. Oh, yes, we look forward.
