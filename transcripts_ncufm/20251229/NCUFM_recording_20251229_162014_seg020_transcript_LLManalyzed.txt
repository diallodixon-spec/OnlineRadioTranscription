20251229 162014 Take a moment and choose God's love divine. From the moment you're saved, how happy you'll be. Take a moment and live eternally, for heaven is free. How happy you'll be when heaven you'll see. I'm so glad that I know. Sweet peace and Wherever I go I'm glad to say My soul will fly over Chile and Jordan Over Jordan On wings of love I'll fly away No not a moment to lose Make up your mind Take a moment to choose God's love divine From the moment you're safe How happy you'll be Take a moment and live eternally For heaven is free
