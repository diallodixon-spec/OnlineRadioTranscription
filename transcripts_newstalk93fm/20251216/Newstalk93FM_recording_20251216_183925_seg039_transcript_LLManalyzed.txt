20251216 183925 And when your life gets lonely Please don't say you can't ruin me And if you ever need me I will be there Doesn't matter where, no way I will be dead Watch it in the man, watch it in the drain Oh, Lord, sound that string up The vibes we keep it up Anywhere we turn, everybody say pull up Pull up Now everybody say pull up, pull up. Now everybody say pull up. Pull up. Everybody say pull up pull up.
