losses have been incurred. We can't. If the promoters want raising the longevity of it, if they are in it for the long haul, I believe the most important people to sit with is the stakeholders so we can all understand not just to come in multiple public forums and speak about it, but to come and sit down with the group who is putting on the show and ensure that we understand why the losses are being incurred and what we can do to actually stem it. I think one of the most important things also is the CTL board. I think we need the CTL board in place to ensure that they can look at the lease that was offered to SVRL because I believe that is very, very important going forward. And I will tell you Cliff, we need to press the Minister of Finance to have a board, CTL board, in place.
