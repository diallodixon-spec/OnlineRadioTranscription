20251216 174227 Shout out to my sister Mrs Anne Marie Kelly in New York. Cheers to another wonderful year my sister. Enjoy your special day coming from your sister Joan, your niece Teresa and grand niece Gabriel. Gabriel, yeah man, it's Gabriel, it's Gabriel. Yes, good evening, good evening to you as the sun goes down. Sending blessings to Auntie Sharon so she's not going anywhere until we pull up the handbrake and she to praise the Lord.
