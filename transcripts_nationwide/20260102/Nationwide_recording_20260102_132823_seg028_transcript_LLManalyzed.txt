20260102 132823 I put the family first For better, for worse Who judge or bless, let no man curse I put the fam-ly first Though sometimes it hurts So glad we're together in honor Fog one sister It's been so long since we've spoken Though we're struggling in them systems Our spirit is still unbroken Fog one brother So glad you're looking after your mother And they say we're not getting any younger But every day we get stronger and wiser Trying to make things right Cherish these precious times
