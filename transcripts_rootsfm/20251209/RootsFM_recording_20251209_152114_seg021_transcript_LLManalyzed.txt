============================================================

I can't use that hangin' mind above the New York sign The day you walked into my life was confusing Now it was hard for me to see what you were usin' But since the time I found us all What's been done to me so many times before? Now baby, I ain't falling for that no more But you see, those mixed up rules and attitudes I don't need them Now I don't need that venom I'm born with it on the side Those mixed up rules and I can't use them. I sure can't use them, hang on now. I want to be on the side. One night with this perfect angel, then next to this silly, silly clown.
