See you at Reggae Wednesday. So many times. Now that you've gone, I'm gonna miss you so. But you should know I've been lost. And I dream of a broken heart. My world will fall all apart. And I've got a start all over. Crushed. Hanging on to shattered dreams. A dream that means so much to me. Just one more time, where it used to be. Yeah. I'm so sorry, lady. I'm sorry for you. I'm sorry. What?
