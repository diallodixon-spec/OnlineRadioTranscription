20251229 091511 This is no intention of being offensive to women by Kola Yawa. My down ass, my queen. Princess cuts look clean. On that finger next to the finger, you flip that knee. And there's no in between me and you, only me and you. Who else don't put it on you? Like the rule that God only looks after children and fools in your night. So who gonna look after you? Oh, baby. True, baby, it's only for you, baby. Feet are thighs, only divide if you decide. Because I love the way you touch me. Nobody can get it. And if it's gunning, just consider refitting. So when you gone for a minute, I just fantasize like if it's you, it's all in it Then I say it's fine till you come back to me Holding stacks and jewels V-I-T-A and my J-A, ooh baby I wanna be your chick I wanna be down for you Do you trust me?
