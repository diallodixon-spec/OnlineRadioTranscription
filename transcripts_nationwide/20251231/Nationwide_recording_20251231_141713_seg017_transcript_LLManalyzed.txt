20251231 141713 You're on the phone with your girlfriend, she's upset She's going off about something that you said She doesn't get your humor like I do I'm in the room, it's a typical Tuesday night I'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like And she'll never know your story like I do But she wears short skirts, I wear t-shirts She's cheer captain and I'm on the bleachers Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find it What you're looking for has been here the whole time If you could see that I'm the one who understands You've been here all along so why can't you see me?
