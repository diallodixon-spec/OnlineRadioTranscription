20251215 201614 I met this old man, he was so fun He didn't hold a baton, so he slept on the floor He's always smiling, I never heard him complain He said I've proven God again and again So no matter what the circumstances may be God is always there for me As we give thanks for yet another day. Starting off the work week. As for each day we give good thanks. Seeing us through the day.
