20251215 175437 He's director of Shabbat of Jamaica, the only Rabbi, in fact, in Jamaica. Rabbi, thank you so much. We appreciate you talking to us. Good evening. Terrible, terrible news coming out of Australia and especially on such an occasion, such a significant occasion in the Jewish community. Can you give us your own reaction to what you've been seeing unfold? We're devastated. Hanukkah is the festival of light, the time of joy, the time of happiness. Rabbi Eli Schlanger was a dear colleague, one of the victims, and his work is similar to ours, inspired by the same mission of sharing the joy and spirituality of Judaism with all. And that attack on the Jewish community of Sydney is an attack on Jews all over the world. We are one people. We mourn together.
