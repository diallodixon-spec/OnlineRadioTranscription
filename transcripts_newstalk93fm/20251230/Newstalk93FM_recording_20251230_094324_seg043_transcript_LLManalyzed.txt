20251230 094324 You're listening to Sleek Radio, 93 FM. The phone was broken, just forgot to charge it Whole outfit you're wearing, God, I hope it's ironic Did you just say you're finished? Didn't know we started It's all just so familiar, baby, what do you call it? Stupid Or is it Slow? Maybe it's Useless But there's a cue to work for it. I know. Man child, why you always come running on me? It's my fault.
