I've been born a long time, I know it's not going to go on, but I don't expect it to go on. If it's not going so hard, don't it? Yes, jump gear man, they're going too hard. They're going too hard man.. They make Dover race track look like it's nothing. Yeah, they go too hard. It looks like Vernon Field. No, it's Vernon Field that gets faster because it's straight away. But I get your point. They are going too hard man. They are going to hard, they are going to hard. I said I know you know because I'm not just born and I know how things sit. But I said that one is a lick too. I said when I see this man, I said no man. $300 one time. You didn't take time to put on one lick of 50. No, yeah, yeah. You just jump big so.
