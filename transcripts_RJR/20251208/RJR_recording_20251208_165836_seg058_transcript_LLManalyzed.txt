============================================================

original no counterfeit none of us don't deserve it I try me every day worship Even when I'm down, God, you teach me how to climb. Give me eyes to see when I'm walking like the blind. Purpose-driven living, original design. Can't separate the branch from the vine. You put the volleyball on a nickel, on a dime. Mercy. with me the one count a line. Christ save me, that's what me have to show you. Pull out like this. It is more than just a kiss. Pull up like this. Custom made to me.
