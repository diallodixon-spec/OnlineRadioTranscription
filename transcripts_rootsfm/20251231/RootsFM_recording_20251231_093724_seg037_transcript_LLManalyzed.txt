20251231 093724 I don't need it for tomorrow Just enough to get through this hour Whatever comes my way I'm not trying to be a hero. I'm just trying to survive To make it through the next few hours and still be alive Inside this weary soul that's barely holding on So I'm praying this simple prayer at the breaking of the dawn
