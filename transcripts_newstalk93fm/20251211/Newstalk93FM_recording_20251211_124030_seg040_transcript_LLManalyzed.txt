============================================================

How are you laying me down to a dead and buried? On the edge of your knife, staying drunk on your vibe. The angels up in the clouds are jealous knowing we found service to our ordinary. You got me kissing the crowd, sanctuary, trying to be what you're taught. Oh Lordek Radio, then lost. Nobody no believe, in a God again. It seems all faith is gone. Nobody no believe. And it hurts my heart. Turn the lights on.
