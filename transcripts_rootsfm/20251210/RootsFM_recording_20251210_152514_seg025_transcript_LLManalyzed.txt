I'm a girl, she got few guts blown with it. And if you're not so big up here, you can't grow. Magic, hey, hey, when you're near the soul with it, one pop, just hop and throw it. Throw it in the barrel, come in the load with it. Pick you up, here things don't flow. You know, the everyday, you got them honed with it. Great thing, now come in my zone with it. Bless God, your hips are blown with it. Let your family be dressed and mowed. Magic, head in the hood. Magic, here in the hood. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Rise up the heart, demand the endless heat. Bandits, family of countless leaders. Jamaica, Japan, France, and the Middle East. Maxi, Edna Wood, Maxi, edna wood. Joke about it, man. Maxi, ednna wood, Maxi ednna wood. What's up? What's up, edna wood? Edna wood, Edna wood. Get the man, come and dance with me. You're in this state, rules 96.
