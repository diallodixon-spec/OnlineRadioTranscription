============================================================

But I know now that I'm way down on your line She look so fine But the way things feeling fine She a one of a kind So don't treat me like a puppet on the street Don't pull me Cause I know I can do my thing Don't talk to me If you think I'm done I wanna know when you're gonna come All I know she haffi come with me Wanna take her down to Paris Take her down to Rome Take her to the beach and from there to my home Can't be thinner for only two alone. No disturbance, no calling on the phone. This is what my baby said to me, Lord. Oh dear Lord.
