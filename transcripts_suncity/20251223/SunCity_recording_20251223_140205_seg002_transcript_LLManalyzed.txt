20251223 140205 exposed to the singing greats, especially those from the Thalma Motums table, and as a result of the exposure and inspiration, Janet's love for singing was born. In 1977, whilst in Secretarial College, Janet was invited by her school friend to a band rehearsal. Destiny saw that band member Tony Gadd heard Janet singing in the rehearsal room. He was so impressed with the sweetness of Janet's voice that he introduced her to the reggae legend, the great Alton Ellis. That meeting resulted in Janet recording a cover version of Mini Ripton's Lovin' You produced by Alton Ellis, which became a reggae smash hit, spending many weeks at number one in the reggae charts. The following year, 1978, saw Janet record two more cover versions, I Do Love You, and That's What Friends Are For, again, both spending weeks at number one on the reggae chart.
