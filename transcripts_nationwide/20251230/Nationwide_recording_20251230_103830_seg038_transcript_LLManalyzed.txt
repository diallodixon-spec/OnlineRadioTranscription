George will bat first in the final round of today's competition. Gentlemen, the rules are for round one, one point will be allotted for each correct answer. No points will be deducted for incorrect answers. In this final round, we will allow the questions to pass for rounds one and two. Of course, round three is a buzzer section. In the final round, you have no lifelineeline for this competition today it's just you and your brain and there is no bonus question so nobody will be able to come back with an extra five points George is up first first question to you George
