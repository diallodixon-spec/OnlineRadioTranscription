Thank you, Siobhan. Good afternoon again. Good evening, listeners. I'm coming to you live from the Mona campus of the University of the West Indies, the undercroft, they call it, for a public lecture that's been put on by the university in collaboration with the Ministry of Water, Environment and Climate Change. Now, the topic of tonight's lecture is From Loss to Recovery, Financing Climate Change Resilience for Vulnerable States in a Post-Disaster World. It's set to address the irreversible impacts of climate change on vulnerable communities, with a focus on the role of the Fund for Responding to Loss and Damage, the FRLD.
