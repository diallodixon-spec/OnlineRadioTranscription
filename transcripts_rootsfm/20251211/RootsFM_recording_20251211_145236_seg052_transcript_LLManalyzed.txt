2025-12-11 19:26:02 It's a while since I've been trying to get it on with you But you keep on saying you don't know what to do Make up your mind and give it a try Now you know the score Cause girl, I've been knocking your door So leave it to time Time alone can do anything Time, time can move any the mountain Time, time will make you realize And I'll see the sign of the times That your mind was prophesied a long time ago
