20251215 122419 Now the liquor take all of me And the base knock my soul Out of my chest, so God won't let me leave I don't know if I'll survive Song after song, wine after wine I go sit strong and fit for life Weak like the masses, kryptonite You can't find me, we're bound for shaking I am eating, people fighting So complain, if they want to know Tell them, you can't find me out on the road I'm ready to walk, chest left full, time to free up Oh I lost all the road already Tell them that it's okay, I'll see you Wednesday I'm not coming home tonight, I'm not going home tonight
