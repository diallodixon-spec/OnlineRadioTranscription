I saw him last week and he said in another two weeks he's gonna be picking. That's amazing absolutely fantastic so when people come to the farmers market this afternoon are they going to be able to buy everything that you have? Yes sure they're able to buy what we have because we know we're in Kingston we have a lot of orchid farmers or orchid growers sorry we still have people from St. Andrew that are coming out so we brought along our products so if in case they need it they'll get it because sometimes when you come to the office you're not able to buy a single product you have to buy it by the case
