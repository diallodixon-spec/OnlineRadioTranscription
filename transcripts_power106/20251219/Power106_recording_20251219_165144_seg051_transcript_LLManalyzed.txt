20251219 165144 I'm also going to have some giveaways from Caribbean Chemicals that I will do for those of you who are not able to make it here. We're reserving that for you, those giveaways, so you can listen out for that. But let me tell you, this has just been a fantastic experience. I want to say thank you to our programs manager, Annika Nelson, who approached me with this idea of doing a farmer's market before the hurricane struck in October and I'm very happy that you were able to follow through despite the hurricane because it has offered to members of the public who pass our location day in day out an opportunity to come in and work with us in a different kind of way because here it is now they were able to come in and get their purchases all of our vendors or far or farmers they are very happy they are living here happy
