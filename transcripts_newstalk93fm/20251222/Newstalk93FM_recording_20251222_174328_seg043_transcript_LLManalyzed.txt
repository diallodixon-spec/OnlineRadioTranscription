20251222 174328 So don't feel away You don't like the fast life They look on the bright side I go take the blame I just want you come and bite it up Just a little winding up Come and meet me behind the truck and we rev it up Whole day keep throwing it back I know why you stop Baby no way We could post up all the pictures you want when you're ready. I go over here, darling. You go over there. But we could meet in the middle and start a bacchanal. Play in the middle, hey. What we go do now? Jam to a rhythm in the heat. I can't evolve, but in the heat, hey. What are we gonna do now? Start a wine on it. I say compromise on it. Baby, spend time on it. can we talk some business you know i want your company and it's nothing too risky limited liars
