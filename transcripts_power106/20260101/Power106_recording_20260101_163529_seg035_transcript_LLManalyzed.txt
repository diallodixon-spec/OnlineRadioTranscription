20260101 163529 Do you remember the first time we fell in love? You looked into my eyes Wipe the tears away The first time When we fell in love Although some time has passed, I still remember just like it was yesterday. But time is moving fast. The love I have for you Time won't ever change I'll always feel the same Now until the end Memories we share will live
