The concept of the wasteful output gap which rivals the cost of war was developed by Professor Paul Samuelson, former economic advisor to the late US President, John Fitzgerald Jack Kennedy. This concept flowed from his magnum opus, Scientific Analysis of Microeconomic Theory, for which he won the Nobel Prize in 1970. It measured the difference between the current and potential GDP, or the difference between what a country is currently producing and what it is capable of producing. Jamaica's fundamental economic problem has been the chronic under-production and over-consumption, particularly of imported goods and services, leading to the build-up of debt, which resulted in a panic and the aggressive and premature debt service payment by the current administration at the expense of the country's vital infrastructure and human capital. This is what contributed to the low levels of productivity and the infrastructural damage caused by Hurricane Melissa.
