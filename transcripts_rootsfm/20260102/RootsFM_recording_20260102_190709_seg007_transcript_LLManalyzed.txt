No time for waiting, baby. I got tending with loving, and I know that you won't regret. But the nature must have sent you here for me. I wanna be the first thing that you see. I'll be glad just to know that you feel like I do. So just hold me, baby, like I wanted to from the day that I met you. Come on and hold me, darling. Hold me, baby, real tight. The fantasy will fill by the end of the night. I love you, baby.
