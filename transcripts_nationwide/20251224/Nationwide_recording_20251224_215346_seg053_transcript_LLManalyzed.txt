So I almost feel like if, if, if it is a healthy perspective, meaning, you know, I just naturally want to, or a man just naturally wants to honor his mother and father, like the Bible says. And then of course the parent has that loose grip of letting them go and be who they are. It shouldn't be a problem. So I think like, I like a mama's boy because then you understand, as he said, what it means to love a woman. You have an appreciation. Cause there are a lot of men out there that they don't love women. They only love vagina. I'll tell you the truth. You know, so I can tell the difference between a mama's boy. Cause they actually like women. Them don't just want a woman to have as a girlfriend, but they actually like the company of a woman. They appreciate their mind. They respect their intelligence. And these are usually meant to me, some of them are even more, are quite masculine in their, in who they are because the woman that raised them taught them how to be a man.
