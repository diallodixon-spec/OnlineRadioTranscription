It's all right. You got me self-served. Thank you so much for keeping it locked and thank you for sending a message to the WhatsApp line, all right? Big up, big up, big up. All right, let's get back into the music. Gonna be giving you some R&B pop style right now. All right, before I do that, big up to Recorder. Got it locked in. Unstoppable Taxi Services crew.
