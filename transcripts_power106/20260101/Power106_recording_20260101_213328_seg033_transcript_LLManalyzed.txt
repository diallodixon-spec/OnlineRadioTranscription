20260101 213328 I know that love carries no She carries no guarantees But still I can't seem to find a reason that I can't believe in You said to be patient, I can give you some room You said you had changes, you need no room But the longer I wait, the farther I feel from you Now I'm lonely in love Why must I be lonely in love? I'm so lonely in love
