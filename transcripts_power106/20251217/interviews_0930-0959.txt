**Consumer Affairs Commission Warns Against Scams and Poor Quality Goods During Holiday Season**

In an exclusive interview on Radio Jamaica's "Talk With Substance" program, Latoya Halstead, Director of Communications at the Consumer Affairs Commission (CAC), urged consumers to be cautious when making purchases during the holiday season. With many Jamaicans still rebuilding after Hurricane Melissa, Halstead emphasized the importance of being alert and proactive to avoid falling prey to scams and unfair practices.

Halstead warned against home repair scams, where contractors may demand upfront payments, and advised consumers to pay in stages and obtain a written agreement. She also cautioned against social media deals that seem too good to be true, emphasizing the need to verify the seller's identity and ensure secure payment methods.

When purchasing devices and appliances, Halstead recommended doing research beforehand, checking sites like Consumer Reports and CNET for unbiased information. She also advised consumers to test devices in-store, if possible, and to take pictures of the barcode and ID number to ensure that the delivered product matches the one purchased.

Halstead highlighted the importance of obtaining a clear written warranty, which should state the conditions and refund policy. She noted that while the Consumer Protection Act implies a six-month warranty, consumers should aim to get a longer warranty, especially for large appliances.

The CAC Director also warned against common issues that can void warranties, such as misuse, unauthorized repairs, and incorrect voltage. She emphasized the need for consumers to choose wisely and ask questions about what the warranty covers and does not cover.

In conclusion, Halstead urged consumers to shop smart, do their research, and be aware of their rights under the Consumer Protection Act. She encouraged consumers to contact the CAC if they have any issues or concerns, and to report any suspicious or misleading advertisements on social media.

As the holiday season approaches, consumers are advised to be vigilant and take necessary precautions to avoid poor quality goods and services. By being informed and proactive, Jamaicans can protect their hard-earned money and ensure a safe and enjoyable holiday season.
