Minister with Responsibility for Works Robert Morgan. The hope is that this regulatory body will be the solution to long-standing issues related to maintenance, accountability and development. We have recognized over time that Jamaica has many roads, many types of roads, many standards by which roads are built. So imagine placing all roads in Jamaica under one regulatory framework, meaning all roads in Jamaica will be subjected to standards. So if it is a farm road it has to be subjected to this standard no matter which parish. If it's a municipal road it has to subjected to this standard, no matter which municipality. If it is a main road it cannot be one contractor in St. Thomas fixing the road with this standard, but another one in St. Mary fixing it in another standard. Streamlining, planning and maintenance.
