20251219 171009 Thanks for staying with us. You're listening to Roots 96.1 as serious failures in governance. Speaking on the state of the nation, Dr. Fontaine painted a grim picture of life in Dominica, pointing to rising violence, environmental degradation, and growing concerns about electoral integrity. He says these issues are combining to place increased pressure on citizens and undermine confidence in public institutions. The opposition leader also raised alarm about what he described as weak accountability and limited transparency in decision-making.
