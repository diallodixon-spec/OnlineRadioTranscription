20251218 155729 I'm saying to you, don't try going to an interview in 2025, 26 onwards and fail the interview because you can then be denied on the spot. What we've seen in the past is if you fail the interview, they issue a notice of intent to deny and you get an opportunity to respond to it and sometimes you're scheduled again for another interview and this is when you know you you get an attorney immediately and and you get into the preparation mode but I'm telling you that people who are denied are a lot of them are being taken into custody and then you are placed in deportation proceedings and you have to then renew your application for adjustment of status in front of a judge. It is a sad state of affairs Delia. Thank you so very much Miss Delia and looking forward to our next conversation with you and of course oh that is week after next
