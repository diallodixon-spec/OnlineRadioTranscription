20251215 162109 Hey, what do you say? Mr. C. I heard you out to Mr. Blacks. Got it locked in over there in New York City where he said too much ice. You need some heat, my brother. All right, just turn up the scorching radio station, Sun City. Just play it louder, see? And just draw the empress close by. And just rent a tile. Works every time, my bro. Who dat, Chris?? Chris became a self, got it locked in.
