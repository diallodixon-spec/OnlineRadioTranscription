20251230 190205 has played an active role in disaster relief after Hurricane Melissa, dispatching relief supplies, and mobilizing support for affected communities. The donation, which includes bassinets, baby scales, infusion pumps, and a pediatric larynx scope, is expected to strengthen the hospital's capacity to deliver safe, quality care to newborns and pediatric patients across Western Jamaica. Public Relations Officer for the Hummingbirds Association, Sharon Persa Cooper, says the donation is in the fact that there is devastation, dislocation, and some serious challenges to health care in Jamaica. And so we're donating here today to the pediatric department.
