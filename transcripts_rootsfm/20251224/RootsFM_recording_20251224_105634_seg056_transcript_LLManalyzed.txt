20251224 105634 Well, all I want for Christmas is to stay alive. Can't let the South of them have the 45. Well, all i want for Christmas is a new brand ride. With a thick Empress inside. Geez, no smoke, no fall, hunger, no liquor breeze. No one to stick up with gun and ball freeze. No brutal police to beat you till the week. Christmas can't catch me in a foreign country. Black lives matter in Jamaica too, we. All lives matter, same thing we pray. Could have come from Norbrook or T.G has stumbled and linked in the street. Freep out the party, you see it. Don't want no gun shot to bust in the street. Put down your gun, them please. And make we have a crime-free Christmas time. Don't let bloodshed rock with vibes.
