20251216 124023 about when you think about the flu vaccine. I don't see an issue with technique for that. Especially if you have a lot of people in an area who are being protected and have a boosted immunity, you can develop something called herd immunity. You risk not getting it. Even if you weren't vaccinated, it now becomes less just because everybody else is. Exactly. So you become more protected. Perfect. Well, thank you so much for talking with us today, Dr. Manier, about the cold and the flu. I'm sure our listeners were, you know, much better educated with regards to these two very common illnesses and especially what to do during this time. Any other last words, you know, for being healthy this season? Well hopefully not my last words. Not at all. Be safe, be healthy, eat well, don't overdo it.
