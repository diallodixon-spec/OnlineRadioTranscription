20251219 113424 I don't know about you, but I come here to fete Come to play a mask I'm not leaving until I wet Come to play a mass I don't live my life with regrets, no I come to jam on a bumper Come to drink out the liquor Until my head gone and I'm miserable All down on the ground, I'm causing trouble Look how the security watch me, they don't know I'm out there Had this much of big place and I defect like a jumby And to one way, they don't want me in their party day They don't want me cause I do one way They don't want me in their posse, they don't want me cause I chew on the way. They don't want in their posse. I ain't don't listen to nothing they say. Every time I draw, jumping up, doing what I want. Jumping up, telling them I ain't leaving, right there sleeping. Every time.
