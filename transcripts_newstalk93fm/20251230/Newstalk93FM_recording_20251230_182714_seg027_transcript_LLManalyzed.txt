20251230 182714 I just know I'm fine You take all the pressure off my mind All the time Patient and kind will not be going out my mind Say from the problems I don't worry cause I'm hard to find As I feel Safe like I just ran a slit across the plate Safe like we playing tag in your home base Safe like I got a big dog in the gate Safe like you one of these play in my face. Yeah, you know, I know you know that I'm that right. You got a girl that wanna get right. When I pass and I crash, you ain't gonna get right. That's when I need you the most. That's how I get right. Baby, if I'm safe in your arms, I feel safe. Safe like the money let it sit up in the bank. Safe like a cold deal arm I feel safe, nobody got right by my side so high I don't need a rich to somebody that can make me feel safe, yeah, look I don't want a couple but nobody ever made me feel safe
