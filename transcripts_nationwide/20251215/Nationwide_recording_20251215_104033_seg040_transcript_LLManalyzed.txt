20251215 104033 that incident in Australia yesterday. When a father and son decided to attack members of the Jewish community celebrating Hanukkah on a beach, Bondi Beach, famous beach in Australia. Helpless people going to the beach and you open fire on them with an assault or two assault rifles. You know, horrific, evil, vicious, deadly, and you know, for the people of that community in Australia and to the wider Australian community and the world. We have got to take serious account, honest account about the use of violence to resolve disputes. Yeah?
