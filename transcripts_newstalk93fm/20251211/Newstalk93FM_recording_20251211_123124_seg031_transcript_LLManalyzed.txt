============================================================

Waited so long to break these walls down To wake up and feel like me Put these patterns all in the past now And finally live like the girl they all see No more hiding, I'll be shining like I'm born to be Cause we are hunters, voices strong and I know I believe We're going up, up, up, it's our moment'm part of me Oh, our time, no fears, no lies
