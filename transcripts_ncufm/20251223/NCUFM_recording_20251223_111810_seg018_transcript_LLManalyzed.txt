20251223 111810 This Christmas, choose life. As we recover from Hurricane Melissa's devastation, we're reminded that life is fragile. Pedestrians, stay alert. Drivers, slow down. Rest if you're tired, And never drink and drive. One careless decision can change a family forever. Let's have a safe and prayerful Christmas and a crash free 2026. mail's here ma'am oh thank you I think I saw your son playing in the street oh okay well aren't you gonna tell him to stop playing in the street what restrict my little Bobby he has the freedom to do whatever he feels like doing but there are cars driving by big trucks
