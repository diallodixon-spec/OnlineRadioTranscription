Together we become stronger, wiser and more prepared for the journey ahead. As we go about the rest of our day and as we head into 2026, let's remember Proverbs 27 verse 17. As iron sharpens iron, so one person sharpens another. Let's walk today with gratitude for the people God has placed around us and with the commitment to be a sharpening presence in their lives. That's the promise we can hold on to. Growth through fellowship, strength through connection, and joy through community.
