20251218 145444 the time that you've been having selling because I noticed that lots and lots of people have stopped by here. I noticed because you have the card machine. It's a bunch of things, mainly your customer service, how you treat them, the prices you give them and I would say it's the interaction. And I noticed that you have been interacting quite well with the individuals on location. What kinds of prices do you have? You can give me some of the produce and some of the prices. You don't have to tell me everything. Starting with pineapples, they would be 250 per pound. Grape, that would be a thousand per pound. Apples are sold by dozen, so it would be a thousand for a dozen. And of course you have broccoli, you have sweet pepper, what else you have? You have pak choi, you have lettuce, you have carrots over there?
