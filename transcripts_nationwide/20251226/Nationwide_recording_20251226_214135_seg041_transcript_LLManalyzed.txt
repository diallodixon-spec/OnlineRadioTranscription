20251226 214135 I gotta follow it cause everything I know Well, it's love until I give it to you I can make a world a snowball I can make the fire a block And I can make every time good at the sound of the whistle I can make all the stadiums rock I can make the night forever Or I can make it disappear by the dawn And I can make you every promise that has ever been made And I can make all your demons be gone But I'm never gonna make it without you Do you really wanna see me grow?
