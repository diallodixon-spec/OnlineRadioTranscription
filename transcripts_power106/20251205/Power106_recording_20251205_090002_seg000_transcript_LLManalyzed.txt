some wishy-washy financial analysts and pay attention to the bigger picture. Well, I'm out of time. Thank you all so very much for your comments and your calls on this year agenda on a Friday morning. Let me thank my producers this morning, Jesse Blake, as well as Kareem Bradford, my technical operators this morning, Silly Spinock and Davin Thomas. I'm Kemoy Mac Ekron. Real Business is up next right here on Power 106 FM. Do have yourselves a great day and weekend. I'll be home for Christmas.
