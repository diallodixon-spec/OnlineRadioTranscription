Oh, oh, oh. And every time I shout, I say, I feel like lightning. Like lightning. Oh, oh. Don't want to be inside. Gonna be outside tonight. Do we have to tell them, oh, for sure, I'm having a good time. Blast my head real tight. I feel dynamite. Every time, every time, every time. Yeah. From the time I take a sip, I'm ready to go. Go, go, go, go. And from the time that I look ahead, I just need some more. More, more, more, more. It's a bottle and a spoon and a cup in my hand and I'm winding up on my man. Everybody's focus is jam, jam, jam. When we leave home, that is the plan. There's bumpers inside and numbers outside, so I hope all you don't know. When you crack the seal, that is the signal to go. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
