20251222 183720 I grew up in Westmoreland and working previously in the military, I was very much involved in monitoring how hurricanes, when they're coming in our direction, the likelihood come and so on. So I knew based on the intensity of the hurricane it was going to be devastating and that Westmoreland would be severely affected. And my sister is still living there. Predominantly the houses in the community where I grew up are board houses. So when the storm came and I spoke to her in the morning of the blow, I lost contact thereafter and I knew it was serious. So I decided that listen, it's going to be a Herculean effort, but I'm going to Westmoreland. Saturday morning my adaptive brother called me and said no, don't go, it's too dangerous.
