20260101 172621 still here. Dr Heather Fletcher, how you doing? Locked in enjoying the programs, welcome. Andrew Donaldson, blessings to you my brother, so you're still locked in. Laverne Palmer from Portmore is on with us because Tasha Lynn is saying happy new year to the Drive Damn family. Thank you Tasha Lynn. I'm grateful that the first day of 2026 is Take It Easy Thursday. It sets the perfect tone for the new year. Maranatha family, we're one year closer I'm fine, thank you, Karen. Happy New Year, Uncle Michael. Tenet families on the drive from Toronto. Wishing everyone a happy New Year.
