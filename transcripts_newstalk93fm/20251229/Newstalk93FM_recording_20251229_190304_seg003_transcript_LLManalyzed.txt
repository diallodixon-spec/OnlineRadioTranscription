I'm not afraid of the ocean. I keep you warm and cozy. You'll be coming on me arms when the storms approaching. So why funny? When all of us think like the titanic, the lighthouse, we are where I just love me Deep as the blue sea, deep as the blue sea Love me really and truly And even though the storms will come, no we won't run, just love me Wherever the wind may carry us, I will never let you go. I have one thing I have to say to you.
