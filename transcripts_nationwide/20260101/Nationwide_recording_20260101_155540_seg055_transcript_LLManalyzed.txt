20260101 155540 Even loving you No way Because I was born to love you You were born to love me too And I can't deny it Baby I love you more each minute When you're not around I'm so empty All I need is you beside me There ain't no substitute For your company When my night is dark You shine your light and I see clearly Nothing can divide us, except the rain Nothing can divide us Every day I love her just a little bit more Little bit more, little bit more And she loves me the same
