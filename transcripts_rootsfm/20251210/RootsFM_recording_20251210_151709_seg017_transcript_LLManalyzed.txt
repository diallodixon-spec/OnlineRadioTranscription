Oh Somebody's gonna hurt you The way you love to keep hurting me We're saying oh, oh Sheila Let me love you till the morning comes Say sorry, oh, oh Sheila You know I want to be the only one Oh, baby Understand that I want to be the only man. But it seems almost like I'm too hard, and I think I'll start to have my own fun. Oh, baby, it's plain to see that I'm the only one.
