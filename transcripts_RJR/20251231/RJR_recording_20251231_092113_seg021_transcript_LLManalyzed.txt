20251231 092113 does not leave home that is happy. And if they do, it's in a very small minority of children who leave a happy home. So I am expecting next year that our agency that we release things will make sure that they get into the social services, the police are more involved to find where these children live in the first place and then remedy the situation I take a point John, in fact While I do note that when the JCF Posts that missing persons if they do return they will post socially to say yes, they have returned. But you're right. Are the agencies themselves checking to see what are the underlying factors to say what would have caused a child to go missing in the first instance? Is there support that is required?
