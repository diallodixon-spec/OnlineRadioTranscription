============================================================

You make me wanna run, run, run Heart be racing like a drum, drum, drum Don't know where we'll go, don't know Where we'll go, yeah We don't need to run away Just stay right next to me Stay right next to me, stay right next to me But if you wanna go, we up all night If you wanna go, I'll let you go But if you want to go, I will let you go
