20251218 110403 from october so we have a responsibility to remind you of your safety i have seen an increase in persons coming up boat um persons pretending to be landlords and renting them places online and they are so desperate that they were transferring money to them and there's no house there's nothing they don't see anything they see pictures. So then after they pay the money, the site gone. Or they stop responding. They are doing vehicles. I have a gentleman I need to take to Sea Talk as we speak because it happens to him. He texted me this morning because he paid over 400,000 online for a vehicle and the vehicle don't exist. When he go to the location where the vehicle showed to him and everything there is a place there but there's nobody there by that name and so forth. So there's other things that is happening within this holiday season
