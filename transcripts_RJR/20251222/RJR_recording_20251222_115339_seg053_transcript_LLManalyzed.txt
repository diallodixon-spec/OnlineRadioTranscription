We contribute to education, we contribute to sports, we contribute to community development, and this is something that we do all the time. During COVID, we were able to assist, and wherever the need is, and not just for our members, Glenn, not just for members, but overall for our people because we believe in helping people. That's what we do every single day. This year alone we donated over $30 million through scholarships and grants. Over $30 million collectively as a movement. So we live by these principles and number seven for us is very big. Absolutely. Well, you know, I know that the credit union is international and this is also aligning with the United Nations year cooperatives. Yes, it's true.
