It's okay because I'm here. So for the persons who are going through or have gone through something similar, just talk as persons are actually out there willing to help, willing to give a hand, but they won't know that you need them unless you say something. That's a tough childhood to have and to go through all of that trauma and it makes me wonder. There had to be some resilience in you and it makes me one that if that was preparing you, it sounds weird for what else was was to come because what else to come was even more difficult. So talk to me about the medical issues. It's just in the interest of time, I'm leaping and bounding.
