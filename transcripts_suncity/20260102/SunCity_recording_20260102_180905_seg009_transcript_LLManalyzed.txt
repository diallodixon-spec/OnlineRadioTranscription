20260102 180905 Every month I found a girl my parents love She'll come and stay the night and I think I might have it all For the girl he sent my way, but I know the things he gives, he can take away And I hold you every night That's a feeling I wanna get used to But there's no man as terrified As the man who stands to lose you Oh, I hope I don't lose you. Please stay. I want you. I need you. Oh, God, don't take me away.
