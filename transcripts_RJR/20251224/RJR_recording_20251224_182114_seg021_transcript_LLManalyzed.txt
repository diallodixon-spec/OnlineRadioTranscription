20251224 182114 Waiting for one child Black, white, yellow No one knows But a child that will make you grow up And turn tears to laughter Hate to love World of peace to everyone To everyone's neighbor And misery and suffering Will be the words to be forgotten It's all a dream And illusions now It must come true sometime soon somehow All across the land dawns a brand new morn This comes to pass when a child is born. And there you put flickers in the sky. Tiny stars in the sky.
