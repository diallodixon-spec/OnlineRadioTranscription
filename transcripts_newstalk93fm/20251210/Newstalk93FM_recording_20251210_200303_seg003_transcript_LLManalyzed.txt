can we talk some business you know i want your company and it's nothing too risky limited liability don't worry if you try all the things i like you could still be shy in the morning so don't feel away You don't like the fast life When you come on the bright side I go take the blame I just want you to come and light it up Just a little whine then I'll say Come and meet me at the end of the truck And we wrap it up Say cool day Keep throwin' it back I don't know why you stopped us baby no way we got most of all the pictures you want when you're ready i could overshare darling you could overshare what we could eat in the middle and start a bacchanal play in the middle hey what we gonna do
