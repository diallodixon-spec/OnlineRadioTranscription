20251218 183021 before I decide to go home. Act like you heard me, only serve it up if you deserve me, yeah. Girl, my love is worth it. Press it up, y'all. Push the stars. Push up, push up. Act like you hear me. Only serve it up, if you deserve me. Yeah. Shake it up like a earthquake. Press it up y'all, push the stars. Gonna bang, bang bang. Pushin' on my buttons, do no hesitation. Gas me up, give me motivation. Tell me where we come, pick a destination. Gas me up. Give me motivation now. Pushin' my buttons, do not hesitate. Gas me up! Give me motivation. Show me where we come. Pick a destination. Right, that's up. Be a girl, you're the baddest, to be honest. But this girl from the planet, and it's just your honest work. That's my word, if you made fun of it. No fret on it, cause I'm gonna make you fly just like birds. I make you wiggle with the thing, I make you jiggle with the thing. Move up your body and I swing, I am the king for your world.
