20251231 161310 it's not enough to satisfy emotions that are shared between us I want to love as cozy, but I need so much more It just intensifies my wants to have the love that endures Because every time I close my eyes, I think of you And no matter what the season is, I still love you. Ooh, it's from my heart. And I want to be wherever you are. I can't help but think of you.
