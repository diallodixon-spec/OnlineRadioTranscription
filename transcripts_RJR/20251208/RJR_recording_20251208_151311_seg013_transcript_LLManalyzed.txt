============================================================

We're giving the best of time to rest just let the blessings flow So when life puts us through the test we'll find more room to grow Just like the sunset in the west, the energy aglow Extending all tradition and love and let it overflow Above the horizon, shout it out, we're not gonna stay below Love is the ultimate in life in case you never know Sound it like a rock that mean them just can't come over town cause that's the way it's haffi go Keep it moving, freedom in our unanimous Keep him proving, that he's about to skip on earth and rain Keep it moving, keep on moving
