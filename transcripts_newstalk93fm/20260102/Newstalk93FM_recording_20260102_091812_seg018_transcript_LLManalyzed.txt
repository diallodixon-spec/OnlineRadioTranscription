20260102 091812 I hope you're good, I hope you're well, I hope you live. I miss your touch, I miss your smell, I miss your little lips. Maybe grab a drink, maybe grab some food, don't miss you. I know it's hard, but don't, don't have the glass. I had to protect my heart, and built the wall so tall, I couldn't look over. I need to touch you One more time, one more time I'll take you one by five, not on the wireless And though you said not to call you again when I miss you And I hope I can see you one more day when I miss you Baby, baby, baby, baby
