Now, in asking questions in Japanese, you know how we have that question mark, and we'll probably say it in a higher pitch to make it a question. In Japanese, we actually have this ka particle. So Karakimasha means to be from somewhere. To ask somebody where they're from, we would say Karakimashitaka. That's right. Okay, I learned a little something there. A little bit of anime paying off every now and again. So then in that case, how would you say I am a student in Japanese? All right so remembering that Watashiwa is the I am. Now student is Gakusei and the sentence marking participle is this you know that full stop in English so we would say Watashiwa Gakusei this.
