20251229 162515 I can't say what life will show me But I know what I've seen I can't say where life will lead me But I know where I'll be Tried my hand at loving friendship But all that is passed and gone This little ball is moving on. Sitting here in limbo, waiting for the tide to blow. Sitting here, in limbo, knowing that I have to go. Well, they're putting up resistance, but I know that my faith will live on.
