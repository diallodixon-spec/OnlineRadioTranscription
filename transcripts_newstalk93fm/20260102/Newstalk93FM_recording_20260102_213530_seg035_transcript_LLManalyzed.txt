20260102 213530 I'm a big dog, baby, and a dog, baby Stuff me, yeah, you and I'm crazy Face like crazy, man, don't chase me Say you won't see me, well, you're in for me Chanel. Say you love me. For me Chanel. Walking, standing tall, but still fall for me. You'll come in with baggage it's costing me. Still don't have it all, but give it all to me. Come and turn me on, we'll go all for me.
