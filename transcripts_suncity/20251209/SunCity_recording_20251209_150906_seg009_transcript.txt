============================================================

Jamaica, we shall rise. Rise. We shall rise. Why did you drop from your rise? Why do you still? Jamaica, we shall raise. Rise. pain, the children are hurting. Blood runs through them veins. Leaders make we unite and we build this again. Yes, we are one, out of many people. And when we're so good, we always triumph over evil. We are going to rise and soar like a eagle.
