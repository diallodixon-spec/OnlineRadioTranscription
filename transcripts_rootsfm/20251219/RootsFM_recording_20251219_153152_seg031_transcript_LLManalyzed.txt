20251219 153152 Now you have me wondering, what have you done to me? You have me inside exotic. I know I'm wondering if I'm lovesick. Is this real or is it a myth? I know I'm not going crazy. You're wandering, you're losing your mind. But if I'm not losing it, why am I feeling this? Maybe it's a sign you should be there for me. Baby, I'm dreaming of you and me lately. Baby, where are you? I hope you're feeling lonely. I can't see without you. I can't breathe without you. So I stick it to my neck, just like a melody did it with a riff. You told me really why we love to stick, like a glove or something.
