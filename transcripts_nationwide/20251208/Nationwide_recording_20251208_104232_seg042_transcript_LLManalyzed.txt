elected Member of Parliament for Westmoreland East, Dr. Dayton Campbell is to step back from his substantive day-to-day duties as General Secretary of the PNP. It's understood that at a meeting of the PNPs National Executive Council yesterday, a decision was made that Dr. Campbell be allowed some time away from the day-to-day leadership of the Secretariat so he can focus on helping his constituents rebound from the devastation caused by Melissa. It's understood that the NEC meeting, given the shift in Dr. Campbell's focus, they are creating a new post, National Projects Director.
