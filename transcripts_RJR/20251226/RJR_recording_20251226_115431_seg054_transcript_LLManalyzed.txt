20251226 115431 Montell Jordan This is how we do it It's Friday night and I feel alright The party's here on the west side So I reach for my 40 and I turn it up Designated driver, take the keys to my truck Hit the shop cause I'm faded Honey's in the streets, same money, yo we made it It feels so good in my hood tonight The summertime skirts and the guys Kanai. All the gang bangers forgot about the drive-by. You gotta get your groove on before you go get paid. So tip up your cup and throw your hands up and let me hear the party say, I'm kind of buzzed.
