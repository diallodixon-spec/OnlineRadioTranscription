============================================================

world where people care. Someday at Christmas there'll be no tears, when all men are equal and no man has missed. One sunny moment, one proud way from our world today. Someday all our dreams will come to be. But Some day at Christmas, a man will not fail. Hate would be gone, and love will prevail. Some day a new world that we can start with hope in every heart.
