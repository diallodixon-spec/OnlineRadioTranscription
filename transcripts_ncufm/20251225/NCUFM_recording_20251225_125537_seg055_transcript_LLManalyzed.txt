20251225 125537 As we're about to bring this ship into the dock, I have just a few more greetings I can't end the show without sending. Sending greetings to the staff of the Iwerton Primary School. Coming from Rhone, aka G Breezy. Auntie Maxine, I do hope you enjoy the rest of your day. Thank you for always cruising.
