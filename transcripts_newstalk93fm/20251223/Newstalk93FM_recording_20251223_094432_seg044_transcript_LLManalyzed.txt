20251223 094432 I have a lightning jumbie, a kind of energy inside me And it ready for the rum, ready, ready for the rum Ready, ready, for the rum Ready for the action, a spiritual encounter In me soul taking over Telling me to start up the drinking And do away with good behaviour So let we go, let we go down the road Let we go, it's action time, let we go It's bac back-and-on time, there we go. Hands up. This sweating spirit of me feeling good. I'll see you in the next one.
