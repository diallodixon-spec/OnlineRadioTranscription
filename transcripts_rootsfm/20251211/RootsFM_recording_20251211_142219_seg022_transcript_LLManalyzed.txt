2025-12-11 18:26:17 I'll take her later When she was gone, then lonely I feel it I know that this life can't be real As though she's like a magnet and I understand it For your love, I do appeal it You're coming back, coming back And I know That I gonna love her better than before I thought I could stand by me, but she wasn't listening. She followed her friend and company and overrun with pain. I know she's gone and now my life is in the misery. Oh, baby girl, come and be the pinnacle. Ah, ah, ah, ah.
