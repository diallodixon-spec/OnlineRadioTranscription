20251219 171007 Once there was a king that thought he got it right Daniel wouldn't last until the morning light They led him to the dungeon and they threw him in He was on his way to supper and the meal was him But God knew how to change their dinner plans Never throw a hungry line in the bin with a praying man So pray Daniel, pray That's the way and make it through Come on pray Daniel, pray Don't you let the devil get the best of you Your troubles aren't as bad as you thought they were. You can tame a lion, let your prayer be heard. Your faith is gonna have them eaten right out of your hands. Never throw a rock or a line in the dead with a brave man.
