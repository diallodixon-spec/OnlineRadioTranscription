20260101 205537 I'm gonna keep it free, you like the foundation with the semen, gonna block me of this fear. Baby girl, here's the deal. You're sensitive like a little person on the list. First, when you put on the hook, you wanna put on the list. I love to see you on the street, now when I touch you, yes. You get me high, high, high, like when I put you, yes. Cause I promise, to be honest, with you in all my life, I feel a warmness. And it's warmness. The chemistry is automatic. You can work it off like a mathematician. And I promise, to me honest, with you and all my life, I'm feeling a total warmness, and it's cold, I'll keep you warm. You and I, and it's the fall of love.
