20251229 132614 I knew our love was meant to be But now you wanna turn your back on me It seems to me Your love is fading away From me you're running father and father every day And I wanna know now Why are you going away? Why you wanna break my heart? We made the vow on our wedding day From the people of the town I heard you say Now and forever, we always stay But now for me, you're going away I wanna know, why are you going away? Why do you wanna break my heart?
