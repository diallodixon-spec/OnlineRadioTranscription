20251224 111309 We are now at the end of our drive. We hope you enjoyed this drive. If you did, stage door, packed in with the autograph hounds, barking her name, then glowing like the end of a cigarette while she came out. I said, you live in my dream. Then she said to me, hey, thank you for the lovely bouquet. You're sweeter than a peach, but you don't know the life of it so, girl, babe. And you're never, ever gonna wait. The more you play, the more that you pay. You're softer than a kitten, so you don't know life of it so.
