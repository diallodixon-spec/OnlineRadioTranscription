**National Housing Trust Initiatives to Support Jamaicans Affected by Hurricane Melissa**

In an effort to support Jamaicans affected by Hurricane Melissa, the National Housing Trust (NHT) has introduced a range of initiatives to help individuals rebuild and recover. Assistant General Manager of Corporate Communications and Public Affairs at the NHT, Duane Burbick, recently discussed these initiatives with Adrian Atkinson, host of GIS TV's Get the Facts program.

According to Burbick, the NHT has a team of social workers who are assessing the impact of the hurricane on contributors and providing relief support directly to them. The NHT is also offering a hurricane relief loan, which can be used to repair damaged properties. Burbick explained that the loan is disbursed in tranches, with the first tranche covering initial repairs and subsequent tranches released upon completion of the work.

In addition to the loan, the NHT is offering a disaster grant of up to $500,000 to contributors who have been affected by the hurricane. The grant is not restricted to homeowners and can be used to repair any property that has been damaged by the hurricane. Burbick noted that the NHT is prioritizing need, with those who have been worst affected by the hurricane being given priority.

The NHT is also offering a moratorium on mortgage payments for individuals who have been affected by the hurricane. Burbick explained that this moratorium is available to all NHT mortgage holders and can be applied for through the NHT's website.

With Christmas just around the corner, many Jamaicans who have been affected by Hurricane Melissa may be struggling to find hope and happiness during the holiday season. Psychotherapist Adélie Fraser recently shared some strategies for managing mental health during this difficult time.

Fraser suggested that individuals take a moment to acknowledge their feelings, whether it be sadness, anxiety, or anger. She also encouraged individuals to practice gratitude, focusing on the things that they are thankful for, rather than dwelling on what they have lost.

She encouraged individuals to reach out to family and friends, and to seek help if they are struggling to cope with their emotions.
