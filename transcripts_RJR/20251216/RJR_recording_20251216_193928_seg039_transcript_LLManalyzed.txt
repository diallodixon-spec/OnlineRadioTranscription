20251216 193928 Alright people, now the last thing I want to talk about quickly is a scam that the police are advising the people to be aware of. And it's particularly bad because it's targeting people down in the West who are searching for accommodations after their residences were destroyed during Melissa. So criminals are posting on social media that a house in a particular area is for rent and there might be several persons on the waiting list so you need to hurry and transfer $50,000 to hold the space or to hold for viewing. And after you do that, then you can't reach them no more. We all have to be careful. Time's rough right now, so if it means you have to make an opportunity to miss you, so you don't lose your hard-earned money, you have to just make that one the pass.
