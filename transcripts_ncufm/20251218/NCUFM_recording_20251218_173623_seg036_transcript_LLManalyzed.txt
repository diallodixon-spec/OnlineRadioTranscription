20251218 173623 God gave him a name above all others A name full of power, worthy of honor A name exalted high above the heavens A name full of reverence Holy and blessed And at the name of Jesus Every tongue shall sing his praise Crying holy, holy, holy To the Lamb for sinners slain. Every knee shall bow and every tongue confess Jesus is Lord of all, all to the glory of God.
