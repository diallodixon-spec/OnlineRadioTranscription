20260101 103136 You wake up in the morning started on my knees Thanking my father for shielding me Though my burdens are heavy My trials are great but I have a Savior so I live by faith so I'm still here, I'm still here though the devil tried to kill me I'm still here I'm gonna have me in his arms Protect me with his hands That's why I am still here
