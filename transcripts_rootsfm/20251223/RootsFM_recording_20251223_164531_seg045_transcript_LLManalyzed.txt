When I look in your eyes, baby, I see clear as a morning sun. I got to take some more time off and give you extra fun. And I know you like it. I hope we never get tired. And I never let you go to work. No one knocking on the door. This has been a no disturb sign. No baby crying. And no heart blowing.
