20251217 174428 It does not mean that you are for it. It just means that there is no law in place. I think that's a very, that's a very technical distinction. No, surely it is not at all. So for instance, you might not think that, I don't know, you might, hold on, you might hold on. No, no, let me just finish it out. You may not, for instance, think that being mean to somebody is nice or should be done and that we should teach our children not to be mean but that doesn't mean that being mean should be a criminal offense. It's not at all a technicality. It's simply saying that it's something you think is wrong should not happen but that the criminal law shouldn't be the process that you engage there. Can I ask you to hold on? Let me take a break, do a little bit of business. We'll come back and I know you want to respond and I want to bring back Kimberly on that point.
