From Marcia in Islington said Mary. Thank you. Dr. T. Enjoy the rest of your day Marcia. Love you. All right Okay The mayor dr. Taylor the mayor in Spanish Town is sleeping and somebody else said dr. Taylor the MS NSW MA is messing up the Spanish town and the municipal authority sleeps on the timely garbage collection that is lacking. Next, our laws should ensure that MPs and other political representatives reside in their respective constituencies so that proper and pertinent representation can be had. The roads too are in the most deplorable state ever. Dr. T, I'm so fed up you wouldn't even begin to fathom regards.
