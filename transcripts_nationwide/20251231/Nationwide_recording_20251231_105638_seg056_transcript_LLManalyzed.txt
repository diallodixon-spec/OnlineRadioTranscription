20251231 105638 I am understanding that there are, there's a group in Portland, not their land, not the ruler of the land, but there are other groups that have come together and filed that before the court. So what is it that they're asking for? Do you know? The group is asking for full access along a roadway, I'm told. But there is nothing blocking the access from the roadway. People can access the roadway. However, it is a narrow passage, Mr. Hughes, and vehicles cannot park along that corridor. What we know of, and this has been allowed for persons who aren't able to enter from the roadway at the top where there's a small pedestrian gate, right? It was not allowed to drive down to the beach where the persons cannot enter.
