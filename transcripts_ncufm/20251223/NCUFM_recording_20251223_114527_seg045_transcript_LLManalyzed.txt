20251223 114527 It's a beautiful day If you got life, then give God praise You may not have money, but you're living day by day You can't have faith, and don't want to work. It's a beautiful day, it's a beautiful day It may not be the way I want it to be But I thank you for every situation That made me good and bad friends That came into my life and those who are still here
