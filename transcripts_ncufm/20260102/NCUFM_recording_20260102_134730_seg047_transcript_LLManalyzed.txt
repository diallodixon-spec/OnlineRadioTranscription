20260102 134730 While you wait for the Lord to come, make sure your salvation is secure in Jesus Christ. Don't be afraid. Fear causes torment. And God does not want you to be in torment, to live in torment. And there are many young people all over the world. A research was done among 10,000 young people in 10 countries and the research shows that young people are frightened, afraid of the future, of what is coming. They feel absolutely hopeless, they feel that their government has not treated them well, the governments have failed them, and there is nowhere to turn to. They don't know where to look for hope. These young people need to hear the gospel of Jesus Christ, for there is hope in the Lord.
