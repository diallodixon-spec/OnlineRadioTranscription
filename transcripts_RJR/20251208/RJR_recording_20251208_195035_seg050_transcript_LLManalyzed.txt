to assist Jamaica with its post-Hurricane recovery efforts. Community groups and diaspora leaders are hosting fundraisers, concerts and volunteer drives.

In addition to individuals, organizations and registered charities are also reaching out to support the Hurricane Melissa recovery efforts. We've seen outreach from so many persons who are so concerned about what has taken place in Jamaica and are jumping on board to see how they can also be a part of helping to come to a resolution, helping the people who are facing the devastation and the catastrophe in Jamaica. The Office of the High Commissioner of Jamaica to Canada has been sharing information and coordinating relief efforts in the community. This coordination involves organizing the shipment of items that are donated by members of the diaspora.
