20251215 130911 We don't want no batter that I need a little breather. Two days on the road with some jam in the middle. Divey come, we need to find the middle. For the sake of peace of mind, so the middle of the road is clear. You'll find me and my friend and them because we move so hard, so hard For a week, we deserve a party We deserve it, we deserve it Say we deserve it, yeah we deserve it Tell your friend and them, tell all the girl and them Bring all your friend and them and let's get it started. I say, I say, boy, yo, yo, yo. Oh, so come on, let's make a jump. And then we started by the jump, by the jump. Then we started by the joke. Party on the road. There's a party on the road. Light it up, light it up. Bring the shots and light it up. Party on the roads. There's a body on the road. Look at light.
