20251215 162009 Look at myself, check it in. Look at myself in general. To every needed child If anyone should ask you who's my true love Tell them my love's true It's evident in all the love come true Let my love shine throughout the world To every mountain, town, and steppe. Let it be felt by every soul. In love. Oh, no. Love song.
