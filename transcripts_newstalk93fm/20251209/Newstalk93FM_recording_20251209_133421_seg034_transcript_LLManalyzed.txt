============================================================

I miss you. And I hope I can see you one more day. I miss you're good, I hope you're well, I hope you live I'll make you touch, I'll make you smell I'll make you lose You can grab a drink, maybe grab some food, don't be ashamed I know it's hard, but no, I don't have to cry I had to protect my heart, and build the know so little. I don't have the glass. I had to protect my heart. I'm built to watch so tall. I couldn't look over. I need to touch you. One more time. I'll take you one by five. And I don't know why. I couldn't go anywhere.
