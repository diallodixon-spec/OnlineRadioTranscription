20251222 131412 I ain't gonna be a special night Or a minute more to come And I'm so proud to be with you So proud, so proud, so proud Looking back over my years I guess I shared it some days I told myself time and time again This time I'm gonna win For another fight, things ain't right, I'm losing again Takes a fool to lose twice, I'm all over the place Think I better let it go Hey! Hey! Nationwide, my TSM.
