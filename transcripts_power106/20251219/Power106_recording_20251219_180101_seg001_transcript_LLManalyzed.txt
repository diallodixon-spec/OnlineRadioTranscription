There will never be enough. Chasing after pleasure may gratify for a time, but it really doesn't satisfy. And here is the reason. We all have a God-shaped vacuum inside us that can never be satisfied by the things of this world. A relationship with Jesus Christ is the only thing that will fill that deep-seated need within us. So how do you begin that relationship? You must receive God's free gift of salvation by placing your faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. That means you understand that you are a sinner and that the penalty for sin is death. But God sent his son Jesus Christ.
