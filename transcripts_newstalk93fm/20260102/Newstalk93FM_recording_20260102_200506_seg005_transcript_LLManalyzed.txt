20260102 200506 My vote hands up to the sky, I testify Tonight men are gonna go back home to me bed On the left, on the right, there's so much critical On to the carnival, with a bag of green on me It's so critical Send for the bad guys Cause this ring's on the wrong way And we havin' a good time Yes, we havin a good time Just take the shot one time Come and enjoy the life When last you've been to a party Plenty women looking so nice We must be in paradise When last you had a time to remember His olive and butter fender And the drinks got gone, they got the bartender Who come with the money, come with the honey Who come to dance and then go lay? I come with a cooler, milk a bit loud, yeah, we come to vibes and elevate. No, it's not a mistake. When the girls see we, they just wanna participate. J, bring down the soaker, bust up the speaker, cause it take the stress away.
