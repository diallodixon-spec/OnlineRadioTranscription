20251225 212217 For a spell of doom no one's seen for long This comes to pass when a child is born And all this happened because the world is waiting Waiting for a child Black, white, yellow, who knows But a child who will grow up and turn tears to laughter Hate to love, war to peace and everyone to everyone's neighbor And misery and suffering will be a word to be forgotten forever It's all a dream and illusion now It must come true sometime soon somehow All across the land dawn a brand new morn This comes to pass
