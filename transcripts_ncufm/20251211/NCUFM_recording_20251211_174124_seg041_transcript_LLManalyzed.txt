2025-12-12 10:35:15 I've been the preacher on this Vespa service more than one time. I remember Tishelle Coley, my previous captain. She has spoken on the platform. Joni did sing on the platform. Tishelle is going to be back on the platform tomorrow evening. She's going to be one of the guest singers. And the keynote speaker will be your cruise captain, Tiffany Johnson. So if you wanna be on that Vespa series, just text me right now and say Vespa. I have the flyer and I have the link. I can send it right now. And tomorrow evening, all of we can gather up and watch it together. It will be about 7.30 Jamaica time tomorrow evening. Just text me and say Vespas. Let me send it to you, all right? If you want to be on.
