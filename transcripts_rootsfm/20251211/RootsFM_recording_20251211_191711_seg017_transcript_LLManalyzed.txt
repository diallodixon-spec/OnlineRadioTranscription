2025-12-12 05:29:34 Hey, you know what paradise is? It's a lie. A fantasy we create about people and places as we'd like them to be. But you know what truth is? It's that little baby you're holding. And it's that man you fought with this morning. The same one you're going to make love with tonight. That's truth, that's not Sometimes I've been to crying for unborn children That might have made me complete But I, I took the sweet life I never knew I'd be bitter from the sweet I spent my life exploring The subtle whoring that cost too much to be free They may have been to paradise But have never been to me
