20251222 163616 How are we all doing? I'm doing good. I'm very grateful. Lots to be thankful for this year. Lots to be. Family is our theme this year. And that's why we kind of moved away from our usual buzzers on Christmas days. And we're doing buzzers this Christmas because we feel like that term just embodies what we're trying to do this year. Everything that we're doing is about the family, you know, bringing out the family and have the family enjoying themselves. And so as per usual, what we're doing is or a super deal. Yes. So we have two packages. It's a general plus, which is $3,500 or it's the toddlers super deal, which is the same $3,500. So one caters to all age groups and the other one is for the babies okay right so what is included for the toddlers is the ball pit which is an interactive ball pit only one on the island or bumper zone and or jungle gym all of those as I said you know are one of a kind
