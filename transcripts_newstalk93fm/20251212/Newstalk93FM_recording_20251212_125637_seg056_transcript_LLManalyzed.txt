20251212 125637 So we do it Who you remember? Every word your eyes spoke to me The sweetest surrender Thought that I would grow so weary But love gets better Now my girlfriends, they see it too The glow on my face is because of you You are, you are You're my piece of mind, mind, mind nice, so nice, so nice Never catch a vibe that feels so right When you're not around I close my eyes and fantasize Thought he was sweet So sweet, so sweet, so sweet
