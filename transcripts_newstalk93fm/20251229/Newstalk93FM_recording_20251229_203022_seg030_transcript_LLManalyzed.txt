20251229 203022 You ain't gotta go nowhere, you can stay inside it Can you blow my mind? Set it off my whole body If I give you my time Can you search my soul from it? I don't wanna wait, come take it Take me where I ain't been before Can you lose my breathe, make me water. Make me sweat. Make me harder. Make me lose my breath.
