20260101 192423 I like new beginnings, hopes and no fears. No fears, no hope. I have to tell you, tell it, tell it my way. I like happy endings, there are no changes. No, no, no more no. The sun's gonna shine All over town I'd like to begin a song Well, my love, it's been a while since we were together
