So I taught them about cantaloupes and honeydew and then watermelon and pineapple and mango and bananas and auto-eaty apple or every Tuesday we pick a different fruit and we just learn about the fruit and I show them videos on YouTube and then we make like food smoothies and them kind of thing or food popsicles and if you don't know how to make a food popsicle here's what you do just blend Just blend out the fruits, right? Use a regular ice tray, right? Put it in the freezer, and when it starts to get a little slushy, you pop in a fruit stick into it, and just let it remain. Once it's fully frozen, pop it out, and there you go. Fruit Tuesday. So give it a try. You can thank me later. I still maintain that cantaloupe is something where when you like you go to a hotel and they give you a fruit like a fruit salad and you just eat round it. Cantaloupe is one of the best. So when you grow up poor you don't have to resort. You learn to appreciate.
