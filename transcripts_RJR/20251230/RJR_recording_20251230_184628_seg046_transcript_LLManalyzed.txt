But I think we should have clinched it in the last year. You know how a foward must be selfish, but sometimes you have to know when to be selfish. Just play with your partner and get the go-ahead. But definitely it wasn't to be, but I think it was a from a game like this, as I said, was end-to-end. A lot of chances at both end to collaborate a point is something that we are very grateful for. We should have controlled and managed the game after that period of time. The game was end to end, a pretty open game also. And I think it was just a little lapse in concentration that we gave up that goal.
