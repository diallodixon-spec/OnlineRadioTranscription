That's where I'm going to swim. I think you're going to get a 9 to a 20. 9 to a 21. 9, but I can't believe it. Please watch my next video. I'm on my last month of Christmas. You're gonna see that. It's true. I've got more than I can't see. I've got a lot less than I should have. I mean, I've seen this before. This is private. I only do that 37% percent of the time. I don't miss it. But I can't believe I missed a little bit. It's crazy. I just need to make sure I don't miss a thing. I'm trying to see if this makes sense. It's not. I'm doing my thing. It's more than I can think of. I'm just doing it. I'm doing it. I am having fun. I'm having a great time. I'm having fun. I am having a good time.
