20260102 172223 So it seems that Jamaica is highly protected at this time by the Almighty, because as the system will move toward us, then we expect that it will move around us rather than moving directly over. By Saturday, October 25, Melissa was strengthening and headed for Jamaica. So it's expected to move toward the west, and when it is south of Jamaica, south of Clarendon in particular, it's expected to start moving toward the north. At that time, all this time, it is expected to be a major hurricane, because what we're expecting after today is that there will be rapid intensification of this system. By October 27, Melissa was a category five hurricane. What we have facing us is a major category five hurricane that is over the waters of the Caribbean Sea and moving closer and closer to the mainland of Jamaica. It is moving now to the northwest which would suggest that it's going to be moving away.
