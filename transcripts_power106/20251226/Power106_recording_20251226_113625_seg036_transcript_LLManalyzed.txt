Ain't no woman like the one I love. What a good, good thing I've got. She means, she means a lot. Ain't no women like the one I've got, no No, they don't come back, no To make her happy doesn't take a lot She don't ask for things, it don't matter So together, like a hand in love They're just in a letter Ain't no momma like the one I love
