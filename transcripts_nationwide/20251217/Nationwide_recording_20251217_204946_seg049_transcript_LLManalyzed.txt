20251217 204946 And I've seen some people would say some things on social media, may I fear I wonder, if them nothing could them bring. So they were on the TikTok match and it was a banter. I'm not familiar with this content nor the other person who was on the live. But it was a bunch that was happening and they were both threatening each other to an extent, right? But it's just so eerie that right as the other person, I'm assuming innocently, making these threats to his life, not even a minute after he got killed, on the same life. Not even a minute after he got killed. On the same life. Yo, when I see things like them, that's why I tell you, brother, you see me, I don't want nobody to joke with me. I don't want, you know, like my friends know certain things I don't joke about. It's what comes on to my life, bro.
