Why don't you say the things that you said to me yesterday? I know you said that I am a so many things. Something's going down, that's the way it seems. Shouldn't be no reason why you act so strange. Nobody's holding you back from me. Because I know how you used to do. When you're saying everything to me, it comes true. Why can't you just tell the truth? If somebody's there, then tell me who. Say my name, say my name. Say my name, say my name No one is around you Say, baby, I love you You ain't running gay Say, my name, say, my name You're a wacky kind of shady Ain't calling me baby By the sudden change Say, my name Say, my name Yeah, no one is around you, say, baby I love you, you ain't running gay Tell the truth, will you win?
