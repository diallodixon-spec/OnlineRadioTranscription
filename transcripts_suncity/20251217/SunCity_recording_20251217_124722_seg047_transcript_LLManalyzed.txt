20251217 124722 Only moment today Just don't wanna be lonely Rather be loved, be there Depended on to give a love I can't give When you're gone, when you're gone Just don't want to be lonely I don't mind when the time sets the sun to the moon. Just don't wanna be lonely. Let the stairs find you there at the end of the room, I just don't want to be alone.
