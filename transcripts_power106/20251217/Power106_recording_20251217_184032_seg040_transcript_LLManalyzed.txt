20251217 184032 What age group are you talking about here? Go again. What age group are we talking about? Okay, well we're targeting age group between 9 to 17. Okay, yes. But there were co-op players already good enough for these tournaments and tours you're talking about? Yes. So we will be having those players on Saturday also. But as you know, with the nine, 10, 12, we basically need new talent for those because those students would have graduated or matriculated over into the youth program. So they need young talent now to emerge from this trial. So where is this going to be held?
