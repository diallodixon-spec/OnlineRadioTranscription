2025-12-12 11:27:57 All right, guys, Happy Lovers Thursday and welcome to the Sun City Youth Forum. It's your girl Queen Jojo. It's a space where young voices meet big conversations. And tonight we're tackling one of the most pressing concerns of our digital generation. Digital identity. Are Jamaican youths losing themselves online? That's the question. From TikTok personas to Instagram aesthetics, from online activism to digital peer pressure. The question stands, are young people shaping the internet or is the internet shaping them? All right. This conversation is brought to you by Alaska Serials. Start your day with Alaska Serials. Curves. Every girl Curves, the Ministry of Health and Wellness Youth Services Unit, and Wendy's Hamtastic. It's a hamtastic holiday only at Wendy's and the Council of Community Colleges of Jamaica, certifying quality assurance.
