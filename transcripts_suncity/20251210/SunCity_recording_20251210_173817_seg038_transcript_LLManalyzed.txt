============================================================

We're not to hear songs like these anymore. Big up to the artists still blazing the fire. Hot, hot, hot, hot. People like Kronix, Kabaka, Pyramid, Pro2J, among others. And like one time where everybody did a blaze of fire. We don't have a lot of artists out there blazing the fire, but thank God we still have these songs, so we'll be playing them over and over and over again forever. Them songs are killed. So if you're dealing with corruption, yeah man, just hold a fire burn.
