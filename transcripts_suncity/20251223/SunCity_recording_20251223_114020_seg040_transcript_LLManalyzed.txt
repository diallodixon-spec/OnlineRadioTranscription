20251223 114020 Tonight we a go touch a party Oh and when you apart with me And good time is guaranteed Fill up your vibes and get tired Tonight we do a lifestyle baby I go save a new life peep peep blan on my style baby I say we have a new life we feel happy like a Christmas land give me the disgust man and rule is still rich are in a recession ten pound of food a day is none This is not a discursion, it's a bomb We'll leave a stack in my shoes and we'll drop it from Head when it's down, skin when it's brown They kinda shit at me flying like a pelican You better be wise, don't give me vibes, they got nothing
