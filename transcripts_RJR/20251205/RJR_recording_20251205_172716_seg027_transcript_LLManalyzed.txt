was one of the entities that spoke this week before the Public Accounts, Public Administration and Appropriations Committee of Parliament, PAAC. And of course, as you know, all eyes have been on the utilities. They've been restoring lots of people not entirely happy about the restoration pace. So what is the OUR doing about all of that? We're going to be speaking in just a moment with the Deputy Director of the OUR, Cedric Wilson. Okay, so we don't quite have him yet, so we're going to have him in just a moment. Let me just remind you in the meantime of our WhatsApp line, it's 8 7 6 5 5 3 5 9 0 8. 8, 7, 6, 5, 5, 3, 5, 9, 0, 8. I was just reading, reading, watching a post on the Jamaica Observer Instagram page.
