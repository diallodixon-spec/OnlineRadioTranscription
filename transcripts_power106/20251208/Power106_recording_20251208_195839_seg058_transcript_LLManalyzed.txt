all the time. It's lots more fun than fishing in the snow. In the West, in the West, every Christmas is a time for all to smile. There's no winter time, there's just sweet sunshine at Christmas Jamaican style. Lots of green in mid-December, Fragrant flowers, sweetly blue. Sunshine, fragrant flowers, sweetly blue Sunshine Christmas greetings I extend to you Just come on over, there is room Make yourself at home this evening
