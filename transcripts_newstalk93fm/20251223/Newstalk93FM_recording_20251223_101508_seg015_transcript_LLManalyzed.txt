20251223 101508 Am I your way? Moon on your skin Hands round your waist Music is love And I heard you not play The way how you moving Got me feeling away Away, away Been a while flexing, yo, yo Call me like I say you have the best thing for true Hotel, suite, sky view, view Oh, hey! Is this a dream? Am I awake? Moon on your skin?
