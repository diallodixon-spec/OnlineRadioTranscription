20251219 152015 I'm not here to make you have a life You're not here to give me the right to love life Never want to be up when I don't talk I'm here to give you the right to have a life You still be hiring, cause we no love life Every time I rise, we do it for the love, we no do it for the life Do it for the love we not do it for the likes. You know I really love that song. I remember back in the day when Jeremy used to play it on Nora. I don't know why every time I hear the song, I always envision myself a greater coconut. You guys are true. She always say that. She always say it for true. It's a great song.
