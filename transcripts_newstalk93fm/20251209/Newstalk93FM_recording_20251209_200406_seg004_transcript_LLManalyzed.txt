============================================================

I'm not coming home tonight. To you, to you We don't have to fight baby Come and take a take our life with me. I'll fend till the sun replace the moon. Don't send us a spandex of my name. I'll turn the road a-line me. Tell them that it's all that I have made. Hey, hey, you won't see me Wednesday. Don't send a spandex my name. I lost my mind.
