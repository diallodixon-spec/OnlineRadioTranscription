I will trust in you My God! There is a champion Who is the king? Victorious warrior Full of everything I rock my shelter I carry on Less than a dealer Who reigns upon a throne There is a fountain Who is the king of kings Who is the king He's my victorious warrior And he's my lord He's my lord of everything He's my wire up my shoulders
