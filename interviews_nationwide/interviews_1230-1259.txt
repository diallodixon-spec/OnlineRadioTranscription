Jamaica Boxing Association President Stephen "Bummer" Jones Outlines Plans for Elevation of the Sport

In a recent interview, President of the Jamaica Boxing Association (JBA), Stephen "Bummer" Jones, discussed the organization's plans to improve the profile of boxing in Jamaica. Jones noted that the association is focused on raising standards both inside and outside the ring, with a renewed emphasis on infrastructure, athlete development, and visibility.

According to Jones, the refurbishment of the Stanley Couch Gym is the association's top priority. The upgraded facility will serve as the JBA's main base of operations, providing a consistent and supportive environment for athletes to train and develop. Jones also highlighted the importance of hosting key programs for the sport's growth, which will be made possible by the refurbished gym.

Jones reflected on the recent performances of Jamaican boxers, stating that 2025 was a strong year for the sport, with improved results and increased activity on the local scene. He attributed this success to the association's efforts to keep the grassroots pipeline active, providing a consistent platform for fighters to perform and develop.

The JBA's plans for elevation are centered around the concept of "elevation," which Jones believes will guide the organization's decisions and actions. With a focus on infrastructure, athlete development, and visibility, the JBA is poised to take Jamaican boxing to new heights.

In related news, the JN Group Race for Hope 5K and Kids Fun Run 2026 is scheduled to take place on January 18th at Hope Gardens, with the goal of raising funds for the redevelopment of Hope Gardens and supporting women entrepreneurs in Western Jamaica affected by Hurricane Melissa.
