20251217 092116 You said you are doing this in phases. Do you have a timeline for the completion of the National Energy Poverty Reduction Project? The focus we are on right now is the end of the fiscal year, which is March 31st. And so between now and March 31st, we intend to really achieve the numbers I spoke about earlier. And so as we roll out the program, we will come back and we can talk some more. But certainly, if anything, listen and follow the JSEF and you'll get all the information you need on this program. Awesome. And for persons who want to continue listening and want to follow up with JSEF, especially where these sign up events will happen, how can they find more information or reach out to you? Well, our website is JSIF.org. Our email is info at JSIF.org and our phone line is 876
