The storm is over, we shall rise We tell from others who support our cause Holding firm memories of the lives we've lost As we shed the lace of the angle light Through the night illuminated from up light How me fee wash when me stress without no water nor the pipe When time me look to the hill some place me never used to sight Did in a plain view from trees that uproot overnight With day sharp look for bread Someday a road a look for zinc To replace the roof over them head Stormy, stormy night
