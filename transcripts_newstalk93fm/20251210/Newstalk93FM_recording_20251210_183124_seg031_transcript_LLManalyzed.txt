No one can ever love you better than me. No one in this life time. Good God, I'm yellow and you're pink. No one in his life, when she call for me And if you fall for me, probably your bad dream If your phone not your hand, anytime when you ask me I say you're fat, you need one, make it so hard for left Give it up for me, and admit me you feel hot Smooth girl, clean skin, now you know she not talking Anytime she get mad at you, you know she won't have it
