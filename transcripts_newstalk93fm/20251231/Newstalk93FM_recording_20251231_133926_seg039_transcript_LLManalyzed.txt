20251231 133926 Tell me what you'll do I'm in a big mood Call out and feel you Something you? I know, say, your love comes passing my knee, but I still want you. I'm in a beat mood, girl, I don't want you. Not only you, every girl on my back, there ain't nobody but you. Every night I go to the rock here, but you. Baby, girl, we go there, no solo. Nobody feed, tell me to leave my baby, you. Bend every 90 feet on to baby, you. Me and you, when you wake up, girl, you splashing up.
