============================================================

I feel the need for you tonight Over my little apple I'd certainly take a bite My poor body's calling It needs attention fast Till you're here beside me baby That's how long this pain's gonna last. You gotta come back home. Come back home. You better come back home. Gotta come back home. Can't remember how long it's been. I sure lost track of time. Don't ask me how I do it, I can't say I'm doing fine My world is just a derby, everything is upside down It's no use explaining, got to come see what's going on
