And she sayin' something for me. I tellin' you, I love whenever you bring a vibe. With your hands them up in the sky. What we drunk and havin' a time. Carnival time again. And we have all money to spend. And we go right down to the end. Watch me with me cannibal friend. Cannibal friend, meet, meet, rumble, beat, beat, beat. Things so sweet, sweet, sweet. Feel complete, cause we love you back and now. Beat, beat, rumble beat, beat beat, things so sweet.
