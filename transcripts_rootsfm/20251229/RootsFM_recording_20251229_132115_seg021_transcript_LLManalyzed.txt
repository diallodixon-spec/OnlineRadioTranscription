Keep your head high Your time is your case Who do you listen to? Roots of Hell 96.1 Keep your head high We can make all change, baby Hey, love is on the way, keep up Hey, We can make a change Give up, don't, give up, don't give up Every mekule mackle if we try Different one another in these times Every dollar, every cent to save a child Give us a star, a brother, better life Times are so hard, you know we only think good to me
