20260102 174336 Human Rights Lobby Group, Jamaicans for Justice, JFJ, raised concerns about the possible impact on children convicted of murder. Executive Director, Michail Jackson. We believe that generally when it comes to child justice matters, the full discretion should be within the remit of the courts. It will worsen the prison overcrowding challenges that we have and it undermines the principle of rehabilitation and child justice. Jamaica's first woman director of public prosecutions, Paula Llewellyn, retired in September after 17 years on the job. It has been a great pleasure. To my successor, I wish all the very best. It's not an easy task.
