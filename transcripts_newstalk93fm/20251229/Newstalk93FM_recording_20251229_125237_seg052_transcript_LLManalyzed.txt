20251229 125237 don't let me down easy if you're gonna leave me baby go and leave me all the way don't ask for all your things back cussing out hate. Don't let me down easy. If you're gonna leave me, baby, go and leave me all the way. If it's over, it's over, so f*** it. Just don't act like my love wasn't nothing. Like I wasn't the one you was holding that night, telling all of your secrets and hugging. Guess you're right, it's too good to be true. What's important, all I needed was you. But time after time, all this fussing and fighting, it's time that you do what you do. And it's cool. Mama said it was fish in the sea, I got lost in the pool Knew it was coming, I watched how you moved How you turned your back on me and laid me to lose Remember the text, how you said that you'd do Said that you'd never leave, we would fight till it's due But as it went on, I was fighting for you
