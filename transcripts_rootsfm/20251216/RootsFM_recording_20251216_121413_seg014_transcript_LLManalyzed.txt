20251216 121413 Oh, give thanks unto the Lord, for he is good. We thank you this afternoon, O God, for the joy that has come. Truly as a people, we have experienced your joy, truly individual and collectively. We have experienced your joy. The joy that you gave and the joy that the world cannot take away. We salute you, we shabak you, we worship you God, we glorify you, we extol your matchless name and we just give you a thanks. What a God you are. Worthy is the lamb that was slain. Worthy, O God, is the lamb, the risen lamb. O God, we thank you. Your name is Emmanuel, the God who is with us. God, you never change. We thank you.
