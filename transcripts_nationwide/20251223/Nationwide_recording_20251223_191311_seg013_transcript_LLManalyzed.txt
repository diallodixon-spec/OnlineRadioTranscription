20251223 191311 is healthy with the plant the drink so somebody on youtube has said that they've had the sorrel in the fridge since 2013 so oren says when you open that box it must feel like when you have long time pepsi somebody else says doc please speak to roti sorrel from 2013 and me feel so that poison. No, it depends on what is in it. It can be a wine. So remember, wine gets better with age. So sorrel can taste stronger and richer with time. So how are you preserving it? If you have rice, some persons will add rice to the container and that helps to pull some of the water from the sorrel mixture and it preserves it longer and you can then add yeast and make it ferment. So there are different ways and it can turn into a great drink. It's like wine. Interesting. From 2030, no doubt.
