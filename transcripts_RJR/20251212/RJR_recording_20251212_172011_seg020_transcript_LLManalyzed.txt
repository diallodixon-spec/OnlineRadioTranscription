20251212 172011 release of a statement confirming the IFC's validation of the temporary suspension. The fiscal commissioner said fiscal discipline on the execution of the budget. So even though there are no fiscal rules during this period operating, but the government still has to set some targets within which it will operate. Because bear in mind, the suspension is just for a period until March 2027. So what we don't want to happen is a situation wherein, after the period of the suspension, we are so far behind that it would take some Herculean effort to really get back on track. Hence that monitoring will be important even during this period of suspension.
