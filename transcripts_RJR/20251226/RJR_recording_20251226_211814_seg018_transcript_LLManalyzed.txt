20251226 211814 When we need money, they sponsor me. I know my God is real, so watch it blast for me. I know the devil at work, he can't conquer me. I go through this and go through that. Can't go through that, can't go through. I do things to face a jury, but I never judge you. My father gotta feel me back, even though when we go through things, it's like I gotta sneeze my uncle one for you. Bless you. Father, protect the crew. Don't forget where they come from. Show them the road. No father have no faith and no trust in trust in a you. Them to believe, we are giving them both. Lord, ask you guide my path. You know the stress I have. Even when they rise against me, I pray I never fall. The devil tried before, but this time you must know. My God never sleeps this is the one i choose lord i give you the glory
