So let's say your property is insured for $25 million, but the actual value of that property is $50 million. It means that you're underinsured by 50%. If you have suffered a loss and the total loss amount is $2 million, that loss amount will be reduced when you're being paid by 50%. So your claim settlement would be a million dollars because it is reduced by the same amount that you insured your property. And again, yes, all our policies are subject to that average clause. The other part of that question, the virtually I can't answer, but I take the point as to whether or not we will be willing to suspend the average clause. It's not something that has been discussed or a decision has been made, but I'll certainly take the point and pass on the feedback and we can discuss it internally. Good to know that
