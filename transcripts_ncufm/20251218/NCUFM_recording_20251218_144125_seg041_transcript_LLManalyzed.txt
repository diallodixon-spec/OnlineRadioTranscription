20251218 144125 I got angels watching over me. Banning the weight, the hurt, the pain. I got angels watchin' over me. They'll never fly away. Angels over me. They silently hold me With their mighty wings When I cry, they consume me With the song they sing And when I sleep, they watch over me. There's been a wave of things. These are my angels over me.
