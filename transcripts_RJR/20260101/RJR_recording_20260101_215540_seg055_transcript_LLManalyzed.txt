20260101 215540 I'm not afraid of people, I'm afraid of people, lots of people are afraid of me. Just hide me in the streets and me out at night, mother, they'll read Bible for me. Me no love likes. They never tell you the force of pressure, but spite. because I'm a friend of mine. I'm a I'm, so I don't like your style, boy. I don't want to make you do that. You got my name on two cups. Love your baby, you that. Then I'm gonna find you like two rats. I'd better say I love you. You're not young, you're not humble. You're mad, I see you. You don't have access, now you're who, that. Never let my mood light you, that's it. Feel some voice, I'm gonna move and wave. You're gonna see a vehicle, two of them dark, and a big, big, big. Scooby-doo, that, that. Looking in the glass, you know I'm gonna serve, so I'm never gonna be nice.
