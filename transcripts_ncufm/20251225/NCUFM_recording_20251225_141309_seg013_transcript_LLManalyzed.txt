20251225 141309 we're looking at Christian Ethics so this one is for my university students out there. At 5 we'll be having news at 5 inside the drive and then our sports update at 6. I want to try and see if we can get an interview through at 5.30 but if anything we have music to fill and keep you company. And yes it will be that way until we get ready to park the bus for this festive edition of the drive at 6.30. So I hope you're ready in our drive time family because I am that man. I'm ready to go. I am ready to go and have a fantastic time with you. Alrighty, so keep back, relax and continue to enjoy this groovy little hit.
