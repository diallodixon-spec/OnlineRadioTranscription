20251217 160003 Yeah, let me just say this. Sure. Here in the country, the water situation was very bad. Right. I went through, I went through Ampton coming down. Yeah, Ampton, Ampton, Rowampton. Rowampton, Valley Bush coming down. And I pick up a lady with a young baby. I seen her, she was walking. I stopped her after she was on the right. She was going down the road. And I picked her up and dropped her down the square. And I asked her, I said, do you have? She said, no. Do you have water before the hurricane? No. So those people, I cannot, yeah. Again, this is not remote. It's just in the country. But they don't have water, fine. So they're kind of used to it. But there are people in this town of Manchicope that right now don't have no water stills. At Wellington Dental, they offer cleaning, filling, whitening, and other services for the entire family.
