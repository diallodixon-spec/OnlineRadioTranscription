20251226 095045 Let's go back to the one of us now We'll make the next mistake of our lives Don't look back, don't look back Don't look back Oh, now they can see the tears in our eyes But we've been blinded by the pain that lies deep in our hearts Well, maybe that's a thing we can't hide from the world Cause everybody knows that we're both torn apart Why do we really talk about you? Why do we look small? Why do we listen to the water? Why do we wait until the time comes to stop? Why do we never stop?
