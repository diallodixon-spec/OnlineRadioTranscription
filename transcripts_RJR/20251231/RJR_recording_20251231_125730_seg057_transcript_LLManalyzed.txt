20251231 125730 oh no you know i can't imagine and um can't imagine the dissents grief you know please be careful they have to watch them you know have to watch out look out for them boy anyhow it's can we excuse another call in or maybe not yes well maybe i'm a bit of course you know we are at near to the end of 2025 life goes on those who will be facing the new year without having their loved one with them or friend and it's going to be a challenging time so even while we express salutations and greetings and want to spread the joy around we know too that there are many who at this time can't receive it in the way it is intended, because they are grappling with this sense of loss. There are others too who have lost family members years ago even, and especially around this time. They're missing them, you know.
