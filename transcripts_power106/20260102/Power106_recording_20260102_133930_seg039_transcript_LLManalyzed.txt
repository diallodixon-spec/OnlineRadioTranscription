20260102 133930 be more aware. Most of us don't really understand how the country works and that is why we get frustrated because we don't really understand the country. If we take the time to figure out how the country works, we will understand what we need to do, but we don't. We have to read the Constitution, we have to understand what the different government agencies, what they're there for. A lot of these things we don't have a time to do. Do we need to teach that in school? So when they don't understand those things, then frustration come in. So we need to teach those things in school. Yeah, but not only in school, we need to make sure it is standard no matter what school you're going to. I hear you. All right, my brethren, we talk again for the rest of this year, hopefully. Yeah, man. All right, good, good. What else have I got here?
