20251222 124020 I'll remember you The dreams we could have dreamed The tears I should have seen We used to say forever I'll remember you Your instable heart The shadows in the dark I will always love you, I'll remember you. Oh, and I remain alone no matter who they try to take your place. Oh, I'll remember you, the dream we could have dreamed, tears I shed.
