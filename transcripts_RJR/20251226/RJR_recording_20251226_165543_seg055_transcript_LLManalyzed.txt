20251226 165543 I'm dripping, baby. The way you take me today, can't leave me like Sayadee Madhu. The way you carry me pain, oh my god, leave me like Karim Adu. Girl, girl, you're burning me up, oh. Every day you are burning me up oh. Girl, you're turning me up oh. Every time I look at you, you're turnin' me up oh. Yeah, you're taking me up oh. The way you want it, you're takin' me slow. Girl, you killin' me oh, to do me? I go faster. Anytime I call her, she must answer. Oh, my baby, what's up? Oh, my baby what's up? I love the way you spread it out for me. Put your pen down.
