that do the evaluation, but it's for free. I think I pay $175 to get the degree evaluated. To evaluate the degree, I need a transcript under three months. So I had to get a transcript from Michael, and I'm telling you, that was a lengthy process. I knew someone there, so that expedited for me, and I got the transcript, and I took it in, and they evaluated it. So my GPA at the time was 3.63. After they evaluated the degree here, they gave me a GPA of 3.03. Okay. So it went down significantly. So that's what I used to get the job. Yeah. Okay. All right. So what was your kind of mindset going in first day? I was nervous because I'm saying, you know, people always say that it keeps them over here. They don't have any manners and my trick way of running my classroom, I don't know.
