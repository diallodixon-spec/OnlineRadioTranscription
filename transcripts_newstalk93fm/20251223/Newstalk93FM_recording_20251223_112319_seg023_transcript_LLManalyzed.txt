20251223 112319 I will never let you go I hear one thing I have to say to you I just see love in it and let me gravitate to you Give me the compass, let me navigate to you Fly up and sail on my way to you Deep as the blue sea, your love's flowing into me And even though the waves out from this love, the waves are deep as Lucy, deep as Lucy. I said this love is so strong. We won't run. No, no, no, no. This love is deep as Lucy. This love is as deep as can be. yeah. Deep as the dark blue, yeah. Kavaka and me, oh, oh, oh. So accurate. So deep as, baby, so deep as. I said I need your love. One's deeper than you and me, yeah.
