first hold on the Conker Cup when they face off with the Dominican Republic in the second leg final at the National Stadium this evening at 7. Unpleasant currently hold a 1-0 lead on aggregate from the first leg final in the Dominican Republic last week. Although only holding a slender lead, head coach Theodore Tappowitmore says they're right where they need to be heading into the second leg final. Just a few days we're having a discussion and even said to the staff it might sound a way but I'm glad we're not going into this tie with a two goal advantage. I think one is enough so we know that we have something to play for. We've been mean in terms of giving up goals in this tournament so far and we want to continue that way. We think we have enough to damage this team in the final turn once we can take our chances.
