I just want to send out condolences once again to the family and friends of the Nayangkopong Maroons who lost their Secretary of State a week ago. Last evening was the nine night and of course, you know, still in mourning for sure. And of course, will keep us updated about the funeral service for her. I interviewed her here, so did String, right here on Roots FM and, you know, very articulate attorney-at-law who played a major role in the Maroon government of Nayang Kapong. All right, so, you know, yeah, we're going to debrow more because I could have never played one minute of that song, you know, but we're going to have to take a break, right? Yeah. So we're taking this one from the top. You don't know. Big tunes at 133.
