There are other things that are so pressing that I really wish I could have accomplished. Am I going to drive myself crazy to say I never got it done? No. I am going to acknowledge that it's quite painful to look at what wasn't done and then now make the steps to make sure that 2026 is a better year. And hear me out. It don't mean say you're going to make more money, it don't mean you're going to be rich and wealthy. Yes, we want all those things. But what if we can use 2026 to be that year that will really sharpen up our character? We'll really go on our purpose. We'll really try to reach out for something greater than ourselves. Amen.
