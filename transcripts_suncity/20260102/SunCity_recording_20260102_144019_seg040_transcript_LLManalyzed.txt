20260102 144019 Till the clouds roll forever from the sky Hold me fast, let me stand In the hollow of thy hand Keep me safe, till the storm passes by. Ooh, when the long night is ended and the storm comes no more, let me stand in the presence of the right people. Oh, in that land where the tempest never comes, may I dwell.
