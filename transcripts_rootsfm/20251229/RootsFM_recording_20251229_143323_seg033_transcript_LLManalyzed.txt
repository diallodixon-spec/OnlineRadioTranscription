20251229 143323 don't love you don't love you it's high time now just one bracket line who wants to live it in trouble and strife my mind must be free to learn all i can about me i'm gonna love me for the rest of my day. Encourage the babies every time they say self-preservation is what's really going on today. I say I'm gonna turn loose, a thousand pounds a day But I say I'll turn loose when I just can't break away Oh, young hearts, run free They'll never be hung up, hung up like my man
