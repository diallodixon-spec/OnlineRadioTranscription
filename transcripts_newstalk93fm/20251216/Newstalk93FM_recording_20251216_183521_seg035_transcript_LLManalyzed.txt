20251216 183521 Tonight it's all on me With you I wanna take my time Girl I got to justify Hey, she's enough to wait, too late today Need me right now, face to face I see you like that, what pleasure me pay Hit the right spot, I'm making knees Shake with me if you are just sesame Here's some for you, sesame You bring your body know your promise and never leave I know she don't wanna wait too long Wait too long, gonna be too late Lockdown with me girl, stay through dawn Stay through dawn, cause the day's so bright Tell you baby, you don't have to wonder. Can we stay for longer? Stay from the day of break. May all my enemies come to be for me. Many try but fail if they come in my way.
