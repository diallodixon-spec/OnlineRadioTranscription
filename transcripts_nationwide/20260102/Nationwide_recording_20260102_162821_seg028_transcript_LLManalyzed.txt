20260102 162821 Nobody try and tell him nothing about me Cause I'm me in love and I'm him in love Now try and tell me nothing nothing bout him Cause I'm him me in love and I'm me in love Me no matter what the code wanna say If you're full of people in your life You you're your man Never make it and your man never strive Shawty keep on shippin' you are my man All when things seem slow you are my man Always and forever you are my man No girl can mash up my land Shawty keep on shipping you are my man
