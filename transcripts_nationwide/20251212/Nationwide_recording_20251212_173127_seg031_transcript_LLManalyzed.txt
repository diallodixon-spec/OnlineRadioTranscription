The West Indies batters made 335 runs combined in both innings and of course they were inserted after New Zealand won the toss on the opening day. None of the West Indies players managed to get a half century. The closest they came to that, Che Ho, the white ball captain, he got a 48 and of course Kevin Hodge got 35, Justin Greaves got 25. Chase said the Westin is definitely going to need a lot more runs number of batsmen getting some starts but we didn't really convert into anything big so we thought that we left some runs out there in the first innings and we thought that we would have gotten those runs in the second innings but it didn't happen so very disappointing for us after the bowlers really put up their hands and brought us back
