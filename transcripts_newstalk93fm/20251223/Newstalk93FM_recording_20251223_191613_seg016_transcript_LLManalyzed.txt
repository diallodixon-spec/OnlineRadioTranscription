20251223 191613 You too precious to me to only love you for the night. The feelings when me feel for you, you know that you're my type. Make my light shine bright, ready to sign the dotted line. I know you're anxious, you want me to touch it, girl. But welcome, trust me, I want you to trust it, girl. The stars and the moon shine for us,, love, sweat, sweat, sweat for it. Love, love. Can't just give me my love. So many men that I dream of my love, so many men that I work for my love. So many men, that I kill for my love, So many men get that shirt for my love. But let me tell you, I ain't really got the time. The plan I gave for you, I'm too much of a dime.
