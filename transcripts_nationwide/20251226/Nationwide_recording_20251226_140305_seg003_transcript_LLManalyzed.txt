20251226 140305 The only thing that I know So get it easy now Remember that I could never pace me back And it's the only thing we take with us when we die Keep this love inside the crowd We make these memories for ourselves For our eyes, for our ears, for our hearts When we are gone, time's forever for us all to stay So you can keep, inside our game No hate, no tears, so you can keep. It's time for the game of your life. She's holding you close, it's a lie. You won't ever be alone. Don't let you hurt.
