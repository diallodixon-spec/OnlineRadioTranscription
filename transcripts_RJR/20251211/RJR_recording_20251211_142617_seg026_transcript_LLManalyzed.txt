We will be at the Harmony Beach Park. Beautiful Harmony Beach Park in Montego Bay. Well kept and that is why we are also encouraging folks in Montego Bay go and support the vendors. Go and support the business owners because trust me, things rough but we can keep them up and keep them going if we support them. Yes, and we know Western Jamaica, they need the support. They need to rebuild. So, come out and support our SME and support team Jamaica. We are a resilient set of people and we will rebuild. Nicholas Speed. I know you've been moving with speed and alacrity all day. I know you're going to continue to do that but remember, take some time and soak some water and technical cool share as we're here. Thank you, Jenny. I will. Thank you for having me. Nicholas Speed, manager of SME Business Banking at Sagicore Bank. Listen, we are here. Seventeen Dominica Jive, come down and support our SMEs.
