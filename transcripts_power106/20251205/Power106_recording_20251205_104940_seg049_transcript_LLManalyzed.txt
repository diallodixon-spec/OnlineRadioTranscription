When Andrew writes, he writes. And when he's wrong, he's wrong. If Mark Goulding is wrong, he is wrong. And if he's right, he's right. So we don't want your talk. We don't want you to talk wrong when it's wrong. And it's up on the wall. Everything you say, it's bigger than them coming to put you up there. So they don't want to hear from them. And I want to ask two more questions. Where's the JPS profit where they make Ralston a year-time? Where's the profit that they can't balance in a certain way? I'm not saying they can't borrow.5% of the JPS and the international investors own the other 80.5% so they come from foreign so they are sent for their money abroad.
