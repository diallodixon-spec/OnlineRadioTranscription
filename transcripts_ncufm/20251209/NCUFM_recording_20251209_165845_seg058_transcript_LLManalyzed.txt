============================================================

For a moment The favor is here And will be for me For all my lifetime You've turned my morning Into dancing You've lifted my sorrow I can't stay silent I must sing for your joy and come. Oh, oh, oh, oh. You've burned my morning. Oh, my morning. Into dancing, oh. This is my song. I can't, I can't sing, I can't. I must sing for you joy and come.
