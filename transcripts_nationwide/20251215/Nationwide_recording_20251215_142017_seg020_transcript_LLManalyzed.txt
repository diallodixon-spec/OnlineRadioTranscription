20251215 142017 See no much less of all the hoes a **** the winner Have a right foot like a dog with fear The madda still a selly in the market The jam-pack is a precious stone Stealing balls from a diamond, take it from iron You know the man say, he say I feel like I couldn't find a place for sleep But then everything we have to find food for head Every day we tell the world best way down for east And the team know my job and the team get my rate And then my play come over here Indian and cheap From the purse to the kelp, straight up to 7th Street I'm singing now with my naffy jam to the base I make it in a live or in a rhythm to me
