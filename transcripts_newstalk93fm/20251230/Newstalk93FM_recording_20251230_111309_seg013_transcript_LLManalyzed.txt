20251230 111309 The summer breeze when we talk What we have is endless Take away all my stress It's so familiar and still so brand new Every day with you feels like deja vu Like we've always known it Loved you before we met Kiss me always from sunlight to moon rays January to December Loving you is summer forever Stars shine on us Keeping our secrets January to December
