20251230 125341 I can't find a cure, but I ain't gonna give in I have been living in a yoke in a media I can't find nothing, but I have to pay my rent in a yoke, in a media Home with children on the streets Shining cow windows, no shoes on their feet While the rich boys, children, are dressed to play For people, children suffer and live long days But I ain't gonna give in I have been living in a hut in a graveyard I can't mind a cent, but I have to pay my rent In a hut, in a graveyard To be ambitious is just a waste I tell you there's a system, it's a big disgrace Down here on the rock, they suffer from greed Different people come from a different breed But I ain't gonna give in, I have been living in a yard in the media I can't find a cent, but I have to pay my rent in a yard
