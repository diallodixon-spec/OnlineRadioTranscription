20251231 143316 Good morning class, good morning students. Good morning teacher. Now I want somebody to tell me what are the three E's of Sun City 104.9 FM radio with a difference. Who can tell me? Me, me, me, me. Teacher, educate, empower and entertain. Give her a clap, give her a clap. Very good, very good. Here at Sun City 104.9 FM, our mandate is to educate, Sun City. Sun City. We're going to ride. Sun City.
