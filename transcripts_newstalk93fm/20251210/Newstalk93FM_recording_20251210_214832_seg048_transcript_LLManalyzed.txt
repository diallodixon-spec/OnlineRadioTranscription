Daisy's bad-naked, I was distraught He loves me not, he loves me not Penny's unlucky, I took him back And then I stepped on my feet and then step on the crack and the black cat laughed and baby I live it up been a little superstitious fingers crossed until you put your hand on mine it seems to be that you and me, we make our own love A bad sign is all good I ain't got a knock on wood All I miss is wishing on a falling star Never did we end it good
