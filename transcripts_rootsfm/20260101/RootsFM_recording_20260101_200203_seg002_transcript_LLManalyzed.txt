20260101 200203 I've had some reason to live in my low love Lifting higher, harder Stop me screaming to the Lord, boy Kiss me, pray we don't overflow Baby, I know you can feel it pull Deep in the peak of my waterfall Rock it, baby, rock it, baby Rock it till the water falls Damn. Oh, oh, oh, oh. Oh, oh. Oh. Oh. Oh! Oh! Oh, oh! Oh! Oh!
