20251222 151111 The worst part about being on vacation is coming back from vacation. You have to be telling yourself you have to come out of the funk and you have to return to work because I almost didn't make it today. Did you go outside last night? No, no, I haven't been outside. I mean I haven't been doing anything. I've just been relaxing, thinking, reflecting, making decisions. Thank you two more days to go
