20251226 212725 I'm not coming home tonight. I'm not going home tonight. You can't sign the party. You can't send us be afraid Remember the words I say Wednesday I'll be coming home to you To you, to you We don't have to fight baby Come and take a life with me Aspire to the sun, replace it more Don't send us to parties of my name I out on the road, I lie me Tell them that it's over, I have made it I won't see me Wednesday Don't send us a bandit of my name I lost on the road
