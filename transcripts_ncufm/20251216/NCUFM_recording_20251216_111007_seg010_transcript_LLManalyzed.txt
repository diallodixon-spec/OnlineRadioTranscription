20251216 111007 God knows the pain that you have tried to hide for many years In heaven there's no crying, but I'm sure I see his tears He's bleeding and he's saying You can't do this on your own You don't have to run, there's nothing He doesn't already know Trying to find hope in a needle Trying to pull strength from a cigarette Giving pieces of yourself to make Each with regret. Don't give up alone, don't give up alone. Because God will never give up on you.
