20251226 183919 Introverted can't make friends pray for better days. That's 300k when my day ends Do you remember last night? I blacked out and I all white dress with a back down so be careful with a heart because it's fragile and think about a pass with a lash out Any problem I beat in one car if we like me my dog funny you hang pictures on my wall Backseat made back life is life. So what the stars like the satellite AP on my arm and it's shining bright All I do is sit around and wait for a better day. I could use a break. Can I get an amen? All I do is just sit around and wait a better day. Better, better, better day.
