I need somebody who can take control I know exactly what I need to do Cause I don't wanna be alone tonight, Alone tonight, Alone tonight Look what you made me do I met somebody new new Ooh, baby, baby, I'm dancing with a stranger Look what you make me do I'm a somebody new Ooh baby, baby, and dancing with a stranger Dancing with a stranger I wasn't even going out tonight But boy I need to get you off of my mind I know exactly what I have to do I don't wanna be alone
