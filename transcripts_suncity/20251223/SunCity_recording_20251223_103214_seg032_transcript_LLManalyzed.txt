20251223 103214 Great week, man. All right, Alastair. I'm out. 104.9, Sun City Radio. Thank you so much, guys, for participating in Hello Jamaica this morning. We'll be back tomorrow for our, well, is it print big priority Wednesday? And we look forward to talking with you. Have yourself a wonderful day. Don't go anywhere. Up next is a Sun City Radio 104.9 FM, the radio with the difference. This Christmas, choose life. As we recover from Hurricane Melissa's devastation, we're reminded that life is fragile.
