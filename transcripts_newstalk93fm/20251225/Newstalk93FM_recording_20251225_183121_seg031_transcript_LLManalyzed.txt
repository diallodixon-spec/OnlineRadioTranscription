20251225 183121 Come and bite it up, just a little winding up Come and meet me in the truck and we rev it up Whole day, keep throwing it back at the way you stop Baby no way, we could post up all the pictures you want When you're ready, I go over here Darling, you go over there But we could meet in the middle and start a bacchanal Play in the middle, hey, what we gon' do now Jam to a rhythm in the heat, I can't evil, but in the heat, hey can we talk some business you know i want your company and it's nothing too risky limited liability don't worry if you try all the things i like you could still be shy in the morning so don't feel away
