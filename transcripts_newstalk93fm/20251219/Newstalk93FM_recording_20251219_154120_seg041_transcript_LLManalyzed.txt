20251219 154120 Something so out of the ordinary. I want you laying me down to a dead and buried. On the edge of your night, staying drunk on your vine. The angels up in the clouds are jealous knowing we found something so out, of the ordinary. You got me kissing the growl, growl sanctuary. Try to meet what you're taught Oh Lord, return me to dust The angels up in the clouds Watch out, let's know what we found Talk to me, talk to me Looks like we're making up for lost time Need you to spell it out for me Boston over on all nine It's like a type of alchemy
