20251231 211915 Fresh! Fresh! Fresh! In the 1980s, they used to call me Compral. In the 1982, they thought they'd call me Sergeant. But 84, from then on, I strictly knew that none. Cause a lieutenant is a lieutenant forever. Maybe we just rummaged down, saw a liar party. Lieutenant is a lieutenant forever, maybe we just rumble pure dance all at your party. For the loot and and is a loot and, not to revelry. Maybe we just, rumble pure dance, all at your partyyyyyyyyyyy. Fina manana one, fina manana two, loot and then switchy is the name, and then the music is the game. We're trapped in one fight, divide, divide, love me and the public day, as it's in our avenue.
