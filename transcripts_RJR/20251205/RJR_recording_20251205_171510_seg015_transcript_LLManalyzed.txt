I came here today and said, poor workmanship. I am deeply disappointed. And I don't know if there's anything in the contract that we can find the contractor. And I asked him to remedy the wrongs that was done in the construction of the building. It is one of those situations that taxpayer's money have been spent, but the work was not done. And I have to hold the Westmoreland Municipal Corporation and the ministry's technical team, I must hold them responsible for the fact that a building that is not even three years old has experienced a level of damage that the building has experienced. And when you look at the quality of the work, it speaks a lot to the desired. Local government minister Desmond McKenzie. In the meantime, the local government minister says the emergency procurement method will be used to effect repairs to the building. I have asked the technical team to give me two options. One, to slap the roof in its entirety.
