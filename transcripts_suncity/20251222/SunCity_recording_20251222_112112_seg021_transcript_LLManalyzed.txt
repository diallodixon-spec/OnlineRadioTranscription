20251222 112112 Wee! No! I don't know how to ride. On the lonely road, I get me practice some time. Front brake and gas up on the right hand side. Back brake up on the right, I hold the wheel tight. You shoot the brakes, and the wheel will bind. And if the road breaks, you will slip and slide. But if the bike is big, you just get the gas line. And use your indicator when you turn every time. You use up your mirror when you're all up behind. And when you take the corner, you don't take it too wide. Go tell them it's a catcher, man. They know how to be right. Learn, be right, be right, learn, be right.
