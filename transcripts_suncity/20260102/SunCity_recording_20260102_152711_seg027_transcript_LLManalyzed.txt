20260102 152711 Hey, hey, hey, hey. Hey, right, right. Light it up, light it up, now feel it light up. It's nothing when it's light. It's not ideal, but you know that's not right. If I get my shit up, it's a flash light. You up with that's either, then that's right. Love must flow like a dynamite. You feel pretty fine, give me, give me up, see what I can do.
