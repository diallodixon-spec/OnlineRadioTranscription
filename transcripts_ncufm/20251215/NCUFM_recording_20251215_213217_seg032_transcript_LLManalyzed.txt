He leads priests away stripped, and he overthrows the members of ancient families. He deprives the trustworthy of speech, and he takes away the discretion of elders. He pours contempt on noble men, and he loosens the girdle of the mighty. He uncovers mysteries out of darkness and he brings deep shadow to the light. He makes the nations great, then he destroys them. He expands the nations, then he guides them. He strips away the inside of the heads of the earth's people and he makes them wander in a pathless wasteland. They grope in the dark without light, and he makes them stagger like a drunkard. And this is where we take a break at Power in this page. Thank you for attending.
