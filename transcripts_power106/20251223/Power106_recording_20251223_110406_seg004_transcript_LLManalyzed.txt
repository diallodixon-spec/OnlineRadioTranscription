20251223 110406 Christmas girl, don't need you Love is fracking, playing in the sand I've got my capitone, getting on a tan Xotic, steady, boring lady, you're my man A perfect little highway, sounds like a plan We can sing it all afternoon We can make out your song, who we need to lose We can sail under the light of the moon Wish we could freeze this moment better That's right. that's right. Call me, I'll be fine, I'm gonna call you son. Christmas in Jamaica, here we come, we'll just stay nowhere. I'll wake up to some hockey outside, bitch. I'm gonna fall.
