20251222 131816 Hey, welcome back everyone, welcome back. Boy, I am getting some jokes here, you know. I'm getting some jokes here. Somebody says Nicki Minaj is a big supporter of her uncle up north. She's a Trinidadian too, I'm just thinking. Why are you troubling Nicki Minaj? Nicki Minaj just want to rap and be in peace. I don't know why not troubling Nicki Minaj. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Folk, I can tell you this, folk. I can tell you. Everybody will be involved if the United States hits Venezuela. If we're not even physically involved, our hearts are involved. Because Venezuela has had quite an interesting record with the Caribbean, selling us cheap oil.
