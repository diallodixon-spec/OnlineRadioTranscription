don't let me down easy if you're gonna leave me baby go and leave me all the way don't ask for all your things back cussing out my name yeah just to go and take back what you say burn all the bridges don't ask forgiveness walk away like I'm someone you hate Don't let me down easy If you gonna leave me, baby, go and leave me all the way If it's over, it's over, so f*** it Just don't act like my love wasn't nothing Like I wasn't the one you was holding that night Telling all of your secrets and hugging Guess you're right, it's too good to be true Was important, all I needed was you But time after time, I just wasn'tin' It's time that you do what you do And it's cool, mama said it was efficiency I got lots in the pool Knew it was comin', I watched how you knew How you turned back on me and laid me to lose Remember the text, how you said that you do Said that you'll never leave, we will fight till it's due But as it went on, I was fightin' for you Since the text was turned green, why the fuck it ain't blue? Get you done and I get it
