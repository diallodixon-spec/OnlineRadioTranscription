20251216 180506 I don't listen to nothing they say Every fat a drunk, jumping up Doing what I want, jumping up Tell them I ain't leaving Right there sleeping Every fat a drunk Jumping up Doing what I Want, jumping up Telling them I ain't living Right there sleeping Sometimes I just tell you I pull myself But I can't ease the tension Too much affect and boom man They say I'm too out of control But there's too much action Somebody pour a nexon Until my head gone and I'm miserable All down on the ground I cause a trouble Look how the security watch me They don't know about me I just mash up, they don't want me in their party.
