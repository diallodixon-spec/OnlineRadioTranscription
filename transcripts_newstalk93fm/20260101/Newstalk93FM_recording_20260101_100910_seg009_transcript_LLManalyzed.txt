20260101 100910 Nice and easy, so deeply we submerge under this emotion. Like an anchor, you keep me safe. I'm not afraid of the ocean. I keep you warm and cozy. You be coming on me arms when the storms approaching. So why funny? Whenever things like this titanic, the lighthouse, we are where I fall in. Deep as the blue sea, your love's flowing into me. And even though the waves are rough, this love is tough. Just love me. Deep as the blue sea, deep as the blue sea. Love me really and truly. And even though the storms will come, no, we won't run. Just love me deep at the blue sea. Wherever the wind may carry us, I will never let you go. One thing I have to say to you, I just love when it can make me gravitate to you. Give me the compass, let me navigate to you. Fly up the sail on my way.
