20251217 182318 I can be your lady. I'm a woman. I'm a mother, but they got a problem. Put some babies in your life and take away the drama. Put the paper in the picture like a diorama. Got to face a lot of people that are opposite. Because the world told me we ain't got the common sense. Got to prove it to myself that I'm on top of shit. And you would never know a guy without a goddess is honest. And I was kidding. I could be on everything. I mean, I could be the leader ahead of all the states. I could smile and jiggle and tell us pockets empty empty. I could be the CEO, just like a Robin Fenty. And I'ma be there for you, cause you on my team, girl. Don't ever think you ain't had these dreams, girl. They wanna pit us against each other when we succeed. And for no reason, they wanna see us end up like we Regina or Mean Girl. Princess or queen, tomboy or king? You've heard a lot you've never seen. Mother Earth, Mother Mary, rise the top Divine Feminine, I'm Feminine
