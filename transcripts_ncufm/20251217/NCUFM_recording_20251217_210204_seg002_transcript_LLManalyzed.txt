20251217 210204 When ye have transgressed the covenant of the Lord your God, which he commanded you, and have gone and served other gods, and bowed yourselves to them, then shall the anger of the Lord be kindled against you, and ye shall perish quickly from of the good land which he hath given unto you." So there are blessings contingent on obedience and there are curses that come to the disobedient. Israel already has experienced God's anger during the wilderness wanderings as well as in the promised land in Joshua chapter 7.
