20251225 125444 I won't even stay awake to hear those magic radio clicks But I just want you here tonight, holding on to me so tight What more can I do? All I want for Christmas is you, you. Oh, all the lights are shining so bright the everywhere. And the sound of children's laughter fills the air. And every word is singing I hear the snappers ringing Tell her won't you bring me the one I really need Please bring my baby to me, oh I don't wanna love for Christmas
