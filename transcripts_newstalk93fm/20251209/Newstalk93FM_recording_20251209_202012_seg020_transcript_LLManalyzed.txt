The way I do my hair, the way I make you laugh The way we like to share a walk in Central Park I could be fresh air, might be the girl of your dreams There's no need to hide if you're into me Cause I'm into you quite intimately And maybe one night could turn into three Well, I'm down to see cause I make it so Easy to Fall in love with me
