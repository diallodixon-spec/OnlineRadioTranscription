20251217 104935 good of our nation. Thank you, listeners. We're back with you on the hotline. I'm moving between outside and inside. I was in the yard. We're at 32 Lindus Road and over 50 people are here to pick up their packages and to sample the ham and the cake and just to get some love for Christmas. But I'm back in studio now for security matters, joining the Honorable Juliet Cuthbert Flynn, Minister of State and the Minister of National Security and Peace. Good to have you, Minister. Thanks for having me. Maybe you can send some of the ham over to me. What about the cake? And the cake. Oh, I thought you're watching something. Why I didn't mention cake. Not at all. Okay, but you're well. How are you, Mrs. Shields? I'm very well. And you? I'm good. I'm good. Yes. Right. So we're talking prioritizing national security during the Christmas season. Right.
