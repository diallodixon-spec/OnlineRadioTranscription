20251225 184337 I wanna do all I can just to show you To understand only you The only one who's gonna find the way When you're in my arms When I'm close to you There's a magic in your touch that just comes from you I want you everyday, I want you every night Begging only, waiting for me, you make it seem so right Girl, of course you took me inside, I let you show When life was about you, you were the only one who stole my heart
