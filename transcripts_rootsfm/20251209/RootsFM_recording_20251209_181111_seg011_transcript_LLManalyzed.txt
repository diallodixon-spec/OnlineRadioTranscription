If you're deaf, you can't hear, and if you're blind, you can't see. We want love in our country. Correct, you know, we want love in the country. Go make me tell you we are one big family. But first time if you're black, they said you have to stay apart. And first time, if you're brown, you could really stick stick around. And first time if you're white, everything was all right. But now the rich man and the poor man come together in one combination. Come right and now come make we build a better nation. We're not going to keep it in silence. Come you old man, we are going to fight against the violence. We you living in the town?
