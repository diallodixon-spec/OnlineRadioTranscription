============================================================

Somebody right now is listening to every word that I say. Depressed and confused, don't give your life away. You're at the edge of a long road. I was there just like you. God brought me through my trials. He'll do the same for you. That baby left me to die. God saved us before today. God loved him. He couldn't take my life away I'm standing right here As the living sits on his equator God is waiting there
