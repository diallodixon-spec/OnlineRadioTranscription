do some to that light, hit them strictly with that fire, fire fire, fire fire fire fire fire, hey Roman numeral seven bae, drop it like it's hot, if this world was mine I'd take it, dreams and make them multiply, if this word was mine, I'd take it enemies in front of God, introduce them to that light, get them strictly with the fire, this a bop, do your dance dance, let them watch She a fan, he a flop, they just wanna kumbayana This world concrete, flowers grow All day, she only doing what she know Weakens, get her popping on the low Better days coming for sure This world, world If it was love to me, I wouldn't give if nobody's no sympathy. I'd take away the pain, I'd give you everything. I just wanna see if this world would matter when you cry.
