20251226 151918 Just me when I say that I'll be okay You're everything but you never were And nothing like a part you could've been You're still here inside of me So tell me, do you care? You're the only one I wish I could forget The only one I love to not forget And you're the only one in my heart You're the only and though there are times when I hate you Cause I can't erase the times that you hurt me But put tears on my face And even now while I hate you It pains me to say I know I'll be there at the end of the day I don't wanna be without you babe I don't want a broken heart Don't wanna take a breath without you babe
