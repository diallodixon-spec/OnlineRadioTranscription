20251216 132113 Okay. May you talk about Venezuela. You got to come and see Venezuela people here, but let's leave that for another time. We come to JPS, right? Okay. Talk to me. I told you about negotiation. Yes. JPS is about to get a new license or whatever they're going to get, right? And the 150 OS, the oligarchy will have to benefit from the system. The oligarchy, because the oligarchy people who negotiate with JPS, they have to benefit enough. You just don't give $150 million like that and then... It's a loan from our pockets, Mark. Thank you. It's a loan for our pockets, it's a loan from Thomas and my pocket.
