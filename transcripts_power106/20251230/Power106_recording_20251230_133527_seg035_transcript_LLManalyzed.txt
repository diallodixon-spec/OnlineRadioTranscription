20251230 133527 Is it the low iron fruit people who have been indicted over the weekend? Are these the low iron fruits? They don't sound so low to me. A few of the names sound like mango that you'd have to actually climb the tree and go way up and take a risk and go on the limb and then put the little plastic bag on the stick, you know how that goes? And then put it and then, you have to have effort to bring in those names. Those don't sound like no hanging fruit to me. What you call it? The criminal investigation arm that works out of the Ministry of Finance. What do you call it? FID? FID. So the person who recently appointed to head that department, right?
