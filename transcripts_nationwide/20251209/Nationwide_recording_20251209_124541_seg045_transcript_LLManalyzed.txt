concern citizen concern citizen. Good morning. Yes. Good morning. And how are you? I am fine. How you do? I am good. Thank god. Yeah, man. Um here the problem I have now. Yes. I heard um you have a title, right? A register title and your parents passed away and leave you a will with the register title and I heard the government say that if you have something like that, you come to LAMP, and in two and three years, you will get your title. So I went to LAMP with my parents' title. No, first I went and I asked them what I need to get the title in my name, right? And they told me what and what I need. So I come and get the paper from them and I went and I paid the money. And my parents' tyke, my parents' death certificate, and my parents' will.
