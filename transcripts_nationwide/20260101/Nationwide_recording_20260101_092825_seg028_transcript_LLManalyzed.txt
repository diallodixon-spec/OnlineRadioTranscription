20260101 092825 I can't see too much love in any of the markets As high as a mountain and harder to climb Love is such a beautiful thing You make my world a summer day Are you just a dream to me? Nobody gets too much heaven now It's so much harder to get around I'm waiting in line Nobody gets too much love anymore
