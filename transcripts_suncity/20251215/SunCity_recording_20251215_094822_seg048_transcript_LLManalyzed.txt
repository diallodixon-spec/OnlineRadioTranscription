20251215 094822 You don't know who to believe. And you just said that you know your friends since childhood. All right, let me finish that. I don't who to believe. I'm afraid that choosing the wrong could cost me someone important. Who do I trust, my partner or my best friend? Who do you trust? Somebody you've known since childhood, why would she lie? But then as Jodie said there's some people that bad-mine you and you know There are women which is very sad to say that when they're single and you're in a relationship They don't want to see that they don't want that because they want it for themselves So sometimes they will say things of course mischief But I don't know if they're gonna go go as far as saying I've seen a man on multiple times and this is some stalker some single white female type of thing if you've seen that movie or fated attraction then unless it's that vibes I don't see women really saying how they've seen the person several times
