20251230 181108 Now that time I'll talk to you about that. The dominant religious groups are usually acknowledged and take precedence in participating in, for example, national events. So instead of acknowledging religious plurality, we say Jamaica is a Christian country. Thanks for that. I'm going to point out if Jamaica had any kind of legal or constitutional principle about the separation of church and state, for instance, our national anthem wouldn't be a christian prayer we wouldn't have prayer before the opening of parliament christian prayer and so on and so forth but thanks i understand where you're going but as i say another time for that hindon in saint angela says mr warmington is very mistaken he should be embracing the church during a Donors are looking for agencies that they trust and many donors would rather give to the church than to a government minister. So it's in the government's best interest to assist in getting the churches back up and running. All right. Thank you so much. Keep your comments
