20251223 102110 I don't want to put all the responsibility but I genuinely believe that we should know how to do you know some things look man everything now you buy her buying the chicken it's seasoned we're buying the color oil already seasoned you buy, you're buying the chicken, it's seasoned. We're buying the cauliflower, already seasoned and cut up. Right, we're buying the breadfruit roast. Everything. Everything, the curry chicken. Everything, yes. So when you get married now and you look at your wife and you say today we're going to so and so, so and so. What exactly are you going to do? Are you going to go to one of the stores to buy one of those chicken that is a rotisserie chicken and bring it home? That is what is going to happen some time. If we continue, that is what it's going to happen. I'm not saying that there are times when things are not easy.
