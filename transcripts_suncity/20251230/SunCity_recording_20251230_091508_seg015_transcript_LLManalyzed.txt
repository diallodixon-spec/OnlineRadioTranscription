What the churches need to do, those who have the denomination of churches close together, combine membership in the one building, because most of these churches, any one of them don't have them, very few people are in these churches. So the best they can do is combine the membership at one location, having all these structures all over the place. And my concern, I'm speaking as a member of parliament of South West Nicaragua. I'm speaking about capacity, whereby close to 11,000 people elected me. So I'm speaking where they are.
