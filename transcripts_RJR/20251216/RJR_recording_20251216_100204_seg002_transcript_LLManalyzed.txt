20251216 100204 of State yesterday met with Stein Hansen, director of the UNIDO Barbados Global SIDS Hub following the signing of a joint declaration in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia over two weeks ago. The Pan-American Health Organization has launched a framework which countries can immediately use to enhance hypertension and cardiovascular risk management, prevent heart attacks and strokes, and deliver better care through primary health care closer to people's home. Pahu said that the HEARTS approach is already transforming hypertension and cardiovascular risk care. Communities in Colombia, Mexico, Trinidad and Tobago and others have similarly increased control rates after adopting HEARTS standards. Farho says in the Dominican Republic, HEARTS is a government priority, providing free treatment to millions, while El Salvador expanded HEARTS across its primary healthcare network.
