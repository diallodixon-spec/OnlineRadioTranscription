20251223 130203 Yes sir, how are you doing? This man talked to me, what's up? The ambassador, who that you were interviewing? Where is the ambassador to? Curtis Ward. Okay. So once a person is an ambassador, they carry the title forever. That's the practice in the Western Hemisphere. So he's not a current ambassador. He's the former ambassador for Jamaica to the United Nations. Yeah. His name is Curtis Ward. So his name is Ambassador Curtis Ward. So politically, once you're an ambassador, you carry the title, all right? Right, right. No, I just wanted to, you know, because I never heard of him before. Wow. No, no, no.
