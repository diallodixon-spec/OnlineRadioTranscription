2025-12-11 16:16:29 You're just too good to be true Can't take my eyes off of you You be like heaven to us I want to hold you so much And long last love has arrived And I thank god I'm alive You're just to good to be true Can't take my eyes off of you Pardon the way that I stand There's nothing else to compare The sight of you leaves me weak There are no words left to speak But if you feel like I fear Please let me know that it's real You're just too good to be true Can't take my eyes off you I need you baby If it's quite alright I need you baby
