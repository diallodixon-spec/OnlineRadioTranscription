20251212 161206 This is my apology. Follow me. Come and see what you mean to all of me. You're a treasure in my eyes. The greatest pleasure in my life. Cause when you're living by the knee, honesty, hurry please. Home is where the heart should be. Pretty feathers in disguise. Not together we will rise. So don't you ever let me down So you better come through this time, please. Am I crying? Let you down my friend friend It was a misunderstanding So if I took it for granted You're not promised from today I go drunk, like I never drunk Waved like I never waved Wired like I never wanted to Just to show you I saw you, I saw you And I need you back in my life
