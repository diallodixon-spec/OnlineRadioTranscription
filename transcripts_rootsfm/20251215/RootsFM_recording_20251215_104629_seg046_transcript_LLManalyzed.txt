20251215 104629 We all live on, we won't know why no trouble, but we live it. It can got drunker. So please don't kill me. I know it's gonna kill me. I'm your skin, and I'm your stomach. I'm on a search. Hey, what's your name? Then we say darkness makes us appreciate lies. And the certainties of that make us appreciate lies. It's time to set the stage and overcome this stage right away. Just spread your wings and take flight. Cause if you don't feel well, I surely don't risk and I feel well. Oh yes, you can make me stronger.
