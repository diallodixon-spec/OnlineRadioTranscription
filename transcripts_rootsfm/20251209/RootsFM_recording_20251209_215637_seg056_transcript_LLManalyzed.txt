When every dark is fallen You know the spirit of the party starts to come alive until the day is dawning. You can throw out all the blues and hit the city lights. Cause there's music in the air and lots of loving everywhere. So give me the night. Give me the number Give me the E in action A piece of dine, a glass of wine, a little late romance It's a chain reaction
