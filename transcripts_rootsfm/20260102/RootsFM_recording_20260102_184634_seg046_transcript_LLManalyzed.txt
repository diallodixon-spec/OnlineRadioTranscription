20260102 184634 And I pray that she would surrender to me. Because she wasn't loved, but maybe too blind to see it is. Yet people keep spreading a whole lot of rumors on me. I can't get consent from her mama nor daddy. But I sing glory, glory, hallelujah. Like to give thanks and praise to the father. She loves me now She loves me now After my talk with the deacon and the elder Expressing my love for Malvina Never talk bout me if you come back tomorrow Gotta settle down and get married But see they now say the world a denser If she loves me now
