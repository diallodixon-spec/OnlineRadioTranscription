Charismatic reggae pioneer and actor Jimmy Cliff has died aged 81. With hit songs including Many Rivers to Cross, You Can Get It If You Really Want and Vietnam, Cliff also starred in and wrote the soundtrack to the landmark movie The Harder They Come. Cliff joined Kingston, Jamaica's emerging music scene in his teens and helped lead a movement in the 1960s that included such future stars as Bob Marley, Toots Hibbert and Peter Tosh. Music can highlight awareness and from that awareness people can take some kind of action to better the situation. I think that's the role music has played through the ages. Cliff was nominated for seven Grammys and won twice the best reggae album.
