============================================================

To feel your breathing Permanently Cause darling, I'm not leaving here Till I get what I've been waiting for Some 25 or more, that's all I need Oh, kisses in the moonlight Sugar, that would make this night complete There There's got to be. Oh, kisses in the moonlight. Sugar, fly away with me. Oh. Most of our days, we're so busy running. Lost in the maze, we've got no time for fun and dreams, but every night when the dream is real, this is how it feels.
