If you go I'm going to Cause it was always you And if I'm turning blue Please don't save me Nothing left to lose Without my baby Birds have a feather We should stick together Hey! Hey! Nationwide 90 FM Nationwide 90 90 FM. Yes! Till I'm out of way, dead and buried. Till I'm in the casket, you can't hear me. Girl, I'm going too. Cause it was always you.
