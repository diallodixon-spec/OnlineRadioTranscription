Don't get too excited. Oh, privacy. You ain't got to go nowhere, you can stay inside it Can you blow my mind? Set off my whole body If I give you my time Can you search my soul from it? I don't want to wait. Come take it. Take me where I ain't been before. Can you blow my mind? Set off my whole life.
