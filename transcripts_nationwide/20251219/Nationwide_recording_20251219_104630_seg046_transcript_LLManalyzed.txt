20251219 104630 about the glasses I'm wearing. They are for reading purposes. That's what the eye doctor told me. But some of you have been complaining about me touching the glasses. So here's what I have for you. For those of you who are in real life and can't see, I'm touching the glasses. I want you to get used to it. It just feels as if it's falling off my face. I can't help it. They adjusted it for my face. But every time I look down to look at something and look back up, it feels as it's falling off. That's why I'm doing it. So I'm touching it a lot now for you so you can get used to me doing it, right? So as soon as I can get that sorted, I will. I'm not certain how to do it on my own. I haven't tried, but let me see if I can get them to do it. But for now, please just be okay with me touching it. All right. So let me touch it a few more times for you so you can get comfortable with it. All right? We have Alrick on the line. Boss, Alrick, are you with us?
