I go jump like I never jump, wave like I never wave, wind like I never wind before, just to show you a summer, a summer. And I need you back in my life. You got people by the truck, emotions running high. We underpin the sky, tears running down we lie. Can't you tell that we saw it? We saw it, and we need you back in we lie. I need a gun back home. Come home to me, come home to me. Come on to me. I, I, it's time to bless the good. Come to me, come to me. Come to me.
