20251216 195644 Wanda Emerson, American philosopher and poet. And that's a reminder that some things only make sense after you have walked through them. Keep going. Every step is teaching you something priceless, wonderful words from the great Wanda Emerson American philosopher and poet and author of the bestseller, Pitch Your Wagon to a Star. That's our program for today. It was totally enjoyable. We really had great guests to converse with. Thank you, Mr. Producer, on today's show. Keep it up. Let's hope tomorrow we'll have even more interesting guests. That is possible. It helps now that we are coming to the end of a rather long year. My name is Keith Williams. Floyd Wright is the producer of this show. David Thomas, that very able technical man, was on the job again. That's the team that is inviting you, God's willing, to join us tomorrow at 6 p.m. with a real endeavor to present yet another edition of Power Play. Celine Dion, entertainer.
