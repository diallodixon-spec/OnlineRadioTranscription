And we're actually coming up with different ways of re-routing power. We're rebuilding the line. We're finding ways of getting power to you as best as possible. Just remember that we need to rebuild. In some cases, we literally need to rebuild. So we are coming at you as quickly as possible, as safely as possible. We do not want fatalities in the process. We're working. Every single day, we're bringing on more people onto the grid. Got you. Thank you so much, Winsome Callum, for speaking with us here. And thank you, Dr. Taylor. One love. Take care. Take care.
