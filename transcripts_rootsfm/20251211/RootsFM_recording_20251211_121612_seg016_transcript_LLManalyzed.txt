There is a sweet anointing in this way to play. There is a stillness in the atmosphere. Come and lay down. The world and truth have your eye on you. I tell you truly this poor widow put in more than all the rest. For those others have all made offerings from their surplus wealth, but she, from her poverty, has offered her whole life. The Gospel of Luke chapter 21 verse 1 to Paul.
