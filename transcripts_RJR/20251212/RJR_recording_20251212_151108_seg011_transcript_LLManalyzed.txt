20251212 151108 I am good thank you all right so we're actually bringing back tgs and we are fully reloaded tgs is our biggest sale event of the year and as you know because of melissa we had to cut it short but our customer kept asking us to wheel and come again so we listened so from december 12 13 and 14 tgs is back and it's bigger Than before I love it. It's TGIS Reloaded what can customers expect? Okay, so we started with the door buster this morning at 8 and on the 12 13 from 10 a.m. on December 14th, we have lots of deals. So you could get a TCL 43 Smart TV and that was this morning and that was only for 19,999.
