I made a million dollars and I spend it on girls But you don't wanna be high like me Never really know why like me You don't ever wanna step off that roller coaster and fall in love on me And you don't wanna ride the bus like this Never know who to trust like this You don't wanna be stuck up on that stairs Stuck up on that stairs singing Oh, I know What's that song What's that song You're got me, You've got me I'm so in love with you I'm in love with you, I'm in love I'm in love, ooh, ooh, ooh I'm in love You got me, ooh, ooh You got me, Ooh, ooh, ooh
