20251225 102013 When the cold wind blows and everybody get cold Just know the loving on your heart make you feel so good So good So good We should remember how blessed we are We don't need lights, we don't need snow If we've got the faith then we've got the hope And through the years we don't have to wait Because it's Christmas every day And when you're here the angels sing Let the love in your heart be the gift you bring Let's put a smile on someone's face now it's Christmas every day
