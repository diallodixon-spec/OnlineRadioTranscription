20251226 131811 I don't want a lot for Christmas. There is just one thing I need. And I don't care about the present underneath the Christmas tree. I don't need to mend my stocking, live the fireplace Santa Claus won't make me happy With a toy I don't miss today I just want you for my own More than you could ever know Make my wish come true All I want for Christmas is you. You, baby. Oh, I won't ask for much this Christmas. I won't even wish for snow.
