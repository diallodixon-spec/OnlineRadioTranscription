20260102 150102 Ready for the rum, ready for the action, come! This sweating spirit havin' me feelin' good! I have a linin' spirit Early in the mornin' I hat it Me cooler ready, me ice done ready Me punching that's automatic I have a lightning jumbie A kind of energy inside me And it ready for the rum Ready, ready for the rum, ready, ready, for the rum Ready for the action, a spiritual encounter In me soul faking over Telling me to start up the drinking And do away with good behaviour So let we go Let we go down the road Let we go It's action time, let we go It's bacchanal time Let we go Hands up!
