20251217 201914 Yeah baby, go on back your best Just who do you think you are? Stop acting like some kind of star Just who do think you are? Take it like a man, baby, if that's what you are Cause I'm moving on, love You're moving on now Moving on, love Nothing can stop me Moving Moving on up, you're moving on up. Moving on empty lives. Moving like a man. They brag a man has walked in space, but you can't even find my place. And there ain't nothing you can do. Because I'm handing over me, baby, being hollow.
