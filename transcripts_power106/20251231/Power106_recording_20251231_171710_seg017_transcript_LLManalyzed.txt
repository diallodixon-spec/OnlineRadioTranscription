20251231 171710 Welcome to the Auto World on Power 106 FM. I'm Shelen McLachlan. It's Wednesday, December 31st, 2025. And today we're talking cars as we put our nearest resolution inside. And this is for every car owner, the things that we can consider for 2026. So joining us for our discussion is none other than Mr. Roderick Biles, Managing Director of Jamaica Turbo Appearance Services Limited. Roderick? Hi, Shirley. Boy, I can't believe our last program for the year is New Year's Eve. Definitely, Shirley, definitely.
