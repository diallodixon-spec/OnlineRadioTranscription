I have the ideas like the Ethiopian Grand Renaissance Dam, which is the first mega project independently funded in Africa since its colonial era. It's the biggest thing and we haven't even talked about that. So that's where my mind even think about more time. I don't have that old image anymore africa is developing and it's a great continent oh god yeah yes yes it definitely is and one of our listeners georgia from dwayne park says how can we have food security if we even have to buy earth to grow them these days she says it's no longer the seeding it's even earth and pots. All soils is not about to grow them as well anymore. Everything is controlled. And that's so true, like everything is controlled. Even the seeds and the earth and the soil and everything, the pesticides, everything, you know, so much of it is controlled.
