20251230 200604 It's too many words I like you too I don't know about you, but I come here to fight. Come to play a match. I'm not leaving until I'm wet. Come to pay a match. I don't live my life with regrets, no. I come to jam on a bumper. Come to drink on a liquor Until my head gone and I'm miserable All down on the ground, I'm causing trouble Look how the security awash me, they don't know I'm out there And it's much of the place that I defect like a zombie, I don't wait
