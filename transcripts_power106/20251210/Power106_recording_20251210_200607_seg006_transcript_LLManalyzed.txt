So are there different types of thrombofibitis? Yes. As I said before, thromboflibitis can happen in any vein in your body. There are some conditions that it's associated with, as I said before, DVT. You could have, for example, so DVT is when a blood clot happens in a major vein, usually one in your legs, and this is a serious condition. It needs immediate treatment because, as I said before, it can lead to the development of pulmonary embolism, which is a life-threatening medical emergency. Now there's superficial thrombophlebitis and this happens in smaller veins in your arms or legs and they are rarely as severe as DVT.
