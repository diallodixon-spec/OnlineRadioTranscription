20251216 115844 Your great joy and your enduring love, as we draw from the wells of salvation, help us to change our ways of thinking and living, that we might better reflect your love, your will, and your way. By the power of your Holy Spirit, may we be empowered to speak your truth in a world that needs to hear some good news. Hear good news that brings hope, that lifts up the weak and humbles the powerful. Indeed, the valleys of life shall be exalted, the rough places plain and the crooked straight. Help us, O Lord, to truly embrace the real meaning of this season. Come to us, Lord Jesus. Come again. Amen.
