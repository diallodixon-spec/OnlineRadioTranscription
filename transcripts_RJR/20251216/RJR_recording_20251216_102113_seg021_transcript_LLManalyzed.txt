20251216 102113 We're very happy to partner with Trans Jamaica and we're very grateful to be given this opportunity to partner with them. So what we essentially do is we're trying to, we supply or we distribute lumber, zinc, zinc screws and other essential items for recovery to the people in this region. So Trans Jamaica, it's their initiative and we are the partners in the distribution and the provision of the materials. So just to give you an idea of the complexity, we have trailer loads coming in every two days. We have a team here that offloads and distributes to people. Trans Jamaica has close to about 2,500 people they're trying to assist in this region. So can you imagine the scale of what is involved? And logistically, sending a trailer load every other day, sits here, distributes off the trailer, it goes by. 2500 households. 2500 households, correct. Yes, so that actually translates into a couple more thousands, maybe about 7 to 8, almost 8. Easily, easily, absolutely. Directly affected. Directly affected, yeah.
