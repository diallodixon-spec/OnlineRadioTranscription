20251229 105223 What you got? Let me slip my corn inside your slot to hit the jackpot. Rev me up, rev me up, my little buttercup. We can tuck sheets, snuggle up, and get stuck. Believe it or not, here comes a brother with glow. A snugglin', bubblin', overweight, lovin', huggin' pro. So what are we gonna do with this? I like the way you wriggle, you don't jiggle but you jiggle. Jiggle, wriggle, but you love cause it's heavy in the middle. I'm moving like I'm moving, she one of the grooves so I groove though. But then she wanna learn so we play school and I schooled her. But not like this, we can pull some turns, rumble, tumble and twist. Anything you want I'll give it, fantasies will live it.
