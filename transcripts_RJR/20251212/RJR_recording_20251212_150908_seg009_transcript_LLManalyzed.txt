20251212 150908 I don't really care what people say I don't really watch what them want do Still I got to stick to my girls like glue And I might not play number two All I know this time is to skate in jail Need a lot of cheese up in my head I got a lot of densels All right, then. Well, all right then. Yo, yo, yo, yo. Be okay, gone again.
