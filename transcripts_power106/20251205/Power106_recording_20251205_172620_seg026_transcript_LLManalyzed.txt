============================================================

So I think we should expect strong performance from McLaren. There's always a possibility of safety cars and such, but we don't really race with the intention to have crashes or anything like that. We want to have good, clean racing right throughout. So I do believe that it is possible for McLaren to win. I don't know if it would be a one-two. The favorite this weekend is definitely the Londoners for the win. But anything can happen on the day, on the Sunday. But we'll know a lot more going into the qualifiers. So far, the two practice sessions have been somewhat of what I expected. Lando is leading Max Verstappen in the pre-session thus far. Oscar seems to have a little bit of a challenge here and there, but I do believe that we can expect a very strong performance from McLaren and we should expect a very spicy fight
