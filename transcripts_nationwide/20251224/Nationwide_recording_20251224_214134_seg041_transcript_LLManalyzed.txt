20251224 214134 So back to your mom now, what's the best advice your mom Jacqueline has given to you that you've carried over into your marriage? Whoa, geez, that's a good question, you know. That's a good question. Yeah, I think my mother is a Christian, you know, and she is big on God and my relationship with God. So yeah, she always remind me to put God first in, you know, in front of anything because, and you can't go wrong with that. Like the Bible literally say, seek ye first the kingdom of God and then everything else will be added on to you. It's not seek everything else and then God and then everything, no. See God first, everything falls into place after that. You don't have to figure out how it falls into place, it just will. You know what I mean?
