And I've said to the ministry team, we have to ensure that if somebody wants their animals to be tagged, despite the fact that it could have been done a long time ago, we have to get to them. Now we did 300 in St. Elizabeth, and they want to keep the blitzes going. They're coming to Manchester this week. The butchers made some suggestions about some of the places to go to tag, and also the butchers highlighted some of the challenges in the system, and some of the personal challenges, and we're going with that, right? So I want to assure the Butchers that we've heard you. I've sent to the team to make some changes. We will monitor it for another week and see what our numbers look like, and we will continue the dialogue. We want everybody to have a Merry Christmas, but we also want to stop people who are looking to benefit from the crisis by stealing animals. We cannot have that. Minister of Agriculture Floyd Green.
