So you're promoting a new single now, Old Girls. Tell us a little more about that. It's a roots reggae one drop. You can hear it because it doesn't really matter. It has that hardcore dance to it too. That's why I started DJing. Because I realized it has that hardcore, rubber dub style, DJing vibes. So I just said alright, singing and DJing. So I used up those two focas in the music. Alright, so right now I'm going to play the song, Zin. I'm gonna play for them here while I go on with Tuff Art, Old Girls, I mean with people. I want them to go on all of the media platforms, Apple Music, Spotify, YouTube, Stream, Tuff Art, everything.
