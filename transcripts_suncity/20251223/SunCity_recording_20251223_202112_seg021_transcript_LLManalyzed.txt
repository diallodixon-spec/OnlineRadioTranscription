20251223 202112 Come on! Merry Christmas! You can feel it from deep within. Feel it crawling from under your skin. It's something like a blessing, a blessing from above. So pure and clean and spotless like love. Oh, love isn't always easy to find. Don't wait your peace of mind. It will find you in due time. Time, oh, love, isn't always easy. Ooh, ooh.
