20251229 211409 I look into your eyes, girl what I see is paradise You captivated my soul, now everyday I want you more Now I cannot deny this feeling I'm feeling inside No what I cannot take your place I cannot take your space It's a fact I cannot erase You are the one that makes me smile Make me float like a boat upon the night Girl, you are my African queen A girl of my dreams You take me where I've never been. You make my heart tingle in line. You are my African queen. The girl of my dream, you remind me of a thing. And that is the African beauty.
