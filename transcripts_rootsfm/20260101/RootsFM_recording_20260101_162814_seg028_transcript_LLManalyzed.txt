20260101 162814 How long will you think you're not going to use the Gator Youth to do no criminal act? You know I said that must stop. Come in and take advantage and you get one. You know I'm not turning you back. Guess what? I want more shipment to come just alive. One more Gator Youth, one Gator Strive. One more vampire coming on the night in the form of a politician dressing a wife. with one more promise and one more life One more innocent get or you die One more youth in a coat we get dry And one more feel young and one more mad a cry True you know say that the roots have nothing Born in a papati fighting the struggle And out of life them a try make something And you take the promise and press the button Never too lucky to get back to a rich person
