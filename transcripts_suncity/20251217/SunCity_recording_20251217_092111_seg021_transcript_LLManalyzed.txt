It says when there was no king in Israel Every man did what was right in his own eyes. Just like today, people are living according to how they see fit and they do their own thing, not anticipating the judgment that's going to come. So what we're reading here in verse 10, Amos 8 verse 10, I will turn your feast into morning. So you're celebrating and enjoying. What comes to mind is when Noah was building the ark. Same thing, Noah was witnessing to them. They wasn't interested. They were getting married, enjoying themselves and doing all what they chose to do.
