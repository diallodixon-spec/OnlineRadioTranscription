Every time you make a diagnosis in medicine, it involves a proper history, a proper examination, the relevant investigations, and then you try to come up with a diagnosis. You must have a focused history because in this case, you must talk to the patient. If the patient is an athlete that is running all the time, like my patient who I spoke about when I first started, it was clear why his sodium and his potassium and his chloride was being deleted. He was sweating a lot, persistent sweating, because I see the athletes every day on the field and if they're not not only hydrating enough, George, but they are not replacing with electrolytes, they're going to have muscle cramps yes so electrolyte imbalance persistence sweating excessive exercise especially if it's high intensity activity is going to cause that so that is something that you must look into so you talk to the person you have to ask them about chronic illnesses
