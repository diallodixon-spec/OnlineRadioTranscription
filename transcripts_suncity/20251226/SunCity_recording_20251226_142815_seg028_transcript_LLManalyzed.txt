20251226 142815 And I see someone chosen. I never forget the code that I live by. My lesson at the road, them not give flight. Keep my eyes them open. Still fly when my wings them broken. Now if I could change, friend, I could turn. Link, I could pop, bridge off a bird. Girl, I could do what the **** and y'all could learn. Now, if I could throw you down, if you're in the firm, so. My belly hurt, the bird, I get the worm. Even when when I'm a ready dog, you have to stand up stand. How me you to eat is not a next man concern. Just know food I eat, your next plan confirmed. Now go tell the limo, me me know your head up high. Me feel a pain when you cry, you see them flaming on me hand. Until the day me die, me keep on raisin' it. Gotta bring the game back to the sky. I bring the sugar to me youth and tell them say me I the proof of living legend or deny. Yo, Josh.
