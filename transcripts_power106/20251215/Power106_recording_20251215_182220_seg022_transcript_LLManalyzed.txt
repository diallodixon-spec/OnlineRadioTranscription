20251215 182220 That's a superb feat. I don't even think some of the greatest male players have anything remotely close to that. She's extremely dominant for Manchester City though. She's the go-to striker and she knows how to tuck the ball in the back of the net so it's always going to be something like that but to see a 1.33 that's phenomenal. That's really phenomenal. That's something that I'm so proud of her for and I can't see her keeping up that strike rate for a long time. Because as she goes along, coaches will start to work her out. They will start to put a lot more pressure on her and stuff like that. But anything within a one or even a 0.8, 0.9 is a superb rate in this world.
