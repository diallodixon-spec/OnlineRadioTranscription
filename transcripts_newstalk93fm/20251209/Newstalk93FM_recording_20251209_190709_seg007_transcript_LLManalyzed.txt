My first love broke my heart for the first time and I was like Baby, baby, baby, oh Like baby, baby, baby No, like baby Baby, baby, oh Thought you'd always be mine Oh, for you I would've done whatever And I just can't believe we're together And I wanna play it cool But I'm losing you I'll buy you anything I'll buy you any ring And I'm in danger Ready, fix me And just shake me till you wake me from this bad dream I'm going down, down, down
