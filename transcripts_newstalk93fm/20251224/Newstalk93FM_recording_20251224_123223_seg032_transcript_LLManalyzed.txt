Feel complete, cause we love you back and now. Beat, beat, rumble beat, beat, beat, things so sweet, sweet, sweet Feel complete, cause we love you back and now Heat, heat, rum go beat, beat, beat, things so sweet Sweet, sweet, mm-hmm, well it must be cannibal Love the way that you bring a vibe We chance them up in the sky Rolling back and having a time
