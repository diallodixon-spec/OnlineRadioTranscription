20251215 104736 limited with volume leaders closed. Trans-American, highly Jamaican dollar shares closed at $4.81 up by one cent. Wicton Energy closed at $1.23, also up by one cent, and the QWI investments closed at two cents, like the first two, one plus one equals two, so QWI closed at two cents. So I reverse two, one plus one equals two. So QWI close to two cent. Okay. Basically that's about the roundup for Friday, December 12th, 2025. Okay. Thank you very much, Chris. All right, Jane, listen, have a great day. And again, my condolences to the Argera family and, and the needed family of, you know, Antoine Smith, the CEO of Argera Communications Group. Thanks again Chris. All right. That was Christopher Thomas, Senior Investment Advisor at the Oxford Road-based Mayberry Group Limited, giving us a round of developments in the local equities and bond markets on Friday. Stay vigilant.
