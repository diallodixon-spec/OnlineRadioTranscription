20251231 111811 I just lyrics in my chat and those words are true. Ease up, give me some space. Big man at the top trying to know your place. You don't see a violence, my dear baby. You don't want him, you want a man like me. Just hold it tight, you think I rest you every day and night, treat you right, you'll never need to fight. Don't deny what you feel inside. Someone I could be with all my life, he wants a girl on the side, I need to bow and fight. Girl ever go back. Baby, if you try my love.
