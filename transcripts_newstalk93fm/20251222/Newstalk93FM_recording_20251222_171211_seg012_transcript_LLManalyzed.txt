20251222 171211 So if I took it for granted You're not promised from today I go drunk like I never drunk Wait like I never went blind Like I never went before Just to show you I saw you I saw you And I need you back in my life You got people by the truck Emotions running high We underpin the sky Tears running down we eye Can't you tell that we saw you? We saw you And we need you back and we lie. I need back, I'm back home. Come to me, come home to me. Come home to me. I, I need time, not place to go. Come to me, come on to me Come on to me First time I touch the stage This make me feel alive
