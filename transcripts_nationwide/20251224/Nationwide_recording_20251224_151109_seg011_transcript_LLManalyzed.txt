20251224 151109 Yeah man, big up Uncle Mark. I get a nice little mascot from Uncle Mark man, like he's always gone above and beyond. You know, him farting at Kingston and him dropping off a Christmas gift somewhere, just to tell us that Uncle Mark, trust me man, like we appreciate you. We really and truly do, here on the show. Yeah man, so remember when Grand Market come, remember we don't miss out on Mark's Superstore, because Mark's Superstore have the good things there. So when we go get the good things there, if we're not getting like a last minute stuff for Christmas, I want to have a gift to buy on our show. If we go check Mark's Superstore, I'm going to show him something that he can buy. That is it. That is actual factual. What location did you go again? Lionel... Lionel Town? Portland Cottage. Portland Cottage in Clarendon and Lionel Town in Clarendone as well.
