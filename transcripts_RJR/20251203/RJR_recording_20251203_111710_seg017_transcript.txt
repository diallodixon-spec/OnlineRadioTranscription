============================================================

It is unimaginable how hard it is and will be for many fellow Jamaicans. And just as the physical rebuilding of parts of our country will take time, so will the emotional healing of our people. Be kind to yourself and others. Be gentle and stay safe. Together, we will get through this. A special message from Rated Jamaica 94 FM. As I raise my right hand and I take this oath to serve and protect, to serve and protect you.
