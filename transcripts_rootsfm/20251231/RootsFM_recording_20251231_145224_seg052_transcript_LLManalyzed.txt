20251231 145224 Tonight I gotta cut loose, footloose, keep those Sunday shoes. Please, Louise, pull me off of my knees. Jack, get back, come on before we crack. Lose, you're loose, everybody cut footloose. You're playing so cool. No playing ever. Take a way down in your heart. You're burning, you're burning the full song. Somebody to tell you, a life ain't a passing you by. I'm trying to tell you, I'm not afraid of passing you by. I'm tryin' to tell you, you will live, don't even try. You'll be mine if you don't come loose.
