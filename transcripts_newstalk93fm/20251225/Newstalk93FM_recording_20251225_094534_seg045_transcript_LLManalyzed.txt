20251225 094534 I don't want a lot for Christmas. There is just one thing I need. I don't care about the presents. I only need the Christmas tree. I don't need to end my stocking. We're upon the fireplace. Santa Claus won't make me happy. Oh All I want for Christmas is you. You, baby. Oh, I won't ask for much this Christmas. I won't even wish for snow. And I'm just gonna keep on waiting.
