20251226 193824 I love my culture and love where we from We get these powers from this same nation Sweet like steel drum, these sweetest vibrations Don't let the rhythm get you, just run, run, run If any of you could handle it, jammin' But like when the mat will hide We go rip it up for spite Oh lord, goodbyes and party, we love it Sweet, we havin' Greatest on the planet, boy Somebody radio loud playin' a song and it goes and I fuck And if I lose myself inside this place, well, I show my shit up Empty souls can't unblast when the beat just pass The madness runs up, just give it up
