20251230 185239 are committed to carrying out all the things that we need to carry out to ensure or to make it less likely for us to end up on those lists. So outside of whatever else might be in the news, which we are not able to comment on or speculate about, the work has been done. The prime contact secretariat at the BOJ and all other related bodies are taking this anti-money laundering content financing terrorism issue seriously and we have put in the work over the last five years or so at least since 2021 when the first national risk assessment was completed and it identified our risks and we put things in place to address those risks. Would you describe, if I could just follow up, would you describe our international financial reputation as strong? We would have to if the standard for determining that we were a money laundering risk was our placement on the list.
