20260101 160002 It's like having a dream where nobody has a heart It's like having it all and watching it fall apart But I would wait till the end Of time for you and do it again It's true Don't you know As I can't measure my love There's nothing to compare it to But I want you to know that if I could fly I'd pick you up, I'd take you into the night And show you love like you've never seen, I've ever seen
