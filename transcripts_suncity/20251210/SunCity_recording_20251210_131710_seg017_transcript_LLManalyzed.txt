============================================================

Here we go! so much tears, no time we not able to eat the alias. Still have how it was, and I can't just rest. I'm embarrassed and I say I take with two of these. Them get amazed, say them who da want change, we young with tears. Them took the liberty of how we come to erase. The one that dedicated to us was a slave, we act like them brave. Corruption dump Scars at the front of your cannon, you're still ablaze Them are giving you a bus, all the dummies at the base All them are listening to you, you hear the phrase Rastafari is a face, man suffer through the years Shed too much tears
