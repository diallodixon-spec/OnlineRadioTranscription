Because the lord is in the temple where everybody bow. Everybody bow before him. I need the radical praises. A blessing. Who blessing from the Lord is here. Holy, it's a blessing tonight. A blessing, from the Lord, is here. Tell them, I feel it in me. I feel it in the atmosphere. I bless His brother. I bless the brother, Lord is here. I bless the Brother, Lord, is here!
