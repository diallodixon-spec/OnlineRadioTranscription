============================================================

We haven't seen a down month since April low so it was natural for the market to experience some form of pullback about sentiment. Markets just won't move high on a straight line and of course naturally it would have been about AI because that has been the main driver of markets as well. Everybody's been concentrated. So you'll see that pullback, but now you see that everything's off-placed in the market, and I think that's quite healthy. It doesn't mean the bull market's over. Typically, you have a rate increase that would more or less kill the bull market. So spending is intact, but investors are cautious, because companies are borrowing to finance AI spending. So, from a market standpoint, you know, for a short week, by the way, we're getting some data, but I think that investors will be cautious, but they might very well stay in the market.
