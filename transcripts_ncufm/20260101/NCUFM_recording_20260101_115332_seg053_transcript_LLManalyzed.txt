20260101 115332 with you, dear God, knowing, Lord, that each plan, each idea, each circumstance that we may have in our hearts are not even our own liking, but, Lord, are the things that you have ordained for us and help us to be humble enough, to be submissive enough, to work along with you, their God, and the things that you have in store for us, maybe the things that will glorify and decorate our lives. Continue to strengthen us, dear Lord. Continue to keep us. And in this brand new day, O Lord, we lift our hands in praises, in worship unto you, our Lord, our God, and our Savior. Amen.
