20251217 192114 turn our backs upon the words. We have ignored it, yes, to our own peril, yes to our own destruction. And oftentimes when we are faced with the consequences of our actions, we turn to you and open our arms and cry out for help. You have been such a gracious God. because in those moments when you could have simply ignored us your mercy and your grace took care of us truly mercy rewrote our lives and today as we live to see another day it's not because of our wonderful behavior not because we are so sanctified and holy simply because your love your mercies and your grace I pray you continue to be with us
