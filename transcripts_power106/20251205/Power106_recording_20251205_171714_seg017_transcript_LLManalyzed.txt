This is to determine that the signs approved by the municipality are following the terms and conditions of approval. The audit covered Hagley Park, Eastwood Park Roads, as well as Washington Boulevard and sections of Halfway Tree. The city inspector warned that illegal billboards and signs will be removed during the campaign. The audit will extend to businesses operating in malls and plazas. He appealed to the operators to come in and formalize all of the billboards that have been erected. The issues of illegally mounted signs and delinquent advertisers have been a long-standing one, and media houses and car marts were among the latest groups to be identified as delinquents, according to the KCMC. In October, the KCMC said it was prepared to make public the name of advertising companies that owe the municipality millions for billboard advertisement across the municipality.
