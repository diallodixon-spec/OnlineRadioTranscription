20251216 182618 this is the piece that you cannot buy send me love that you cannot mix one is the joy that you cannot waste and the other one price that you cannot fix This is the peace that you cannot buy Find it a way where you cannot see Man with this cyst if he cannot breathe I need to find relief But behind my mind it runs All these thoughts are troubling Find it to give up, my baby Find it to be on lane My mind, running to the other side When it's time to leave my life, then it tries to take me out Tell you what I need, right yeah I really need, I really need money I really need I need a free mind
