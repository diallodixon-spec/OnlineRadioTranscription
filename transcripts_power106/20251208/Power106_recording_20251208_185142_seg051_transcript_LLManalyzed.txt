Very good evening to you, sir Rick. Pleasure to probably once again be with us here. Thanks so much. I appreciate it. It's great to be here again. Okay, great. Oh, by the way, Rick, where in the world are you at the minute? I am in Seattle. I was in route all day yesterday, got on a plane in San Juan and connected in Miami. I got home at 1 a.m. last night and hitting the ground running today, getting ready for February. Okay, I hope you enjoyed the long walk back home. Absolutely. Now then, there's something about the conversation, the way I look at what my producer has here. When we spoke, you sort of, when we spoke about the coach of the opposing team, the Puerto Rico team, sort of painted yourself as the underdog. This tells me that you felt you had to work harder.
