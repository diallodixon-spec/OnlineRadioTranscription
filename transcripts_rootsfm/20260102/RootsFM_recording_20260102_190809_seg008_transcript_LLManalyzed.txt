20260102 190809 I wanna take you home with me tonight I wanna come and warm your lonely nights I wanna be wrapped up baby in your arms And I'm holding you so tight I wanna rock you gently till you sleep I wanna be the man that's in your dreams I would be glad just to know that you feel the way I feel Don't ever lie So just hold me baby like I wanted to from the day that I met you Hold me baby, we'll die, fight as we will feel by the end
