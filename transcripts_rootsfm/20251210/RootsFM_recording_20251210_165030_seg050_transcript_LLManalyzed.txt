You don't love me no more Just going through the motions Oh, you're not being fair I've got my pride, I will not cry Still I can't help but care I'm not the kind of girl that you can let down. Don't let me down, don't let me down. Boy, I am only you. I'm only you. This girl needs more than a teacher. No, her sense of love, love, love found in you, too. Ooh, baby, talking to the corners of your mind I'll always be there for you Through good and bad times But I can't be with you for more than that
