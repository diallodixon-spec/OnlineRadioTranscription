20251216 201308 I caught you romancing in another manor It hurt me so much my whole life fell apart How could this be? You're cheating on me At first I was sad, but now I am glad Couldn't be the girl for me, na na na couldn't be the girl for me, na-na-na Couldn't be a girl for me Couldn't be a the girl for me Na-na-na, couldn't be a a girl for me Love may kill blind as a bat Now I can see I thought you were special The only girl for me You've been telling me lies with some foolish alibis Now I recognize the unfaithfulness in your eyes Couldn't be the girl for me
