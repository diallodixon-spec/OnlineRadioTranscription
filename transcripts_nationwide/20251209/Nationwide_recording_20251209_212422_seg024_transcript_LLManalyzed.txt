Hold on, watch how I'm going to mash up the reasoning now. Why is it that nine out of ten men would approach women the same way and it's inappropriate? Does it suggest that we have far more women who've made it the man them who needs to fix up them argument or is it the woman who needs to reject it? First of all, what they need to do is when they approach this way, they address it immediately because the moment they allow it, then they allow it. So far too many women.
