20251218 111513 I'm not for government running things, but I am for government dealing with infrastructure help. Precisely. So that's what they're saying. They need infrastructure and they need affordable capital. And I'll tell you why I say this, Ralston. If it's a Champagne region in France, it's in my hurricane. Mr. Macron down there, I plant back the grape. Right away, right away. If it is... California. California is the same. Whatever product you know. Gavin Newsom would be out there getting it done. Precisely. If it's sausage in Italy, they are going to jump on that because that is their brand and I know part of our reason is that we are dismissive of our own brands and success because of that Jamaica thing.
