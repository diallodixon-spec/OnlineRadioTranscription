20251216 202009 I'ma be fine. Nothing you could tell me that could make me change my mind. You don't care, you frighten me. Now, she or no gal, you won't hear to me. Make it clear, myself, to that you're here. No gal, you don't fear. Anything that you say, you know, hear. I'm moving on. I'm so far gone, I changed my number. So when you see me, do not speak, because I won't answer. Should've cherished me when I was yours. Now, I let you. No apologies. Get off, and these are a mess, bruh. Best you ever had. Best you'll ever have. It's Sun City, baby! We're watching! Sun City!
