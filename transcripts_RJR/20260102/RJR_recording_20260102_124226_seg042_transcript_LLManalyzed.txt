They also do that at my church and I'm saying that Miss Lucy didn't want to tell me the name of her church and to invite me to her church whether in person or online but I'm inviting her to my church so she can see the great work being done and that is Bethel Baptist Church in Halfway Tree, right Miss Lucy? So I hope to see you there on Sunday, a Sunday convenient to you or you can join online. This one says Mr. Earl tell Liz that she doesn't attend church and she don't know what the church does for the people. Blessings you Mr. Earl. The money is not taxpayers money.
