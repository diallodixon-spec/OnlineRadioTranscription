20251222 090807 If loving you is wrong, I don't want to be right. If being right means being without you, I'd rather live a wrong doing life. Your mom and daddy say it's a shame. It's a downright disgrace. But long as I got you by my side, I don't care what your people say. Your friends tell you it's no future in loving a married man. If I can't see you when I want, I'll see you when I can. If loving you is wrong, I don't want to be right. If loving you is right, I don't wanna be right. Am I wrong to fall so deeply in love with you?
