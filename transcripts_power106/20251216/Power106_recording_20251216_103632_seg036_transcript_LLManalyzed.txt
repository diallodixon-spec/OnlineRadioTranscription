20251216 103632 that a very good experience could you um now i'm saying we have tried that one before when when when when jps was won by the government it was extremely inefficient and we can't afford that in the world that we live in today like like a like a like a juice that kind of inefficient outages and blockages every day man and we're not we're not down that road yet in terms of the ownership. There's a whole lot of, there's a lack of clarity as to where we are going at this particular point in time. So we cannot say with any conviction that they are going to take it over yet based on what we have been hearing coming from the Minister of Finance and coming from the Energy Minister. But when the government had control of JPS, it was just outages and blockages. It can't work. Okay, okay, okay. So now, you know, like recovery, we're speaking of recovery, but you're saying you don't see...
