Jesus hasn't changed, no The same as yesterday As when He walked the shores But got up yesterday Still the healing Jesus Now and ever, evermore. What a healing Jesus, I found, I found in you. What a healing, Jesus, cause you restore, refresh and renew You're my healing Jesus For such a time exist Arise on healing
