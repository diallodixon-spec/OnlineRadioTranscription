the backflow. This is what the valves in our veins are like. So let's repeat so that our people can understand. We have our pump, which is like the pump for our water tank. We have the arteries, which are the pipes that are connected to this pump that will pump the water, in our case the blood, at high pressure. But on the return side, it's like a gravity feed pipe that is only depending on gravity to get the water around to the rest of the pipe or the rest of the house now if it is that it has to the pipe has no travel against gravity then the only way to prevent the water from backflowing is by having check valves or non-return valves. These prevent the water from going in the backward direction. And this is what happens in our veins. But not just any veins, in our deep veins, which are our larger veins. So we have these large valves that prevent the blood from flowing backwards.
