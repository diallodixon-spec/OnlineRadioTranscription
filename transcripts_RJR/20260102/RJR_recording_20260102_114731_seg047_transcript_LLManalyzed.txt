20260102 114731 assistance. Good morning, Andre. I thought I was dreaming when I heard the voice RGR is playing, but I went back to sleep because I am cold, but I realize you are sitting in on the hotline. First of all, I must say a prosperous New Year to everyone in Jamaica, including you. Thank you very much. The one thing I would like to see stop is bad mind. As we Jamaicans say, against one another. This leads to a lot of things going on. I agree with John. Too much corruption. But if they have the love for everyone, whether they are working in a department, doing construction work, etc. They would be honest with every single person they come in contact with. There are a lot of other things.
