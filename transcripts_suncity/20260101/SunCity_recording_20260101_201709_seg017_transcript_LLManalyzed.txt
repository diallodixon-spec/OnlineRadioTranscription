20260101 201709 It's like cities, baby. What's this? No! Why are you guys so slow? We'll never come in between You're part of my entity Here for infinity When the world has twice its part When the world has deserts caused If the hand is hard Together we'll mend your heart Secret When the sun shines, we'll shine together Told you I'll be here forever Said I'd always be your friend Took a note, I'ma stick it out till the end I've been screaming more than ever Know that we'll do have each other You can stand under my arm forever
