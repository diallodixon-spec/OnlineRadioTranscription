20251212 193730 On the 29th of November, sitting upstairs on the balcony and looking down at the parade ring, Radham could hardly have more impressed. But, he didn't find his feet in the early part of the race. Eventually, after being stolen into stride, lost by two lengths, dream to reality was the winner. Remember, Radham was disqualified from first for interference. So,, from causing interference and intimidation to one of his rivals, but would have beaten the rest without a doubt. So he's the top rated one here. Ricardo Carr should be claiming 9.1 pounds, not able to. So it will be 150 pounds, but I think Radham is rated enough to get the job done now then a breath of fresh air to be written by demar williams must be dangerous two lengths fourth in that same event where radham finished two lengths third last last time around
