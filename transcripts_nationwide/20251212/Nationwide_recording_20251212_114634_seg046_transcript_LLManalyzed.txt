2025-12-12 12:09:24 As a fitness guy, I was surprised by my chronic illness diagnosis. I thought working out hard I would fix it, but it wasn't enough. Now, my prescription meds are part of my routine. When I got my diagnosis, I really felt down and stopped spending time with the people I love. Then I decided not to let any disease get the best of me. And I'm committed to taking my meds as prescribed. On time, every time. No hesitation. Take up to three months to pay the remaining balance.
