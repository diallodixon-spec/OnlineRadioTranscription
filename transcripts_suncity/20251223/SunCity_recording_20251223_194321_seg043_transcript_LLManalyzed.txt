20251223 194321 Jamaica, we shall rise. We shall rise. Yes, we got hope as long as there is life. After the rain there be sunshine after the rain. There'll be joy after the pain. And children are hurting, blood run through them veins. Leaders make we unite and we build this again. Yes, we are one, out of many people.
