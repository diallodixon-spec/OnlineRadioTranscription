And I told you mine You were always there With a shoulder to lean on Anytime Now something's changed Nothing's the same, no, no You're here beside me And I see you in a different light Candlelight Moonlight See you in a different way Through different eyes And it's so nice I see you like I've never seen you before The way I want to see you much more Tonight, tonight
