20251217 173319 and bringing new perspectives to light. Every week, we'll be diving into conversations that are often kept quiet, but deserve to be heard. So today, we're starting off with a topic that is deeply relevant, yet sometimes considered taboo. We'll be talking about mental health today. And you know that this month is Men's Mental Awareness. And we are joined today by two wonderful guests. We are joined by Sonia Winter, who is the founder of Treehouse Therapy. She's a psychologist. And we are also joined by Rolando Alberts, who has offered to share his perspective on therapy and mental health and especially as a young man in the Jamaican thoroughfare. How do you navigate that? So I just want to say welcome to Roots 96.1 FM and welcome to Adjust the Truth, Dr. Winter and Rolando.
