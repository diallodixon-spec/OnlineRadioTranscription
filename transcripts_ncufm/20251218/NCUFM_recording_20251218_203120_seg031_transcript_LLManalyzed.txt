20251218 203120 ACP McKenzie says administrative personnel have been strategically deployed to locations across the island to increase patrols, we will conduct beats, we will ensure that the traffic across highways and within townships are moving in a very free, unobstructed and safe manner. The objective is to ensure public safety and order and facilitate a smooth flow of traffic. One of the things that we also have to do is increase our intersection management. Even though we have a number of intersections, that we have our junction boxes showing to people that they should not stop within the intersections. Inevitably, persons do that.
