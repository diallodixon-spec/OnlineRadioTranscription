20251215 112419 If you look at the map, it's not just mountains. There are areas where a circular road can be put around Kingston. Same thing for Spanish Town. You shouldn't have to come into Kingston, right, to go into Spanish Town. You should be able to have connections to the motorway that takes you to Angels and you just get yourself on the back slide into Spanish Town. it's tons and tons of traffic we have here is just just not making any sense and even my students in urban anthropology understands this more than the labor rights and comrades who run this country I just can't get it I can't see how we're in 2025 Greater Kingston right the Kingston metropolitan region right which is Spanish town Portmore and Kingston that entire region is literally 45% of the population of Jamaica how on earth you have no circle road for that entire zone
