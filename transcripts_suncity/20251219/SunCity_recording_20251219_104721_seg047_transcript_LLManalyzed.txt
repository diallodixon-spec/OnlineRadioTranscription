20251219 104721 Oh, my God. I'm going to go to Ethiopia and you don't have a plan The building of a nation and a helper on Every one a lover, one a man is just a man It shall be a coronation when we learn, learn, learn Who knows, who knows, who knows I just go with the trippin' dose Sendin' love to my friends and foes And I suppose I'm pleased to be chilling in the West Indies. To provide all my wants and needs. I got the sunshine, rivers, and trees. We live well. And I say we just move along.
