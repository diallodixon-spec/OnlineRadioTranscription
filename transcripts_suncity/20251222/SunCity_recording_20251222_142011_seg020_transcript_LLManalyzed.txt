20251222 142011 If I could touch your body Knowing that everybody Has a body like you But I gotta think twice Before I give my heart away I know all the games they play Because I play them too Oh but I need some time off from that emotion Time to pick my heart up off the floor And when that love comes down it I'll be motioned But it takes a strongman baby Thought I'm showing you the door But I gotta have faith, faith, faith I gotta have, I gotta have faith, faith, faith. I gotta have, I gotta have. I gotta have faith. Baby, baby.
