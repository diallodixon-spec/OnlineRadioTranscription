20251212 175735 What's its latest? I think right now I will say to you from a mobile network perspective, we're currently at somewhere around the region of about 88% of our sites. Sorry, let me give you the exact number. We have 84% of our sites back online, another 16% to go that we will get up before the end of the year, trying to get as many of them online before Christmas. I think from that perspective, we, when the hurricane had passed, we were somewhere in the region about, I'd say about 10% of work, 22% of our sites were online. So we've made big strides from that perspective and able to bring them back online. We've employed some additional technology in terms of partnering with Starlink. They're on some 250 of our sites. And as we get our fiber connectivity back up to those sites, Starlink becomes our backup from that perspective.
