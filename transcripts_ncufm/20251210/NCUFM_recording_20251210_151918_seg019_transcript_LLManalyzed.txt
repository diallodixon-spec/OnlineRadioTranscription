His voice makes the difference When he speaks, he relieves my troubled mind He's the only voice I hear that makes the difference And I'll follow one day at a time When I need Him, I know where to find Him In my constant prayer, His Spirit pours me And His voice just gives me my direction And I'll follow that voice that I hear His voice makes a difference
