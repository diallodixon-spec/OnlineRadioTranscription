============================================================

We were bad tonight and we have to accept that and take full responsibility. We weren't good enough tonight and credit to Cavalier to capitalise on it. We'll have to do better. I know we're not looking at excuses, but we have to do better, we have to give better performances, even just the attitude of playing and the will to do things. I think we were a little bit too negative were always confident of winning the always transitioning once we had the ball. It wasn't a surprise. We have been working hard and the team have been working hard over what we call a holiday break, but for us it wasn't a holiday break. It was just work, trying to perfect what we had planned.
