20251224 125839 And we are about to dock this ship. With another cruise complete, I must thank my second mate Abigail Bethion, the brilliant producer behind cruising, as well as the news, sports and current affairs team. Beloved cruisers, we are now at the end of another cruise. We have dropped the anchor and it's time to disembark. But do not despair, your life is much like a cruise. And whenever the rough seas affair, do not forget that the captain is in the boat with you. God bless and Godspeed until tomorrow.
