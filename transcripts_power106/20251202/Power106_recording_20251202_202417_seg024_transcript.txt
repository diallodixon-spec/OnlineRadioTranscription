If you just put your hand in mine We're gonna leave all our troubles behind We're gonna walk and don't look back Don't look back Now if your first love let you down There's something that can't be done Tell her what to do bruh Don't hear your faith and love Remembering what you've become Oh no So if you just close your eyes
