20251229 162212 I can see clearly now the rain is gone. I can see all obstacles in my way. Here is the rainbow I've been praying for. It's going to be bright, bright, bright sunshine in bed. It's gonna be bright, bright, right sunshine in bed. Red, red, red, red. Bright, bright, bright, sunshine in bed. Yeah, hey, it's gonna be a bright, bright, bright sunshiney day.
