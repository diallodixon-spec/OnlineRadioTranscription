20251222 204134 With my head to the ceiling See I'm drowning alone and I'm lost in my feelings Somebody send me a sign cause you know that I need it Can't even come back to me cause you know you're my healing. I said it's OK, it's my therapy. Therapy, my therapy. Can't take away all of my anxiety. Anxiety, my remedy. I tell you that we all need love.
