20251224 201915 We're happy tonight, walking in a winter wonderland. Gone away is the bluebird, here to stay is the new bird. He sings a love song as we go along, walking in winter wonderland. In the job and you're in town Later on, we'll conspire As we dream by the fire To face out of frame the plans that we've made Walking in winter wonderland
