I feel like if people don't know and they don't have the content, just tell them. If after you tell them now, they still come and come and come. Then you say, look here. I can't. I can't do anything else. Yeah, But people need to understand that. Listen, it's it's it's healthy. It's healthy when we see our politicians asking questions. Um and it's even better when they give responses to those questions. You know, when they respond to the question and not and not get offended by it. You it. That's when we as citizens, we get clarity, we get an understanding, and hopefully we can move on from that issue and pick up another one. That's all it is. Nothing wrong with that. Nothing at all. In fact, it's healthy. Of course.
