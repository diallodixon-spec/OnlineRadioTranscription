20251215 214327 Don't let me down Cause if it's love I wanna drown I need to hear it from your mouth Can't wait no longer, tell me now Don't mess this up, don't let me down Such a risk but I'm willing to take a chance What you think when my heart's innocent Gotta learn how to let someone in the hold Take time, gotta trust who I let control If you got me questioning what it means to me Used to be out of reach Feel like you're testing me, you're the necessity Full corporates on me Don't mess this up, don't let me down You know I wanna be around You tuggin' Warren with my heart, didn't think it'd ever be So how crazy I'm lettin' down my car Don't mess it up, don't lemme down Cause if it's love, I wanna drown
