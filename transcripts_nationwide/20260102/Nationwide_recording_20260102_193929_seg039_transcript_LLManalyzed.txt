20260102 193929 201 occurred in just the last decade. Of the 34 category 5 hurricanes recorded since 1960, 14 have occurred since 2015. And every year since then, Jamaica has been impacted by a weather or climate related event. Unseasonal rains, flooding, tropical storms, major hurricanes, and on the other extreme, severe drought and record-breaking heat. The climate is changing. Our oceans are warming. Weather events are becoming more frequent, more intense, and more destructive. A once-in-a-fifty-year event now seems to be happening every five years. No one expected Jamaica to be hit by Hurricane Berlin in 2024, and then Hurricane Melissa in 2025, but this is the new global reality. And climate is only one dimension of the uncertainty we face.
