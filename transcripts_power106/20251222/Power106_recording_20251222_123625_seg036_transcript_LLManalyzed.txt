20251222 123625 Oh, my baby Crying room, friends with tired eyes I'm hiding from you, and you're so devised My God, I thought you were someone to rely on Me, I guess I was a shoulder to cry on A face on a lover with a fire in his heart A man under cover, but you tore me apart Now I've found the real love, you'll never fool me again Last Christmas I gave you my heart But the very next day you gave it away
