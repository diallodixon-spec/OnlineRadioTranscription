When you're talking about a radio station, a good radio station, you're talking about Roots FM 96.1. You're listening to Roots 96.m. to 2 p.m. Sorry, sir, it never go to all week and we have food for thought. Your health is well, then love boss, love boss, that is a must. And a idiot, idiot, idiot thing that will close it off at the end of the week with Fire Friday, which are the talk of the street. Rootsology, missy, yeah, rootsology. Rootsology missy, it must gone.
