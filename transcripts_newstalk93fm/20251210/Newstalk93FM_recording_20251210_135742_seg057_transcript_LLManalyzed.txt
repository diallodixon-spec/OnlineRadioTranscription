============================================================

And I'm still smiling, smiling, smiling through the pain. I'll smile till I'm whole again. Yeah, it's gonna be Gonna be fine, gonna be fine. Gonna be, gonna be, gonna be fine, Gonna be fine, just shine on me. Always dark before the light. They will ever follow night, so I'll wait. Wait until the morning sun is a winding road. And nobody knows the pain you've known. Georgia alone will keep you slow.
