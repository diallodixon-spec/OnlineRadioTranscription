Somebody just saw me on the street, and I became an actor. And from there, somebody saw me in the movie, and that person was Chris Blackwell, because his girlfriend was in the movie. And Chris Blackwell is the person that took me to Jamaica. I met Jacob Miller, I met Bob Marley with him and his trip to Jamaica when I was 15 cannot change my life and gave me a lot of roots. All right, Remy. Remy, you're out of time here now, unfortunately. It's a time signal here. Thank you very much for taking the time to come and speak on the show. We certainly learned a lot from what you say, and we are going to be cooperating with you going forward. Thanks for being here, Remy Wanto. Yeah, man.
