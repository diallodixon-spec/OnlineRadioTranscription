I know you smell the perfume The makeup on his shirt You don't believe his stories You know that there are lines Bad as you are, you stick around And I just don't know why If I was your man Baby, if you Never worry about What I do I'd be coming home Back to you Every night Doin' you right You're the type of woman Deserve good things This full of diamonds A head full of rain Baby you're a star I just wanna show you you all You should let me love you Let me be the one to Give you everything you want and need Baby good love and protection Make me your selection Show you the way love's supposed to be Baby you should let me love you Love you, love you, love you
