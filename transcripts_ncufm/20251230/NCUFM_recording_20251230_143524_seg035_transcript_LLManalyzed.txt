20251230 143524 just online to when we have gone in several outings together as a radio family, as a drive time family. Literal drive time family meet and greet. And it was good to sit back and watch. We had a WhatsApp group that started going strong. And it was just good to see the drive time family growing. You know, recently I was online and I saw a young lady making a post about her family. And she was saying how glad she is that she has a family, a close knit family, a family where her mom and her dad, they love each other. Her dad is a very supportive dad. He's a young lady, so you know, she in relationships and you'd think this guy was the one and break up and she a ball and her father is there for her and she talking about the closeness of her family and her brothers and her sisters.
