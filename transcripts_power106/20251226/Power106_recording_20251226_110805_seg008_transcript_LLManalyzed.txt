20251226 110805 Could be much brighter than tomorrow And if you really try You'll find there's no need to cry And this place, you'll find There's no hurt or sorrow They are ways to get there If you're care enough for the living Make a better place Make a better place Heal the world Make it a better place For you and for me And the entire human race There are people dying if you care enough for the living So make a better place for you and for me
