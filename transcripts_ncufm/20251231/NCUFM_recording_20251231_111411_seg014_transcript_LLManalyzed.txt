20251231 111411 So your husband has been bitten by a poisonous albino mamba snake? Yes, doctor. I told him not to keep that snake in the house. Am I gonna die? I would estimate you have 15 minutes to live. The Bible says that everyone has a fatal disease called sin. But I have here a pill that is the only known antidote. I'll take it! You're saying this is the only way to save my husband? Yes, ma'am. There is no other way. It says the only cure is Jesus. That seems a little harsh. Take this pill or die. Dear, I'll take it. I think we should find a more open-minded doctor. Ma'am, it's the truth. Oh, you are so intolerant. This pill will save your husband's life. Dear, I will take it. No. I've read about narrow-minded doctors like this. They're just opinionated and stubborn. Some people reject the Bible's message as intolerant. But if something is true and will save your life, then it is the most compassionate thing someone can tell you. Have you allowed Jesus to pay for your sins?
