And whatever your persuasion, we wish you compliments of the season. A gift that we can all enjoy comes your way courtesy of the Kingston College Chapel Choir, who host a benefit concert of their own this Sunday to raise funds for restoration work at their sister school in St Anne. Tidings of comfort and joy is not only timely for a Jamaica traumatized by Hurricane Melissa, but part proceeds go to St. Hilda's, which suffered extensive damage during the storm. Tickets are available pre-sold at the Music Mart, KC Bookshop, round about J.A. Until then, I'm Joy Kelly with studio engineer Andre Sawyers. Walk Good.
