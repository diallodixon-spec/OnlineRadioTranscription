20251231 164331 I want to play with you in the sea I want a late night kiss forever Until the sky falls down over me So my love is beautiful, but it's not enough To satisfy emotions and are shared between us I wanted to love this cause enough to mean so much more It just intensifies my wants to have a love that endures We won't do Cause every time I close my eyes I think of you And And no matter what the season is, I still love you Moving from my heart, I wanna be with you Wherever you are, I will never think of you
