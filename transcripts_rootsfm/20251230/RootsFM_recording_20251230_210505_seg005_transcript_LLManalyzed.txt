20251230 210505 Yeah, I'm just being nice. So why should I be afraid of you? When you bleed just like I do? The more you try, the, all right, keep shining too So I've got no time for you Cause in my view, you wanna step in on my shoe You wish you never live alone, feel so damn confused So every day you wake your ache because you know you're fake And every step you take, I bring you closer to your grave
