presents a new place to find rest, a new Sanctuary. Join us for a 10-minute escape from the challenges of life and the cares of the world. Sanctuary, a soothing spiritual health check, starting at 12.15, only on Roots 96.1 FM. It's 30 minutes of emotions becoming words, embodied into performance through poetry. Her poets express themselves using the spoken word and be inspired by their process of thought. Byzen verse, with me Dion Davies.
