You're a registered nurse, as I said, you can earn good money, you can do overtime, you can work two jobs, you can do all kinds of things. But you just always, as I say, you just always seem to be looking to the next level. I'll repeat what I've been saying. It made me feel good about myself. So you went on to do the masters? Went on to do the master's. Went on to do your doctorate. That's right. And still, that still wasn't enough. Still not enough, I want to do more. Even now I feel like I need to do more. I went to UCC and I'm exploring classes. I want to do something. But you want, before I even come on to what you still have left to do, because you ended up, as we say, as the CEO of your own company, when did that become a goal and ambition for you? That I don't just want to work for people, I want to own an organization and have people work for me. When did that happen?
