============================================================

of Thee, from Thee, and through Thee. We are grateful for Thy Son, and for the sacrifices that He has made to bless all of our lives, we are grateful for this blessed season that we not only celebrate at this time, but throughout the year that we should also be able to put into our lives, and as we go forward to bless the lives of our brothers and sisters, we are grateful, Father, for the ability to worship Thee freely, and we thank Thee for these proceedings, for all those who have worked hard to make it come to pass, and we pray that, oh, blessed, that will be a success, that all things will be done to the honor and glory of Thy name. We're grateful for the several companies who are represented here, who will present themselves, and to express gratitude, and also to declare what they are doing to bless the lives of our Muslim sisters not only here in Jamaica but across the world as well. Again we thank thee and ask for thy spirit to be with us and for any other blessing those we stand in need of we humbly petition thee to grant them unto us.
