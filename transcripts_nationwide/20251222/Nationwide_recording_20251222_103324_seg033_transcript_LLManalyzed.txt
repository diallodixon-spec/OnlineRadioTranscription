From Vauxhall, they come to Excelsior and tell the management and the principals they want three terms to bring the trophy, come down to Mountain View, and the youth do it. Right now, I'm not saying I'm strong-taste, come at me here. The youth get enough fight, but the youth prevail. I'm proud of them because they grew up in a garrison too. They could have picked up any negative, and the youth turned to football. I hear them say in their last interview him say winning is a plus enough, but it's not all about winning these guys I'm gonna make sure say them academic match with them football skill and call for the national coach to look on toward play them too got to play them ready for national football this you have a system where I play with people in the seat from the voxel and I'm saying any big side see that you tell them are going to take him and see the excelsior team and them take him. Him is also a teacher you know. Roll him by emotion, rush to primary and me go through the system with him. Rush to primary. All the way just down a juke street. Go my excelsior, him is also a pass player.
