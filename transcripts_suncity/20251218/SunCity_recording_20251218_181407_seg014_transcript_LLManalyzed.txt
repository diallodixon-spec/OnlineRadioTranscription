20251218 181407 as a tertiary agency, we believe in the whole power of community. And with youth, we believe that for Jamaica to be better, we have to ensure that we provide these sorts of opportunities for our youth within our infrastructure. And as a result of that, what we've done, we have literally shaped our programming and our structures within our respective institutions across the length of this country that signals and puts at the forefront the sustainable development goals. And a big part of that is ensuring that we are giving youth the skill sets that will enable them to become world leaders. And a big parts of that is service to others. And especially especially as you referenced earlier what has happened with Melissa and we're literally seeing our students in our institutions and our partners going out and seeking to make a difference in their various spaces. You were going to say something else Mr Malcolm?
