============================================================

I don't wanna party away from my problems Me and the man, they must spend couple grand, yeah, they've hurt me too much So we move away from them, I'm free in my mind, I don't want no problem The mind is too red, right, so we can't understand them The vibes, it's right, so me know it or not them Free to my brain, me don't know where me go land when This is my anthem, yeah I wanna free my mind right now, I need to party, party party You can no break my mind right now, I'm feeling happy With just a rock and a move to the plus Flip up that slip in the heat of my zone Head that spin and high grade I run Yeah I hope when me reach strong Give me the win and the any and the rough We gon' party all night, every week, every day
