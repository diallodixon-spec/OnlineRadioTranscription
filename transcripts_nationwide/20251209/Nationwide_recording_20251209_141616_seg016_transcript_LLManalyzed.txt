============================================================

I just want somebody, body Treat me like somebody, body Won'teless like me We miss you on your side of the bed Still got your things here They stare at me like souvenirs Don't wanna let you off my head Just like the day that I met you The day I thought forever Said that you loved me But that'll last whenever It's cold outside Like when you walked out my life
