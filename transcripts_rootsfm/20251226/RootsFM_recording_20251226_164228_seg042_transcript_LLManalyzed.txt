20251226 164228 Dirty Gov, leave me alone. I know you don't want nuts of soul. Where you want with my Dirty Gov, leave me alone. I listen to all your songs, I know you don't want a soul. The one you turn the gun, the butterfly in your belly. And don't be the commie, show me no luck. But commie can't lose no body, me just want up your body.
