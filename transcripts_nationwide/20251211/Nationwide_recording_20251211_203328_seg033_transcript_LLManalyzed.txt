Yeah Even if it comes up externally, they will you know, they will at least the very least at least not be so quick to jump into it. Yes I'll give you an example both me and Otis have used this example recently the thing about this whole concept of foolishness like I Get mad and get mad and I say, this is foolishness. I don't want you to watch this foolishness. And like when he's watching, daddy, I'm not watching any foolishness. And I'm like, I'm hearing myself. But like, and like Otis says his daughter is like that as well. she's like foolishness foolishness daddy foolishness but it's important because they need to know this is stuff that daddy doesn't approve of and that and and even if it means that them end up informed upon themselves that is fine it's good but that leads me to a point
