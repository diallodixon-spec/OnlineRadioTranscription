20251223 143828 Young musicians tuning in now, we like to give them some, you know, practical steps because sometimes I meet a lot of people and they have the talent, you know. They have the talent, J-major skill, but they're not getting to where they need to go. What practical steps did you take to sharpen your skills, get noticed in the industry? Because to be a musician in Jamaica is extremely competitive. I would say to sharpen your skills definitely you need to practice. That's the first thing. When you get gigs, know the material, then experiment with the material. Create your own sound, your own feel with that material. And then finally you need to network. Don't just practice and stay in the corner, get out there, some shows, meet other musicians and get into some circles. So practicing is difficult.
