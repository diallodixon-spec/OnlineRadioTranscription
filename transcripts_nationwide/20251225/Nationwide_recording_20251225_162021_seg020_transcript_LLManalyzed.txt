20251225 162021 I love my car, I love my wife, I love my money and things But most of all, I love my Brownie But most of them thinkin' They ma plan and they ma con and they ma scheme Cause they mo a mush of me and me brownin' But all the women dem a spread and a fuck up on it My line ain't no listenin' And she know that she alone and me must come back home to her in the evening And me and her ain't service to us and me love her The most and me not hurt or feelin' So all the talk, dem a talk All the chat, dem a chat My line ain't live in the time Me love me, share me, love me, fight We don't stop crying
