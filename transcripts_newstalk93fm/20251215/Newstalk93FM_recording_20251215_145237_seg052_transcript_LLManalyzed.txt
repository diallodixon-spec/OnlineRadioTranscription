20251215 145237 I've seen many, but I still pick you just like a fruit tree. Look in my eyes, what do you see? I see happiness. Me and you are kickin' like Bruce Lee. Baby girl, me want you pray this. One day without your lovin' and the rascal get seasick. Not even Viva when me sick can heal it. Lovin' anchor you keep me safe. I'm not afraid of the ocean. I keep you warm and cosy, you be coming on me arms when the storm's approaching. So why panic, when all of us think like the titanic, the lighthouse we are where I fall in.
