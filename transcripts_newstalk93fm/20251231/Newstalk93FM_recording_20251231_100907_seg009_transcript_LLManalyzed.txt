20251231 100907 Yeah, I never met nobody like a you, boy. And in my heart, you are so gentle, but you still are. Baby, I love you when you make me, make me feel, yeah. But I don't want to be naive, don't want to regret. He doesn't last, won't let me down, he was like D-word. Before I let you in, I got to get to know you first. My love, love, can't just give you my love. Love right, then I'm under. Baby girl, I'm not going to fight. Take that, you're absolutely right. You're too precious to me to only love you for the rest of my life.
