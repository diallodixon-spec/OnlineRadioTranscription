Watch over me Every morning I kneel down and pray for my family Look I say, hear my shout out No bad company Could take away what ya give to me When I see negative energy I'll go the next way I'm bad-minded, don't know who sent you But I'll let you in, see me now Can't see me now, can't see me now NPS people I beg you please When you see me now, see me now Don't see me now NBS people, I beg you please When you see me, don't see me now Don't see me now My family must live on everything I have been benefit
