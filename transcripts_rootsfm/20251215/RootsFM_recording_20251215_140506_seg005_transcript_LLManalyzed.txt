20251215 140506 I give that smile each and every time because you are what you are, not what they want you to be. You are what you are. That's the way you're going to be. Only you can make those changes in your life. And I'm encouraging you to continue to be good and continue to be a part of this radio station, Roots, the unstoppable radio station. In the meantime, Sister Beverly, we say good afternoon to you. Sister Daphne, how you doing? Good afternoon to Sister Monica. Yeah, I saw Sister Monica last night. Good afternoon. Thank you so much for making it this radio station. You know, a bridge in Otaro that make a woolly panacea. And I don't understand what's wrong with him. But we're living up, and we're keeping it real, of course, all courtesy of the better station. Turn up your radio, because the Morgan heritage is on.
