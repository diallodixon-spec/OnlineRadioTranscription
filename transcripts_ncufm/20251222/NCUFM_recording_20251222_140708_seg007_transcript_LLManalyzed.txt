20251222 140708 Good afternoon, Mr. chauffeur driver, Matthew J. Wright. How are you this afternoon? Give God all the praise, all the glory and thanks. Good afternoon, my drive time families. Welcome to another Motion Monday on the Drive with our chauffeur, mister Matej, right? So, let us just relax and have a wonderful afternoon on the drive. Blessings everyone. I smile, I know God is working so I smile Even though I've been here for a while I smile, smile It's so hard to live out when you've been down Sure we hate to see you give up now You look so much better when you smile
