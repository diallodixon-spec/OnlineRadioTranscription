20260101 145142 My life is filled with laughter This is truly happily ever after Like a story, or a movie With the credits starring you and me And nobody could ever separate me from my heart No matter what them try, they can't tear us apart We connected like the internet Maybe none of us be different You're my faith You bring so much joy to my world Tell me I'm your favorite girl Ever since we met, baby told me for running around looks like you cool me down you cool me down girl and time is a wasting whenever you're not around look like you cool me
