Ten panchuk has been there within the last 48 hours, two days between yesterday and today we have about eight to ten panchuk. These guys are doing the restoration work in terms of the JPS recovery that leads the current from Greenwood come up through Goodwill, current is at Goodwill, so they are coming through Bell Steel, coming down from Dumfries and leads towards the pump station over in Dumfries in Canaan. These workers are about a mile and quarter from the pump station. They have been working hours, long hours. They have been putting in sufficient work. I was there with them about one hour today just to speak to them to get a general feedback on how they do the work and stuff like that. So they are on the right path coming towards the water pump station.
