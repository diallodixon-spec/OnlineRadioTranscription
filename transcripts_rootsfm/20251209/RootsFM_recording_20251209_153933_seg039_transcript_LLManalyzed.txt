Now I'm so mad But that's the way to love That's how I feel in my heart I've got to say Oh, how I suffer Oh, how I tried I gave up my pride Just to be by her side And whoosoever tried To lay the love that's mine I never say no other word, no other word Oh, oh, oh, oh. Oh, ho, ho, oh, ho. Oh, oh, ho, ho.
