Ask all your questions, yes, I really mean it I spy, I spy that you see something in my life Won't come over if you feel it Ask all your questions yes I really mean it And I know just what you need And when the love of your heart starts revealing I for sure won't let that go I'm sick of me never really plan to look you But to hold me see you move you get me hooked, hooked me That nigga tell him to let me cook you After that he won't let me go I spy, I spy that you see something in my life Won't you come over if you really feel it
