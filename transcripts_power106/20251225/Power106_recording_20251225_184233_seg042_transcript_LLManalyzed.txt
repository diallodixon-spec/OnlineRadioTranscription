20251225 184233 Such a lonely, it's a lonely time of year Your presence surrounds me, it's all I could ask for You are the love that gives life to the fallen leaves There are no gifts that I could give to wrap you in my arms So together, life forever We'll be safe and warm with friends and family around We We ride out the storm together If you're not here with me in December There'll be no going back
