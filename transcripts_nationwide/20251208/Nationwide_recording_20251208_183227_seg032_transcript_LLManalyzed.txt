Let me clear up some some misinformation. It's not Cory himself who made the decision. According to Richard Cory this decision was made by a group. It was a council meeting and they made the decision and he's just making the announcement. So there's also that. Yes, it's not a one-person decision. He may be the chief but according to him it was a council that came to the decision as opposed to him by himself No, these are government resources dentists Walters says it's the military or nothing Classic Queen beta says the government should go and support the people. All right What's we have here? No, if you don't want a JDF, he doesn't get no materials. It says Josephine we don't have time for that battle right now. Let the people get the help says health is wealth let the JDF help them says Glenroy Clayton there we go folks there we go all right that was a good pub up today I enjoyed it hopefully you did too that's public opinion
