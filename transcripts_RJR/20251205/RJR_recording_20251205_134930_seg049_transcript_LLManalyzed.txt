I was just telling a friend of mine, we were at the launch for Fight Nights from Real Nephew last night. And I was saying to the team from JBA, the Jamaica Boxing Association, we need to really work on getting our boxers back at the Olympics because we need to be there. We can't have a bobsleigh team and we don't have boxers representing at the Olympics I mean come on man so they're working hard on it and I'm hoping that we can definitely get that done because trust me man boxing boxing is something Jamaicans we have to be there to representing man big time all right I think it's coming up on the time for your birthdays mmm so let me get to it right now you know hold on
