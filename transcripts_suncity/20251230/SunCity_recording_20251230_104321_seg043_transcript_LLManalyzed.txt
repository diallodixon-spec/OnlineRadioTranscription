20251230 104321 Never let you go, never let me down Oh, it's been a hell of a ride Driving the edge of my life Never let you go Never let me down Don't you give up, no no no I won't give up no no no Let me love you, let me love you Yo, Chris, study. So beautiful, selling a dream Smoking mirrors keep us waiting on a miracle, on a miracle So don't do the darkest of days, having to heartbreak away Never let you go, never let me down Oh it's been a hell of a day
