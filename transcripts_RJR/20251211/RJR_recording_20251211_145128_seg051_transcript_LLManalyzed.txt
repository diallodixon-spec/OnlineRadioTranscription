So there's a level for everybody. There is. Listen, Jamaicans love eating up. So when they say food, we eat that, you know. Right. What's what's been the biggest discovery for you guys at the Perry Perry Grill? I think it's just how the customers have have like reacted to having something new or um introduce them. Yeah. I think us as Jamaicans, we're very like stuck in our ways. You know, we're traditional. Yeah, we're very traditional. So for them to react the way they do, that they really love it. So that feels really good. Tell me what folks can get today on the ground right here in Kingston. Thank you. If you come to Sagicore Bank right now, we have our Rice Bowl, which is our best seller, as well as our Special of the Month, which is our Mary Perry's Chicken Slider. It's all here. Then they taste good? Then bad. They all make a new one if it tastes good. We'll get you samples. No, we have to arrest. I'm on air, I'm on air. I said it live. It's about getting some samples. Arrest.
