But my son can't say you come first. Because we big, bad, and heavy. Any son test with tonight, they're gonna bury. Watch this, we big, bad and heavy. So go and feed the nine niggas. Go on, feed the whole thing. My son a murder, a jumpin' in ya. Wicked every time. With a classic dancer style, drivin' everybody wild. We don't lotion.
