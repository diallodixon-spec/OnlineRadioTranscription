20251219 191012 That's it for this week's Tourism Roundup. I'm Andre Palmer with studio engineer Andre Soyas. One Play and we are in the Friday edition for the 19th of December and what else do you think? We are at the National Stadium, Excelsior and Jamaica College in a real old-fashioned stare down. Who will blink first? We shall see. Mill Hall, as they move into the second half, early in the second half. We shall see what happens. Westing is, of course, 202 for two, believe it or not, at lunch. All right, on day three. All right, we shall see.
