20251215 161208 Feel my trust, Lord. I'll back it up, Lord. Come and catch this thirsty of my soul. Bread of heaven, feed me till I want some more. Feel my trust. Fill it up and pack it up, back it up, Chucko and the blessing Jesus, now pack it up. Pack it up, Pack it up, back It up, pack It up. Blessing to a big figure boy in a cup, Chuck. We'll go back up the double-end loader. Take it off for the 18 wheeler. Can the blessing of the Lord help me make me rich? Add no sorrow, make me feel sweeter. Blessing me life with the healing of disaster. Starting from the cup and the saucer. Don't let the cup overflow, the blessing start both feet are down.
