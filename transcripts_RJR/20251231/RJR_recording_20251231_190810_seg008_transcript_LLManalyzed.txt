20251231 190810 and my leadership. Tell me about the festivals you've founded and what those are about. So when I walked into City Hall in 2016, I wanted to do a show called Yard and the Lawn. I saw where the community was going. I knocked on doors and I saw who answered those doors. And lots of them were not white Jewish people. Lots of them were not Hispanics. Lots of them are from jamaica and so i asked my colleagues eight years ago uh... can we do the show they shut it down uh... but eight years later here we are doing yard on the lawn headlining with morgan heritage uh... grammy award-winning artist and the city said uh... to me let's do this, but maybe a thousand, two thousand people will come. Eight thousand people showed up. Wow. Eight thousand showed up. That's a ringing endorsement. And more people would have come, except that the city stopped busing people in.
