Lord, I pray. I honor your name. Deliver your mercy. Whenever I fall, you lift me up. Glory to me. Oh, God. All-powerful omnipotent. Shine down your a magnificent When you build a fence it make all the difference Step in on me life and take precedence Be the captain, the pilot, the teacher Be the head and the boss and the leader Be my guide
