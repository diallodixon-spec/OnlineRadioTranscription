What do you know? Well, sometimes with the music but even before that I remembered in about late 2023 I had applied to take the LSAT and at the time, but I think they still do it now too, they gave me the option of either taking it remotely, so I'd be able to do it from the confines of my home, or I could travel to a testing center. Now me, so my time, me kind of prefer fruit quality. Me a say, boy, me nah go spend the money on travel, go here, so I go this way, me not know. So if I can sit behind my computer and take the exam, I will. Now, at the time, I never knew that my webcam wasn't in order. I think something wasn't working with it. And I decided, hey, let me see if I can take it remotely. So the day prior to the exam, I decided to take it remotely.
