people. It helps me be grateful. So I think, aside from being able to help other people when you volunteer, I think there's some personal benefits as well. Big time. Yeah, for sure. Yeah, that's pretty much it. Okay. Do you have any social media handles that you want to give on the air? Yeah, I think the simplest one that we try to upload a video to at least once a month is Reclaiming the Way. So it's a YouTube channel that goes into a little bit more of the preaching side of what we believe. But yeah, if anyone is on YouTube or Instagram, just search out Reclaiming the Way and they can find us there. Great. Thank you so much, Joseph and Alicia. Thank you. Thank you for, you know, tapping into mustard seed communities and our children with your Circle Hour. Thank you
