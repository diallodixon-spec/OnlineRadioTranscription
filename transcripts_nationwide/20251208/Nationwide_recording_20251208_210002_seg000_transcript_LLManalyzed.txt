I don't even know what you're worth Everywhere you go, they stop and stare Cause you're better than chose From your head to your toes, out of control Baby you know If I was your man, baby you Never worry about what I do I'd be coming home, back to you Every night, doing you right You look like a woman, deserves good things Fist for the diamond, a handful of rings Baby you're a Ooh, baby, good luck Touch your moon, make me your salvation Show you the way love suppose to be This is for y'all. Remix. Somebody's gonna celebrate tonight Somewhere I know One thing's for sure I'm gonna put on my dancing shoes Then I'ma hit the door
