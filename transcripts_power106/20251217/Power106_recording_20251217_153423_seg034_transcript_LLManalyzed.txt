20251217 153423 a reason of a doubt that's what justice demands yeah so whoever controls this narrative that's another story that's another um but what i'm saying sir is is is that it appears to me yes that the news media requires the hungry belly people of Jamaica, the illiterate people of Jamaica to mourn and lament the killing of people by the police. Not people is the wrong word. Gunmen is the right word. Because if I walk out a road, I don't expect the police to kill me. I do not. I mean the character want to, but I do not expect them to kill me.
