20251231 205232 No food to eat, no money to spend Nothing to borrow, no lend Every soul, I go in the prisons, boom, boom Them toys and we buy play-a-pen We send them to school to learn up the rules And none of we will use them, no one fool, fool Some of us are patrons rockin' and singin' along as you look forward to 2026, you know what I mean? Higgs and Twins!
