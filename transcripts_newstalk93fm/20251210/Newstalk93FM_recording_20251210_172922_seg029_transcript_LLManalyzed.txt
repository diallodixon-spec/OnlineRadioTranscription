And I get away So tell me, what do you want tonight? Cause I wanna take a ride Let me blow your mind Right here from the passenger side It's like that joke I got the sweet and the spice And the everything nice I got the hen and the lime With the cream on the side I hate it when you have to leave But I don't say a thing Cause I will absolutely get the ring No worries, no worries, no worries Baby, baby, baby, baby I'm gonna use my expertise I'ma keep it nice Imma keep it neat Imma keep it sugar Imma keep it sweet Imma keep it nice, nice, neat, neat Sugar, sugar, sweet, sweet I hope that you don't mind I'm gonna take my time
