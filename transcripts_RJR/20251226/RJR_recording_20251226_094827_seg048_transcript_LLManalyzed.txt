20251226 094827 I want to say good morning to Mama Connie and the Austin family, all courtesy of Elaine, who is all the way over in New Jersey. Good morning to you, Elaine. Thanks for tuning in to the 94 as we rock your world on a Friday. In the morning time, taking it to you. So we want to reach out to the people in Corville Gardens as well.
