Ajay, you can count my grave. I just say my lane, my lane. Me no get the time for the hate and the bad energy. Cause my mind on my money. Make you dance like Pocari. Steady green like broccoli. Steady on my grind, don't hear what they want. Telling me could be not my fantasy. Don't want to check if my tapping do wrong. But see, they rush. See, they rush.
