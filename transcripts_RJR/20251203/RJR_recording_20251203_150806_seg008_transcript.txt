============================================================

I never wanted to see things your way. I had to go astray. Oh, why was I such a fool to let you away? Now I see that the grass is greener. Is it too late for me to cry my way home? How could I be so wrong I'll take the weight. You were the one who left me neglected. Apology not accepted, admit to the broken heart you've collected.
