So on the next step, training and consulting, our hurricane relief efforts is coined the Bounce Forward Initiative because this is not about just bouncing back. I like that. I love that. Bounce forward. Right. Because if we're bouncing back, we're going back to the inefficient system. We're going back to a system that we're not ready to respond in a resilient manner. We don't want to go back there. We want to leverage all the goodness that is coming out of a disaster. And here comes another term that I love. It's called antifragility. It's when out of a bad thing, you create something good and you become better because the bad thing had happened. If that bad thing never happened, you wouldn't become so good, right? So it's almost like, I always say I'm like a mad scientist. When something bad happened, I'm like, there's some goodness to juice out of this thing. I'm looking for it. So which is why I said we are bouncing forward. So I was able to partner with Carla Dunbar Ministries, and we went down with 400.
