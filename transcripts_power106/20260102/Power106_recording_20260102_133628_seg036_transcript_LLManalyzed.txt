20260102 133628 dedicated to finding resources, food, money, send their children to school, things like that. They don't have the time to do it. The diaspora needs to go beyond sending remittances and barrels and start really seriously taking these things up. Else, if tomorrow, the yellow hair or the orange hair man, however you want to describe him, comes out and announce that at 3 o'clock in the morning, announce that Jamaica is a part of the transshipment of drugs and fentanyl or whatever else there is, and you decide to start deporting Jamaicans, we are going back to the same Jamaica that we left to become economic refugees somewhere else. I don't think there's another country in the world that has so much economic refugees all over the planet.
