the storm clouds. I don't know. I was really excited. I thought that you guys were going to pull off Sting this year. For me, you know, last year, obviously, Sting got canceled, postponed, as they would have said last year. Postponed, Which is crazy. Which we said on the air that this is a cancellation. Obviously. Right. So, we had said, no, this is a cancellation but they were adamant that it was a postponement. Um and now, this here. It doesn't sound like the lulu to me. It it it it here's the thing. Here's the thing. It is okay to take a break, right? And I feel like, you know, sometimes you really have to regroup and you really just have to just you know sit down and decide logistically, sonically, visually what you want your brand to look feel like you know moving forward so maybe they're taking a break from it.
