20251218 101413 So you're from the Ministry of Health? Tell me what is this you're giving me. You're putting in my hand quickly. What is your name? Willie. Willie, what is it you're giving me? You're talking about main mosquito breeding site. What is this? All right, so this is the flyer to indicate where the mosquito would be breeding, like in jump tins, tires, or containers in and around the homes. So you are encouraging people to walk around and empty containers? Not necessarily like that, but once you have the breeding sites in your home, you should, you know, just take care of them and treat the problem where it's necessary. All right. Thank you, Willie. He's one of the members of the Ministry of Health team. They're going to be giving out the chlorine tablets and just a lot happening. You'll get a chance to see that soon. I'm coming up on a break. We're going to be having an interview and then go back out in the yard here in Grange.
