members and the people who are hearing this it must be shocking to them well i mean there has to be a logical explanation as to why well none was given to the PAC i know what i'm saying people are so distressed and this is additional distress i know but i i cannot i really cannot um i can't think of a reason as to why that particular anomaly would have existed. Now it is... And it's not money is the reason, it's not a money problem, it's a competence problem. And I'm saying to you, them level of incompetence, they do not inspire confidence in a massive rehabilitation program like this that we have to carry out? Not at all. I think the minister has a very competent team. But that competent team was on display at the PAC and they never showed that they were competent so I don't know what you're saying. Well you know something is alright.
