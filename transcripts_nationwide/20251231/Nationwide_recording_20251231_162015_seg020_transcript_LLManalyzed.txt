20251231 162015 Mama say it's my fault, it's my fault I wear my heart on my sleeve I don't know how you get down with them clowns but I'm a soldier No one could understand I had way too much aggression That built over the years from my abandoned adolescence I see y'all done been locked up, backstabbed and heartbroken I wanted to grab but I was too afraid to open, freeing And one day I find a piece of mind by the ocean I spent all my time convenient, get closer While at my nana house I play the couch staring at the ceiling Trying not to get in my feelings Thinking of a way I can make these millions Maybe that'll take this pain away And clear up all these rainy days
