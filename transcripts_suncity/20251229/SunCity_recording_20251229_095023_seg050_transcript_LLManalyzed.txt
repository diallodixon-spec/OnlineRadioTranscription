20251229 095023 You know, for those who think they know about Jojo, for those that think they know how bad Jojo can get, ramp with my family. Say anything outside, sideways, out of your mouth about my family. You don't even have to touch them. Say something and then you'll understand. So it's weird when you see stuff like this where persons are experiencing their family going against them or plotting against them or talking ill with strangers or chatting them with people and, you know, or talk down to them without no support or, you know, not give them the support and not stand behind them. Yeah, man, it's weird to see. It's weird to get even a letter like this because I don't know what that is. I can't... I've never had that experience. Yeah. But it's sad. But my girls stay away from people who don't have your back. That's all I can say. Cosby Express Taxi Services, just stay far from them because they will set you up on any life. I don't mean to tell you Cosby.
