So I began all day to like talk, animals they inhuman form, bad demand nobody like work, but you must hustle if you want job, you know finish them on fighters, if them they run them no fee catch up, I know they from say I too righteous, no they from say you too like us Me no get the time for the hate and the power of the energy Cause my mind don't mind money Me, make you dance like Boccolini Steady green like broccoli Steady on my grind, oh yeah but they won't tell me me good enough
