============================================================

I'm afraid to close my eyes. It's another sleepless night. Oh, the shiver, the shiver. The shiver, baby. I'm on a dark disorder. I need you, baby. The remedy is you, girl. Don't you know, don't you know? I feel a shiver. I'm feeling down and out. I'm a true believer. I know what it's all all about I know it's not the flu It's all because of you I feel a trembling when I wake Come back and give another beret I feel a shiver
