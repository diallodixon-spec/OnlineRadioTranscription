20251224 185439 All right, I expect them to win it. Two clear goals, 3-1, 2-0, will do that. Now then, moving on now to Burnley. All right. Burnley will be at Terp Moore, and Everton will be away from their newly minted Hildickens Stadium to do batting. This one could be close. In fact, I don't anticipate a lot of goals in this one. I think that Burnley may be able to defend home side here and come away with a victory or at least avoid defeat. So I'm expecting Burnley to get something out of this. Maybe even a win. 2-1 wouldel. Now here is the match of the round. Saturday at 12.30 p.m. the only game that will be on screen will be Chelsea at Stamford Bridge.
