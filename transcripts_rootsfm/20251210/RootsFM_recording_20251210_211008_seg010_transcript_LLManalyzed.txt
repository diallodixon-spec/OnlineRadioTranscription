Hold on to romance, don't let it slide There's a special kind of magic in the air When you find another heart that needs to share Let me put my arms around you, this was meant to be And I'm also glad I found you, need you every day Gotta have your love around me baby, always stay Cause I can't go back to living without you Spending every dime to keep you talking on the line That's how it was And all those walks together Out in any kind of weather
