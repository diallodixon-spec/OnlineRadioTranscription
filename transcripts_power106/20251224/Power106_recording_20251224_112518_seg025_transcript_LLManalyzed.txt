20251224 112518 For the massive trade deficit that's from Jackson Jackson And I Have to admit when when I go to the supermarket even before Melissa There are certain onions that are brought in red onions and big white onions. I Don't buy them. I buy local onion. I buy everything I can buy local and sometimes it costs a little more and I know everybody can do that but fair enough but having having known Jamaica where we know grow onion potato and see us growing those things I am I am very pleased and that finally we're doing it so take up my money and buy something come from Spain or wherever and I mean just to cement that for the first eight months the food and consumer goods import bill was 1.4 billion US dollars and we only exported 47 million in agriculture. Stop it! 47 million!
