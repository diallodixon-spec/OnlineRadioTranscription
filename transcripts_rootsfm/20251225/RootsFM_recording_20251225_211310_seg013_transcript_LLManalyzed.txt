20251225 211310 I know that you're a blessing in my sight. Can't wait to hug you up and go to all your heights. Runnin' lemonade on a sunny day while the skies are blue. Love the holidays, wanna run away on an island with you. The only gift I'd like is you on Christmas night. I don't want an icy Christmas I've had enough The only answer I want to see must be in my cup And I don't want a nice Christmas I can't adjust
