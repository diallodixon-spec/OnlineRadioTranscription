I'll make it so you never leave Can you walk with me? Not stopping me? Can you take it to the top of me? I just wanna love you baby Always thinking of you baby Can you roll with me? Holding over me Can you take a picture with me? Always thinking and loving you baby See I don't know if I can handle you as just a friend Oh baby I can't pretend Oh baby I'm so far away But I don't mind as long as I could have you in my life Oh baby I'm satisfied Even if you're not just mine Can you take me to the top of me? I just wanna love you baby Always thinking of you Can you go with me? Hold on over me Can you take control of me? Always thinking of you
