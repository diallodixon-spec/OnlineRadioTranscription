2025-12-12 13:03:32 Because you ain't here I can't feel it in the air My cold sweat drippin' everywhere I'm all I don't even care as long as the love I keep playing in my day I forget what everyone said, I want it I couldn't care less as long as you Don't give your truth to beat us And I'll apply it from bliss to pleasure If you're open-minded, then it's treason And I decide before I swing And if you choose, then you can bet Every single dollar and your last few cents that I will too And I mean it, tell me where do we go from here
