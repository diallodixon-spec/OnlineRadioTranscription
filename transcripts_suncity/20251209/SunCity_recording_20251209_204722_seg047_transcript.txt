The time I realize Love me I feel the time I realize Different hate, different plain source We they are capable The **** about we push, life change course Make a freeze, ice a drip, we are the raincoat Like police in a plainclothes Tell them you say you're rich, girl, how we try? Me no see no ****, don't feel high Me brother never gonna leave, finna whip ya And tell them son, I will leave, but let me die Time I realize Love me, I feel the time I'm. I'm. The time of a life, the time of a life Don't be afraid to die A big beast, just don't pull up Bad man pull up Flat pantomime Tell a batman to jump up I don't see a Louis now, what do you know?
