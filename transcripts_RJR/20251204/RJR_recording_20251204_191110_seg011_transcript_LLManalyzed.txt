mats hard and then people they were sitting on up the front bright and can do mats and the rest so we just you know we're just there we struggle we're struggling we're struggling make up fail or you know barely pass or whatever so again when you start a class or when you start a year do you have to try to you know disabuse children of that they have to try to say to them look man you can do this. So I remember as you mentioned the news just now I remember walking to a class one time and it was the first day of school and I'm going over there and I walk over there and I said raise your hand if you like Max and they raise their hand and do do do raise and I said no problem let's get the news on the school if you don't like Max you know what going to happen? I'm going to have some special little gifts for you. When I finish giving you these gifts, you're going to fall in love with math.
