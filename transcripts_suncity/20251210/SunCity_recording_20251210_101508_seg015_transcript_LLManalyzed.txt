posture ourselves for it first. We have to be mentally prepared and ready for it first. The flaws that we have that, you know, maybe the person who we were with before never liked about us, maybe some flaws that caused us our relationships. We should really look into those things about ourselves too and not pin the blame always on just one person. But think about those things that that person would complain about and try to work on them. Do an assessment and try to see how best you can fix certain flaws that you know can or may affect your future. Just always try to be the best version of yourself or a better version of yourself. be way better than who you were yesterday and pretty much that's that and go for it give it a shot again okay all right we're gonna play the song again and for our listeners to hear okay
