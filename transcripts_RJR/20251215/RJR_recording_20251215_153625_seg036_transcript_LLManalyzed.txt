You did mention some of the you know, the Damascus all the problems that you went through But tell me what healing looked like for you as you as you you're going through this Difficult all these difficult times. Yes. So first of all healing is not instant That's one of the things I've come to learn but it's me Identifying where the root of the problem is so that God can deal with the fruit of the problem and I started to just Acknowledging some of the things are the areas where I was going wrong and where I could do better so I could see better results and Jesus really helped with that too so healing begin when I started to facing the truth the truth that listen I can take a different direction I can do better
