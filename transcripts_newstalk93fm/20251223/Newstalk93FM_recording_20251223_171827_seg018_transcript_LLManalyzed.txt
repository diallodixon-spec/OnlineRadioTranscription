20251223 171827 Did you check on me? Now did you look for me? I walked in the room eyes are red and I don't smoke banga Did you check on, did you check on me, now did you notice me? Nobody will know the paranoia Cause I put a smile on my face A facade you can never face And if you don't know me well, hello You won't see how buried I am inside my grave Inside my grave I've been drinking more, oh for the past five days, did you check on me?
