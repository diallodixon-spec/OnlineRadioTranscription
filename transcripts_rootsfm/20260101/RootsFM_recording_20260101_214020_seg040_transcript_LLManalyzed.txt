20260101 214020 I bet you start meeting me, sometimes you see me with someone else, somebody other than you And I know that it hurts when you know that it hurts your heart, but you found the rest of me On the other side, I bet you start loving me, sometimes I start loving someone else, somebody better than you So I'm supposed to believe that S.P.E.L.I.D.E. is calling you I'm supposed believe that they're asking you if you're home I want more yesterday Now I need you Can't get that over me Now I need you I love you but I won't be a fool for you Now it's just something that I wouldn't do, babe I mean I would stay if you could tell the truth But you can't, no matter how much time I ask Is that your bitch over there? Giving me the ugliest shit? The one with the similar cool ass? And the Brazilian dick?
