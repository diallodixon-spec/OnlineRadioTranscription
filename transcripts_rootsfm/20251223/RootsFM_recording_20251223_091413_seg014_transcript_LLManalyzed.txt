20251223 091413 I don't know if you know it or not Give thanks in the wake of blessing us afloat by me Give thanks me I like it if blessing us Afloat by me I guess you ain't got a chance to get to you Never let them stalk you, no likes that you Shackle and book and we can't figure out you The end of the year in my heart and you search you can't move Worry about struggle, we link you but the key Still over come, we still boy the two line me find me grassroot. Them wave they don't reel that look like baboons. They ponny line up here fi half moon. Me call no way a sheen. I must go back through. The house no one clean. I help a pass through. Me talk up. I reach like one goon. Me people write song and talk. Me talk true. Me live ponies. In a daily and night. Me male or white.
