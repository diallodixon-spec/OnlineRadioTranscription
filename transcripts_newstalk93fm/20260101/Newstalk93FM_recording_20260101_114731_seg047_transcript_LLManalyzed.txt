He ain't gotta worry about you coming back home Cause you done found what you been looking for all along Just a little bit of vibin' stick Now you on Florida time Now you so round and thick Slim waist, pretty face, you Florida pine So you ain't gotta pay for drinks no more Cause I done found what I've been looking for all along. I'm talking about when it rang everything. Oh niggas, where the babe? As I take name to my love language. Let them say what they say. They're about to be like all the p*** that they can map it in a club. I'm talking bout swimming in measurements. You can get a damn fitting in the back of my truck for me. Don't take your love for me. Clearly you need a club for me.
