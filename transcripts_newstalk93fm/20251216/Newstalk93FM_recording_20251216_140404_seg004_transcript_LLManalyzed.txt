20251216 140404 We're not feeling under the weather You just make me feel sweet Ice the cocoa tea, use the sugar And together we are complete, darling Heat me up Only you alone can put fire back in my soul Heat me up And they're telling me I shouldn't leave that fire alone Well, the more they tell me is the more I'm holding you close I could never let you go.
