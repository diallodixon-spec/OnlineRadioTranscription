20260102 105222 I'm such that fine for you, I ain't do that three more times again, I testify for you, I swear to like you, that b**** I do it all and I'm around, you're scared to do, I'm not, as long as you joking that we're in for me, I ain't got it, it's my miss, give me a clue in, I ain't your body, as long as you don't get no infamy. I ain't got it. I'm just dreaming about me, ain't no problem. I don't got nobody just with you right now. Tell the truth, I look better under you. I can't lose when I'm with you. How can us lose? And Mr. Mommy, you're just too important. I'm biting the body like you do. I can't lose when I'm with you. I can just snooze.
