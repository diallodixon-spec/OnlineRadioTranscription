A date for next year. Wanting me to preach at NCO Church. I'm not so much an Aboriginal, friends. We'll see how it goes. But when I get some more information, I'll share some more about that with you, alright? Who knows, maybe you will come. And come in person, come take in the sermon, I don also here with us. Rose from Kingston 8, good afternoon to you. Maureen Thomas Baker, good to have you locked in and to Sharon welcome on board sending shout outs and greetings to the drive time family right across the world and let me say a special good afternoon to Chellian. Chellian is in her seat comfortable, in her seat buckled in and ready for the drive. Family and friends welcome on board the drive
