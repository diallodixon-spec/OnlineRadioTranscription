20251216 211809 Take me to your island, some of my', where the sun not high, the sky, the ocean blue, so beautiful. We wanna be in the beach in your arms, say the word and we go. We wanna listen, yeah. We make love too, we make love too. We wanna listen to you. No one above you, no one above you. Be whining all night long. Baby, this your song.
