20251222 132824 Ooh, love me please Just a little bit longer Together we can make it Our love is much too young to break it Love me please, just a little bit harder Together we can make, our love is much too young to break it All I ever wanted Was to have you to myself And I see you standing there In the arms of someone else You know a girl can stand so much And it's more than I could beg I can't let you go Ooh, every time I look at you I still can feel it glow Let it be, let it go
