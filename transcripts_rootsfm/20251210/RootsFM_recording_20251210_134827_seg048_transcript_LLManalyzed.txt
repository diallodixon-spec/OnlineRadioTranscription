Must be so stabilized for me. I'm a neighbor. I like a neighbor. You're driving through Keystone. Who do you listen to? Lucifer, 9 to 6.1. The way you smile, the way you retire, the way you take care of yourself. In every way you make my day, you know I want you for myself. I see it in your eyes that it's me. It's all of me. Can I love you?
