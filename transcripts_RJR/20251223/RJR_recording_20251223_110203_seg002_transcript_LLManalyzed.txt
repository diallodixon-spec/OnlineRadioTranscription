The police are urging road users to cooperate and follow traffic instructions as efforts continue to maintain order and safety throughout the festive period. Motorists and other road users in Moran Basin Thomas say they are fed up with the poor condition of the town's main roads. They have accused the National Works Agency of neglecting the area. Despite repeated appeals for repairs ahead of a festive season, residents say nothing has been done, leaving them to contend with pothole riddled roads. They told Radio Jamaica News that East Street, the town's main thoroughfare, is badly scoured while Murray Avenue near Rosemary Lane is also in a deplorable state. Residents say the problem goes beyond damaged road surfaces, pointing to poor drainage, particularly in the vicinity of the old Morant Bay Arcade, where water reportedly pools.
