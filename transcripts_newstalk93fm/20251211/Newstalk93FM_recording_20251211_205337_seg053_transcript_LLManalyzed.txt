2025-12-12 15:06:53 In life In life Like royalty, royalty If I ever make it in a life I used to sleep and curry coach them and they never left me out Me used to live at Eddie's house Me never keep me own a key She keep me used to let me out Me bring him with me go L.A. It's like a hymn get nominated He watch the grammy side of me Cause how much people can you say?
