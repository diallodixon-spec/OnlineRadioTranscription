20260101 214839 I know you just have to wait Just trust in the good times Now love, love, love Don't call me easy But I keep on waiting Anticipating for that soft voice Talk to me at night For some tender arms Warm me up tight I keep waiting Till I feel But it ain't easy Love don't come easy Do you know it ain't easy? My mama said You can't hurry love No you just have to wait She said love don't come easy Let's a game of Atlantic You can't hurry love You know you just had to wait She said Love don't come easy
