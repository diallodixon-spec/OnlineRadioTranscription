The matter, which stemmed from a mob killing in January 2012, has been called up for is that the Manchester Circuit Court is unable to accommodate the seven accused due to inadequate dock space. Relatives of the accused men as well as defence lawyers are frustrated with the protracted delay and are now crying out for justice while the lives of the accused men remain in limbo. To add to the frustration is the fact that the accused men have been forced to report on condition of bail once weekly since 2012. Attorney Oswest Sena Smith is among the defence team.
