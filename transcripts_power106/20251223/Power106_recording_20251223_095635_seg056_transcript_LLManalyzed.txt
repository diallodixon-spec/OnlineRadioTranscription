20251223 095635 Atlantic Hardware and Plumbing is another such company. We spoke about this company that it would have been doing well after the storm. We can remember it was going for 85 cents or 90 cents prior to the hurricane, and thereafter, we see where the price is right now, closing at $1.54 yesterday. When you look at that, you're talking about after the hurricane, about 85% appreciation there. So they're not withstanding the market is in a bear's mood. There are stocks which are doing very well and customers are looking on whether investors are taking note and taking particular position in these stocks. All right so that's about the roundup for Monday December 22 to 25. Thank you very much Chris have a great day.
