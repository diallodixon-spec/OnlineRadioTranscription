20251217 212418 Baby, I'm sorry, sorry for breaking your heart And I'm thankful to you I know I've been wrong but I'm sorry When yesterday is gone You keep reliving that moment But you found out the truth Yesterday you forgave me But today you say we are true Oh, what can I do? Baby, I'm sorry, sorry for breaking your heart. And I'm faking it to you. I know I've done wrong, but I'm sorry.
