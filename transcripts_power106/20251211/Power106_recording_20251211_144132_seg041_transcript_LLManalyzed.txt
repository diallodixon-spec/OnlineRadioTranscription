Kitty up, kitty up, kitty up Let's go, let's look at the show We're riding in a wonderland of snow Kitty up, kitty, up, kitty up It's grand, just holdin' your hand We're gliding along with the song of the wintery fairyland Our cheeks are nice, airy, and comfy, coldy, are we? We're snuggled up together like two birds of a color, we're free. Let's take the road before us and sing a chorus or two. Come on, it's lovely weather for us. Lay right together with you. There's a birthday party at the war play. It'll be the perfect ending of a war play. We'll be singing the songs we love to sing without a single stop At the fireplace while we watch the chasers pop There's a happy feeling nothing in the world can buy When they pass around
