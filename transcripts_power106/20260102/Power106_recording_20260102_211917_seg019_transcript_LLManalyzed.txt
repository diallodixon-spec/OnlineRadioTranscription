20260102 211917 My God. I'm the worst one, Trader. And the people that surround me Wanna love me with a scorn, yeah Blue mighty that will carry me on Like a poor lonely man In the lonely little shack, yeah Where I have much food to eat, yeah And much pleasure to play with on his back But I'll work and sleep almost every day Work until the next free day Even if he can't come, I'm just a sport Ain't that the last I've heard you want more, love? Mmm
