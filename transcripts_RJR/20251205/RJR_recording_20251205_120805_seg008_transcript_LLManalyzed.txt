The National Water Commission says there are rising incidents of illegal water connections and deliberate valve tampering that are crippling the water supply to Alligator Pond in Manchester. The NWC says field teams have confirmed that on scrupulous individuals, some suspected to be farmers, have been inserting foam and other materials into distribution valves to block regular flow and artificially increase upstream pressure for irrigation and domestic purposes. One of the illegal acts was discovered in the community of Dove House. The NWC said these reckless actions are not only unlawful, but are severely undermining the ability of households, schools, businesses and essential services to receive their rightful supply. The Commission says the situation is both unacceptable and troubling, as many communities are still working to access reliable water supply
