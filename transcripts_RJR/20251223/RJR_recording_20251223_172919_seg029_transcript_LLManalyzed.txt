20251223 172919 If there's a place where folks do have food need, especially in emergency situations, our teams are more often than not there, especially if local support needs a unifying force like World Central Kitchens. All right, let me ask you all to hold on, please, for just a moment. Let's just take a break, do a little bit of business. Also, we're having an echo on Mr. Bela's line. Can we see if we can sort that out in the break? We're talking to representatives of the World Central Kitchen about the work they do around the world and what they've been doing right here in Jamaica. Remember our WhatsApp line. It's 876-254-0693. Give us your first name and your general location will soon come.
