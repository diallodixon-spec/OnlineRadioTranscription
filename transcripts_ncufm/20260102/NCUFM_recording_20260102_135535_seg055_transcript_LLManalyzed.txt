20260102 135535 on December 13 and 14. Present a mere month after his head- wasn't enough. So the time after Melissa, after setting up the roof, I went ahead and started to put in some work. Glass half full, right? After the hurricane, life continues. So it makes no sense that you sit around and wait for things to happen. You have to get up and do things. You have to change the narrative on your own. You have to create the opportunities for you. That's why I didn't want to miss photos. I just want to make sure I'm here. Just represent who I am and to come here and see if I can bring back some cash back home. You heard the man. So what about you?
