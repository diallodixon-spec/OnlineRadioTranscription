20260101 201612 We'll go to here and play a tango I'd better hear some blues or funky also There's only one sure way to get me to go Stop playing old time rock'n'roll Call me a rat, call me what you will Say I'm old fashioned, say I'm over the hill Today's music ain't got the same soul I like that old ton of rock and roll Still like it
