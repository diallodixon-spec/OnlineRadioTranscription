The experience will focus on good music, a relaxed atmosphere and opportunities for socializing leading up to the fireworks. It's one of the best events where the whole family can attend. If you can, definitely that. So can't wait to see you on the other side, new info, same old antics. And remember, if you got comments, send an email to radio at jris.jove.jm, connect with us on X at JIS News. You can follow us on the Gram and TikTok at JIS Voice and interact with us on Facebook at Jamaica Information Service. So until next year, I'm Twyla, no antics just fine. And I'm Vaan, Wollipa Antics, reminding you that knowledge is power, so stay in the know!
