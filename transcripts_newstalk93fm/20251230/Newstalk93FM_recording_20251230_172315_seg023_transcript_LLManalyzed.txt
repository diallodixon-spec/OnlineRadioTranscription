20251230 172315 Hello? Hello? I hope you're good, I hope you're well, I hope you live. I miss your touch, I miss your smell, I miss your lips. Maybe grab a drink, maybe grab some food, don't miss you I know it's hard, but no, I don't have no glass I have to protect my heart I built the wall so tall, I couldn't look over I need to touch you, I need to see you I'll take you one by five, I on the wireless. And though you said not to call you, you will miss you. And I hope I can see you one more time. You will miss you.
