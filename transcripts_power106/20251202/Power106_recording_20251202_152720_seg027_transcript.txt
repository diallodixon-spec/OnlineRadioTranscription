We have to remind them about the bridge you have to cross here over in the West Area. David's Seal, Azalea, Robert's Seal. You know the amount of millions of dollars of agricultural things spoil up over there because it can't come across the river. It's the most expensive thing. Everything that comes from over there is number one. The scale is number one. Time is number one. Vegetables are number one. Coffee is number one. And the next one, if you go to Penn Line where we start and take up the material and things, we're going to add this gap and pay them so I'm going to release the money there. We want them, you know, those people need them bridges and the roads to come down, they can't get to come over because I'm going to warm them and release the money already. So I don't want to say we'll take a cold bridge.
