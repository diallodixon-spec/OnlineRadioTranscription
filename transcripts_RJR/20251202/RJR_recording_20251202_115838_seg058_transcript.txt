============================================================

courage for our fears, success for our failures, and confidence in our future. Give us peace for our turmoil, joy for our sorrows, strength for our weaknesses, and wisdom for our confusions. Help us today, O Lord, to find faith for our doubts, forgiveness for our sins, love for our hates. May the weary find rest and the strong be renewed. We know, O Lord, that you are more than sufficient to meet our needs. And so we beseech you to be present for us today and always. In your loving name we ask it. Amen.
