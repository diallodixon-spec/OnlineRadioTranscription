20251225 194127 to the laughter that fills our yards, to the simple acts of checking on a neighbor, Christmas brings out the best in us. It's a time when we gather with loved ones and friends to celebrate the gift of salvation and hope through the birth of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. Christmas is also a time to embrace the spirit of generosity and compassion and to extend a helping hand to those who are facing challenges. This is particularly true this year as our country continues to bear the effects of the devastating hurricane that hit our island on the 28th October. I know many families are not celebrating in the way they had hoped for. Some are struggling to rebuild their homes and their lives. Some are still without the full restoration of the basic services that we often take for granted. Some are dealing with loss and grief. We must keep each of you close in our thoughts and our prayers.
