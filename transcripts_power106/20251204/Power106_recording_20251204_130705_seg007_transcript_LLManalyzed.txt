There was no information from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs or indeed from the Prime Minister. Now let me explain something to you because maybe we're not all together sure as to what happens in other countries that we like to mimic and so on. If the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom is going away on official business, there is a full itinerary of what that business involved, who he's meeting, where the media can come, et cetera. Right? All right. Let's say we don't have a tradition of following ministers when they go abroad, because most media hosts too broke. If the president is going to Europe, they don't just say, hey, President Donald Trump gone to Europe on official business, and you don't get to know anything about it.
