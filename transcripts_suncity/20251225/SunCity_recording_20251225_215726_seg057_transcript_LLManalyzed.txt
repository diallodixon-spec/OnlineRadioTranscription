20251225 215726 Baby don't go Baby don't go It's such a shame but I'm leaving Can't take the way you're mistreating me And it's crazy but oh baby It don't matter whatever don't phase me I don't believe you want to leave like this. I don't believe I just had my last real kiss. I do believe we'll laugh and reminisce. Wait a minute, you'll be fine, right? All my pride is all I have Pride is what you had, baby girl, I'm what you have
