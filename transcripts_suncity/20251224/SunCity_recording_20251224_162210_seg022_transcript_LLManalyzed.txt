20251224 162210 A lot of people sing for the night. A couple of hours. One dance can do. I'm telling you. It's really something I've looked into in the other parts because I've been to these Souls events and everything and they play all the Souls that you can think about for the night and everything. And it's true, you don't get a Lovers Rock segment there and I think it's missing an important part because trust me, if you bubble to an alternate party and you catch your groove on a Jan Wolt and all of them, it feels good too. So they need to include that segment. I agree with you. I agree. Nothing wrong with that. You don't have to overdo it. Include it. Nothing wrong with it at all, man. So the boss has spoken, people. Include a Love Us Rock segment, man. And it's not because he's bias towards the reggae but you know even even or great late mama be come on I first have a mommy and love a story I should come please just a teen yes don't even love us rock this morning that's true that's true
