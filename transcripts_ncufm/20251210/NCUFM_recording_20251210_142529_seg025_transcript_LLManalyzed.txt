============================================================

Have a broken heart Where do you turn? Where do you turn When your life and dreams are broken You can turn to God With him you'll overcome Yes, you can turn to God What do you do When your life is torn apart Tell me, what do you do? Yes, you can. When every door you push just won't open You can turn to God With Him you'll overcome The devil lets me to die But God kept me for today
