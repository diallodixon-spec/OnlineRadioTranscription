20251224 124921 I've learned to love me more than anyone else. And I will never be the same again. Making boundaries. I'm making boundaries. Walls so thick that you won't climb. Lying so long that you can't find my heart Will never be something for anyone to trample on again Gotta protect me to the end Live my life with no regrets Blow the past I don't forget All the lessons who I am, no Making boundaries
