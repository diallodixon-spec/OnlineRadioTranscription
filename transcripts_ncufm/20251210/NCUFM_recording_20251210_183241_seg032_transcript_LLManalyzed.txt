============================================================

powerful angels to go out to spread the good news of salvation that Jesus saves. Hear our prayers as we come before you. Let our prayers come up before you as sweet smelling incense. May your name be glorified and may your people be blessed. In Jesus' name I pray and for Christ's sake. Amen, amen, amen. Hi Jordan. Hope you had a wonderful day today. I can't believe it's Wednesday already. It was like we were in studio just yesterday and we are back again this evening. Time is definitely going. Let me use this opportunity to say good evening to our radio friends and to welcome you to Prayer Power Connection, your online prayer connectivity to the throne of grace. We are live on NCU Radio 91.
