2025-12-12 07:34:08 A little time A little time to look around me I've got nowhere left to hide It looks like love has finally found me In my life There's been heartache and pain I don't know if I can face it again. I can't stop now. I've traveled so far to change this lonely life. I want to know what love is. I want you to show me. I want to feel what love is.
