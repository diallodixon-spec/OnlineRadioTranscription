20260101 150706 Climbing by the thousand, burning by the thousand Me mother didn't buy me a green or did a sneaker She never know she buy legacy, I never know either All I know I see is super blue, climbing on a stake And tell all me little friend and them, I want to repeat that The opportunity come up and me a little fly pass A colored flavor road, Maturita road and the bypass When we was different you learn, this was only dry grass Peaks pull out a white flag, I start to wave it like a Thousand rock, thousand flag Thousand Hey, hey! Hey! Hey! thousand, rag by the thousand, towel by the thousand, people running by the thousand, whining by the thousand, climbing by the thousand, should I see the thousand? Thousand, how much on in the year? Thousand, whoo whoo, how much rag in the year? thousand, how much flag in the year?
