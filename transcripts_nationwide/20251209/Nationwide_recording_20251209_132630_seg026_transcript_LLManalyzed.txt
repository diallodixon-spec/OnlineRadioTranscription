I can let it all pass me by I can get down and try And work it all out this lifetime Work it all up, it's time, time, time There was a time when love wasn't chosen Now I'm just open for more Now I'm just reaching out for something better than I had before That ain't about to mind your world Ooh, now I can let my life pass me by, I can get down and try Work it all out this lifetime, work it all out this time
