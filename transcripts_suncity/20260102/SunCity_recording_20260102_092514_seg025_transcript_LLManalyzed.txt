20260102 092514 of anxiety, people who are afraid of traveling alone, nobody's never available, other factors why I would recommend group trips. The first group trip I did was to Thailand in 2019 and it had over 30 people and majority of them were meeting for the first time and up to this day they're still friends traveling together, booking other trips because it creates long-term friendships too. So yeah, those are some of the benefits I can name as it relates to group travel. Yes, that's nice. I like that. And it's a very nice experience when you're able to go, you know, go somewhere, even if you don't know persons, you know, they have a good little vibe. They too is the first time they're experiencing wherever, you know, um, we, we, um, they're going and it's, it's, I think group trips with the right people can have a lasting effect on you.
