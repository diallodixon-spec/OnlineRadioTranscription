20251231 205232 The letter started with goodbye I've read it half a million times Tell me this is just a dream When I wake up she'll be next to me Tell me if you'll be just the way you are Well, I keep wondering who's holding down and now And I keep wondering whose heart she's knocking around There's nothing I wouldn't do To be in his shoes right now
