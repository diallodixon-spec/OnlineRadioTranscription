20260101 125033 I was trying to get people to agree with me that the pato is a pretty bird. Now, some people agreed, a few, but you have more persons who disagreed. Beauty's in the eyes of the whole world. Somebody said that. Somebody said that, but this week now I'm asking, what about the Robin Red Breast? When was the last time you saw time you saw one of that long I haven't seen any in a long time yes yes yes so I figured I would get everybody to agree with me that this Robin red breast is really very pretty it's a very pretty boy I love it well I haven't seen it in a long time. I don't have a picture, but physical, but it's in my mind. Right, but somebody just threw something else in the mix. So, well, so too is the mangoes, because the mangoes is pretty with red lips.
