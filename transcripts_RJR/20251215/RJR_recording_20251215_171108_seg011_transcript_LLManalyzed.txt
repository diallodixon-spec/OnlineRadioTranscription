The presiding judge agreed with the defence and ordered the release of the two women. Councillors facing abuse from residents of St. James due to the severe pile-up of garbage across several communities are appealing to WPM Waste Management to upgrade its plan for collection. At the monthly meeting of the St James Municipal Corporation last week, councillors chided representatives of the entity for what they said was the slow pace of garbage removal, adding that some locations had not seen trucks for some time before Hurricane Melissa. This has resulted in mini-dumps and rodent infestation. Councillor for the Catadupa Division, Kenroy Gordon, says based on the report of WPM Waste Management in the meeting, it has not made a dent in the collection of garbage across the second city since September.
