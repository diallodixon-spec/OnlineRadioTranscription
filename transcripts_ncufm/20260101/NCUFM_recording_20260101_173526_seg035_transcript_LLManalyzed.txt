20260101 173526 I'm wishing all members of the Jive all the best for 2026. Yes, I hear you. What you're carrying forward? Tristan Meyers here. Yeah, man, I got the greeting. But this one is saying, hey, Michael and the Jive family, of course, I'm moving forward to 10C UFM. 24 seconds on this song, and then I move on. I mean, if your message is coming within the 24 seconds, I try to include as many as possible. Hey sister, Palamina. Enough love every time. Blessing sister, E. Graham. Anyway, enjoy this one with me, Kevin Downswell, my ear.
