20251231 160806 Tell me that you're coming for me Ooh, you're so sweet, so, so Ooh, unless you like, unless you like If you smoke, what you smoke? I got the haze, purple haze And if you're hungry, you're not just a lady Ooh, baby, don't keep me waiting There's so much love, we come and make it show I'm talkin' kissin', cuddlin' Rose petals in the petals Girl, it's jumpin', it's bumblin' I ain't playin' no games Every word that I say is comin' straight from the heart So if you're tryin' to play it easy I'ma, I'ma leave the door open I'm such that fire for you I knew that rainbow comes again, I testify for you
