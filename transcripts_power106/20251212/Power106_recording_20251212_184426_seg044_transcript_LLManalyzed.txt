20251212 184426 have been held in Kingston and in Moabay, but I think this would be the first time that really significant, impactful games have been played in the country, at least in the last 25 years, if not sooner. So we want to make that happen. We think the people of Jamaica deserve that. I think our players deserve to play in front of their home fans and I think it would be just a crazy fun absolutely you know off-the-chain atmosphere if we're able to make it happen so you know hopefully people can get behind us and help us get there. Mr. Rick Turner, coach of Jamaica's senior men's basketball team, thank you very much indeed. Congratulations, fantastic technical and tactical approach to deliver this victory. Thanks very much indeed sir for being with us.
