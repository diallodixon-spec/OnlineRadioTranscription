I'm stressed now here so I take it all See what the clearing dem a come So I don't hear when dem a talk The world if they don't like this Can't live with life or place them off now We got no label we just vibin' You give me a baby Baby come over, yeah come over Come closer me no got over You can't touch me, baby Come over, no come over May I touch you? I can't take a social distance Internet me say I'm in response Allah you call me a thief You wild, you wild, you wild He said can all these little girls smile again Then lock them up and put them on a stand I don't care where the gov was and I have to go
