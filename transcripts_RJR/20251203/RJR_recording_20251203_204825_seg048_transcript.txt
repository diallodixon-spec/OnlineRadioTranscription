My friend Gigi have the good influence in my perps for your brain make you have confidence Herbs will make you strong and cool, make you tense, crooked, then you'll stop taking friends Some Americans push up the lights and make me see because we're not techno-coco Real urbanists don't run crooked, Joe Herbs in my brain go straight to airport, I'm not snarking Nigga, innovate, I'm not promoting OCS but I'm not mule, a fool run past my throat All your sin in my brain makes Charlie Black float I'm up in the sky, I'm in the sun on both. Hey, see back, reboot. From me born till now, herbs never kill a soul. I expect me friend to fire a school goal. Work faster than a panadol wet in cage coal. No police smoke it when them bep on patrol. Me no smoke church or leaf, that's not how me roll. Me't want no confusion up in my Molo Right now I'm higher than a digital pole So Coke get bang or dig a hole Ya can't push off the light and make me see because we're not techno-coker Real herbalists don't run Coke get joke Herbs in my brain go straight to your bowl I don't snort if I need you in a vein, I don't promote myself
