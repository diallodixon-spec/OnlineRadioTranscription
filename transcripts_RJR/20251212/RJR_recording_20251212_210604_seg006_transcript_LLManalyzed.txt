I think you should do something about Melissa and a smile and I said, you know what? I might do something and then after realizing what what the damages and everything and the separation and you know, there's the depression and everything that's been happening to the people as I didn't know what I decided. Yes, I should do something about storm and you know to encourage the people and to also, you know have an uplifting spirit despite of the situation and you know know you mentioned that in your song that a prayer for Jamaica and Jamaica will rise again and and stuff like that what do you plan to visit anytime soon to really see for yourself the devastation yes
