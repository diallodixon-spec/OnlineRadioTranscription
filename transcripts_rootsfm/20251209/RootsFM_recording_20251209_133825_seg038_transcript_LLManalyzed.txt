But look at us now Look what we've found We're storing ice Way off the ground You gave me wings Now I can fly Bursting through the clouds We're shooting light Like the star across the sky I'm in the middle of this bed These thoughts in my head Wish you were on both sides Every turn I see those eyes I smile every time when I think about all of the tears That we both shed through these years
