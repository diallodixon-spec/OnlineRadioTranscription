============================================================

If our time is running out, day after day, we'll make the mundane our masterpiece. Oh my my, oh my my love, I take one look at you, you're taking me out of the ordinary. I want you laying me down to the dead and buried. On the edge of your knife, staying drunk on your vine. The angels up in the clouds are jealous knowing we've found Hopeless hallelujah. Hopeless side of heaven's gate.
