I wrote a piece, you know, that the biggest, the more you have is the more you have to lose, right? And I said, what do I really need to evaluate myself? So you became a minimalist. I've been there from before, but even more so now. What do I really need? How much do I really need, and the whole notion, I've repackaged my life to see that the more things you have to lose, life isn't about things for me, it's about relationships, it's about what you give, what purpose you serve in terms of the community. It's a good feeling to go to Hannover and to go to Westmoreland and give. I find it so therapeutic. In fact, you do it anywhere you are. You can do it on the radio.
