I would not put my child as a police officer on the front lines and not tell them to defend themselves if fired upon or if their lives are in danger. That number will come down over time if we continue using, as we say, the intelligence-led approach and strengthening the oversight mechanisms that will ensure that police do not transition at some future time into an armed occupation.
