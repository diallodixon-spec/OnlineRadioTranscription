20251217 184328 I know better, it's not Time testing but I'm strong With love on my mind, love in my thoughts carrying on Why nobody no believe In a love again Because every love that lost Nobody no believe In a God again Seems our faith is lost Nobody no believe And it hurts more Turn the lights on, the world's so dark Still I believe That love is everlasting Yes, I know Love is everlasting
