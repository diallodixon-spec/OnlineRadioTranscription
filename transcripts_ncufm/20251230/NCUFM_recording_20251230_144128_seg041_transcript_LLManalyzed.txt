20251230 144128 your church family just like in school I learned oh there is a tough math problem my teacher said once you start get piece of it teach it to somebody the more you teach it the more you grasp it today drive time family may we remember that growth is not about compassion not not not compassion growth is not about comparison comparison is the the thief of joy I've always heard. Growth is about connection. So as we stay rooted in Christ and committed to one another, allow God to faithfully mature you as a part of his family in a reflection of his love. Let's talk to God together dear Father. Thank you for placing all of us in a spiritual family. A spiritual family where growth is possible. Thank you Jesus. Help us to remain teachable, help us to remain humble and help us to open your work in our lives.
