20251231 173115 time for our feature the Kids Zone and for all our little ones who are tuned in let me say a special good afternoon to you it is December 31 and the question for all little ones what's one thing you achieved in 2025? One thing that went well for you in 2025. One thing that you're proud of that you did in 2025. And what's one thing you're looking forward to for the new year, 2026? Little children come and stamp your feet. Come children to laugh and play and sing. Little children give praises to your King. Little children, little children come and clap your hands.
