countries as they're now called. Whenever they run into economic hardship, the first thing they do is talk about migration. What it does is, and it's what Hitler did, so Hitler created an enemy. Hitler himself may not have been totally anti-Jewish, but he created the Jewish enemy for the Germans to focus on. And then you go to war, and then that's how you do it. So what these countries do, if you look at what's happening in the UK, it's all about migration. And I've been there, seen it, done it under the structure. Anybody, whenever they have a problem, oh, we have too many immigrants. They might take away jobs, they might take away women. The only difference now is, in places like the UK, is that the immigrants are from Eastern Europe, as opposed to black countries. But they still have the Muslim argument. You remember when Trump did first come in the Muslim ban, that was his first level of attack. Now he's in problems.
