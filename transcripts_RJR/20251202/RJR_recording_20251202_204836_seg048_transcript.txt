experience, from the Eden experience. And just to say that we are a full house this past weekend. We're grateful to all the persons who participated. We have two guests from that cohort. And I guess sometime, perhaps in January, we'll engage with two others that will be able to share with us their experiences. Still having some challenges, Mrs. G, in trying to get them back on the line. The lines had dropped. So what I'm going to ask is if they could possibly try calling the station line again. don't know let me let me share our telephone number give them the um the the 926 i'm not sure which number should we ask him to try on and and nobody has called this number please
