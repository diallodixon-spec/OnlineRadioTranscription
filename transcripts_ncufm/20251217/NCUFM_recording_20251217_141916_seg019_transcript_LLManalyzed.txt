20251217 141916 I was getting a hand shell and a foot shell so I'm just hopping on the bus. It's raining here. So I'm checking in for a full Wednesday with who we show for Matthew J. Wright, who we produce Abigail Williams, who we drive time family through a local artist. So I'm on the road, I'm ready to go. Vroom, vroom. Shout out to our driver, M-I-C-A-L Forsyte. And God bless you all, drive time family. God bless. Bye.
