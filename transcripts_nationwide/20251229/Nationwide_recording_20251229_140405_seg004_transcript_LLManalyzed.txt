20251229 140405 There's one thing I can't stand is me hearing you so early in the morning The best 9 to 5 I have is surely getting too mean For the third time this week I think I'm gonna have to call in sick If I leave you now I'll be losing my mind I hope we never get tired And I never have to go to work No one knocking on the door Disrespecting, but no disturbance Sorry, no baby crying And no horn blowing just the whisper of our voices all day long A man who don't sweet treat his woman, surely wasting a lot of time She might not say it, but she needs tenderness in her life
