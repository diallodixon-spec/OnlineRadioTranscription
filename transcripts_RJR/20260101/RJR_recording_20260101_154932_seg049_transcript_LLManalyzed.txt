So that rickety now, and I said, eh? So the body's just gammy now, the rabbi in the whole body, mic it strong and said, I'm saying, so body's just coming, you know, rambling over body, mic each other, and so I build the groove, and... And we build up the sound, then mic each other, do the arrangement, then rambling and rambling. So Peter was really good, and when we go record him, never say anything, we just play. Just take him guitar and sing. And we just play. And just vibe with him on the screen. Yeah, and vibe with him playing. And when you're on tour, we set the program. Okay.
