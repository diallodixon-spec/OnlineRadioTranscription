So I wouldn't expect that. But I would say even if you have, you know, other commitments, even just starting with just a little bit of time, I think, you know, sometimes we avoid a small step because we're trying to take a huge step. Right. I would say even just looking for an opportunity to give half an hour here or there and just just helping out someone. I think that's a good step to start with. And I think that there's a saying when you volunteer, you always get more than than you give. And I know that that's something that we've found in our time as volunteers. Of course, for us having the faith element, it really helps everything as well when you feel like, OK, there's a God that sees everything. But the bottom line is that I think everyone just needs to start somewhere. And I would just encourage people to just look for some small step they can do and then see what happens from there. For real. Absolutely. And Alysia, I know I'm mispronouncing your name. I heard your husband say it and that wasn't how I sounded. Please pronounce your name.
