20260102 185436 West Ham is struggling and Wolves would feel you know that something could be there for them. I think this game will end in a 1-1 draw as well. I'm anticipating another score draw. We saw seven of the ten matches in matchday 19 and then in drawn results and I think that will continue this weekend, the continued drawn fixtures. Any, any avoidance of defeat for Wolves means another point, which is a result, based on what has been happening. Yes, a big result for them. Yes, absolutely. Yes. Okay. At 12.30 tomorrow afternoon is going to be, oh, Bournemouth will be at the Vitality Stadium and they will welcome Arsenal. Yeah. If it were another team, I would believe that Bournemouth could get three points here but this Arsenal team is really humming at the moment. I don't think Bournemouth has the quality to stop them from getting three points and I think that they'll struggle to score against this
