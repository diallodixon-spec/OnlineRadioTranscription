20251231 133421 public because I know a lot of people will say they didn't see it. Okay. But it's important because I know, a lot of people want to watch the fireworks in Kingston. Fireworks still happening across Jamaica, which is, I think, a good thing. But the police are advising motorists that they will be prosecuted if they park along Palisades Road in Kingston for the purpose of viewing the annual New Year Fireworks show. They put a lot of advisory today saying that such action is illegal. They said absolutely no vehicles will be permitted to park on the roadway. Additionally, no parking will be allowed on the right-hand side of the road heading towards Norman-Malley International Airport 5 p.m. on Wednesday to 1230 a.m. on Thursday. I'm saying that because I know that if there's a flight, folks usually have flights coming in. That's where some people would park on that side leading to the airport to wait. It'd catch no one here.
