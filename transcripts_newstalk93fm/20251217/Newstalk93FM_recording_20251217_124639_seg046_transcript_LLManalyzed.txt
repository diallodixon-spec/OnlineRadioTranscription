20251217 124639 Oh my my, oh my my love I take my look at you, you're taking me out of the ordinary I want you laying me down, to the dead and buried On the edge of your knife, staying drunk on your vine The angels up in the clouds, are jealous knowing we've something so out of the ordinary. You got me kissing the ground of your sanctuary. Shatter me with your touch, oh Lord, return me to dust. The angels up in clouds are jealous, knowing we've burned Hopeless hallelujah Hopeless side of heaven's gate Oh my life, I'll do ya Breathe in, take my breath away
