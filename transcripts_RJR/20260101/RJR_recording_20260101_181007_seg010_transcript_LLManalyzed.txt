20260101 181007 people entrusted the opposition with increased responsibility. In the September general election, they increased their support for us by some 100,000 vote and doubled the number of constituencies we represent in parliament, increasing our members of parliament to 28. It is therefore clear that many Jamaicans are seeking a different style of leadership that embraces integrity, accountability, accessibility and responsive governance. Our strengthened position in the parliament allows us to scrutinise government actions with greater forcefulness and effectiveness as we to battle the blaze using three medium jets. No one was injured.
