20251223 101507 it wasn't when I was a child and growing up with boys, it wasn't all them take out them go. No, it was more of police. I am a police. I'm a soldier. I'm going to protect you. I know thief or whatever that kind of vibe that quickly changed me. I know when we blink what I and something changed. All right. What went wrong? You said you don't know what went wrong, but tell me where you think it went wrong. Something went wrong with a generation in raising them. I feel as though persons got tired and we drop, we drop on some Pitney. And when you listen to children speak now, we're still dropping our hand. Um, when it comes to, um, instilling certain values, core values in our children, you know, a lot of times we're out here, we're buy, I was speaking about it earlier today in the show that we are buying gifts and we are doing this and we are buying down the place to Pitney, but we are not sitting down and having a conversation with our children.
