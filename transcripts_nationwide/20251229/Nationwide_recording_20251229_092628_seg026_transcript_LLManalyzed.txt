20251229 092628 I am a green card holder. I filed for my three sons in 2021 and I have heard nothing yet. But they never said their three sons how old the sons are but if they're adults or they're minors but for example if they're minors right now they're actually at 2024 so if you file in 2021 at least the I-130s should have been available right now and the visa number is actually available because right now they're at February 2024. Now, if it's an adult child, and of course that adult child has to be unmarried because green card holders cannot file for married children, they're only at December 2016. So if you file in 2021 you can see there's what another four five years or so to go before they'll get to you all right uh thank you so much for that opal we're up on another break we're gonna take the break and then when we come back we'll take more of your calls i hear that paul
