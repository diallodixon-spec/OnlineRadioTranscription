============================================================

to be the parliament itself when it when it resumes, we'll have to discuss the matter and I imagine Mrs. Holness would want to make a statement to the house on the matter. We're not able to reconnect unfortunately but but but it is something that needs to be discussed and as you heard her say that there were people just there who were just not doing they weren't doing anything. They weren't doing their jobs and you know how it is in the public sector. Unfortunately, sometimes people don't do their job and there are no consequences until you just stay put. And Ricardo, remember Mrs. Holness got a lot of flak for that reprimand that she made of Mrs. Curtis just before she left the Houses of Parliament. So I can also understand why she's so very much careful in saying anything about the previous Clerk of the House. But it has to be discussed. It has to be discussed in terms of what was happening at the Parliament, such that Colleen Lowe, I believe is the current Clerk's name, has had to do so much of a cleanup job. Yeah.
