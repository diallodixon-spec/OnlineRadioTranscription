20260102 203232 I get the money, money for two foot Over my retina, when you come through Now you be my person, a person Forget each other, I need blessing Other guys, they don't teach me lesson See, not only you ain't no distressed person, a person So many things you did do, nobody do me like you do, carry you from my head, my shoulder, walk up on you, my knees and toes. When you behind me and no one's super, nobody do me like you do. My baby, somebody do me like you too, baby.
