20251224 184025 Nice PHA chorale there and hoping we'll see them in action. We had to put off National Journalism Week this year because of, of course, Hurricane Melissa and all the difficulties that created. So I'd love to hear them in action again. Okay, moving now to a song chosen by Nakinsky Robinson and Nakinsky also comes comes from down west, so you know, enough love to her and her family. Just Sandy in Berlin Court says, I get emotional every Christmas whenever my door door is not around. Date of death, August 1993, thanks for the vibes, enough blessings enough blessings just Sunday blessings to you as well and if it's important more says please play up Christmas Carol from either Sanchez or Ricky Steve Richie Stevens I will check the log alright so Nakinski wanted 12 days
