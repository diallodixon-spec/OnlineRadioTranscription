2025-12-12 16:04:17 Ghetto Splash chief organizer Patrick Roberts says the annual free concert will not be held this year. Roberts assured that while the free stage show would have undoubtedly helped to lift the spirits of many Jamaicans during the holiday season, relief efforts remain the country's top priority and a move he wholeheartedly understands and agrees with. It has been challenging working behind the scenes to still have the event this year, and we just have to understand that, while it may be a sad outcome this year, it is justified. and so we have decided to pass on this year and focus on coming back in 2026. Roberts assured that corporate Jamaica's prioritization of relief initiatives was not the only reason behind the show's cancellation
