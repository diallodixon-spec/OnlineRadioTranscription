20251224 153934 Tonight There's always times like these when I think of you And I wonder if you ever think of me Cause everything's so wrong and it doesn't belong Living in your precious memory Give me a second eye I need to get my story straight My friends are in the bathroom In the Empire State My lover, she's waiting for me Just across the bar My seat's been taken by some sunglasses Asking about a scar, and I know I gave it to you months ago I know you're trying to forget But between the drinks and subtle things, the holes are my apologies You know, I'm trying hard to take it
