We will conduct patrols, we will conduct beats, we will ensure that the traffic across highways and within townships are moving in a very free, unobstructed and safe manner. The objective is to ensure public safety and order and facilitate a smooth flow of traffic. One of the things that we also have to do is increase our intersection management. Even though we have a number of intersections that we have our junction boxes showing to people that they should not stop within the intersections. Inevitably, persons do that and it causes more delay. The JCF will also employ strategies to maintain public order, particularly in town centres in the parishes that have been hardest hit by Hurricane Melissa. One of the primary things we do is to implement one way.
