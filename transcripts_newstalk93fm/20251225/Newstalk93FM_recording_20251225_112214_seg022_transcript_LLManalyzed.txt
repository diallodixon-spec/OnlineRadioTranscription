20251225 112214 What we have is endless Take away all my stress It's so familiar and still so brand new Every day with you feels like deja vu Like we've always known it, the day before we met. Feel so cool to me. This is a fact. Our love is like summer. Kiss me always, from sunlight to moon rays, January to December. Loving you is summer forever.
