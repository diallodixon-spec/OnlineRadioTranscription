20251222 180102 It's now time for the evening sports report here on NCU FM. I'm Dawson Hossain. We kick off with football as Liverpool have confirmed that striker Alexander Isak has undergone surgery after sustaining a fracture to his left leg in the weekend win over Tottenham. The club say the Sweden international suffered an ankle injury that included a fibula fracture and was successfully operated on, though no official recovery timeline has been provided. However, Isak is expected to be sidelined for several months. The 26-year-old was introduced from the bench in North London and made an immediate impact, scoring to break the deadlock for Arne Slot's side.
