Do you have little happiness in all your life? Now, you used to so fight night, day, war, night. Oh, so I'm gonna suffer for me please, I'ma lay back. Me see the trouble, me I leave that. Inna me shoes, I'ma tank top, yeah. Inna me jeans, I cut off from my foot. Inna mi shoes with some bright color socks. Tight mat, but me nah go wearin' no flip flops. Cause none of this how me mood. Me dress how I can I mood. Don't make me rock and move.
