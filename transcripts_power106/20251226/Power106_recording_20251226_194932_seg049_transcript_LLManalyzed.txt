20251226 194932 But I wanna take you somewhere tonight Lord, yeah Because I see it in your eyes, I say I see in your eyes I say you're tired of the 9 to 5 Plus the boss boy have you in an overdrive But I say the fire man, you like your vibe So let me take you to the forest, we go sightseeing Chilling on the beach with you beside me Paparazzi ask if you want me wifey When you wanna go But I'm willing to take you there I don't know if a bike or a bicycle But baby come let me take you somewhere And I don't where you wanna go Girl girl Come with me, love So much things to see, so much things to see And I don't know if I'm each other, if I'm outside But I wanna take you somewhere
