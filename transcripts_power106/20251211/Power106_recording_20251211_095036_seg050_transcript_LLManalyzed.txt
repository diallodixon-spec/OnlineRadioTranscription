type of disaster release and we have set up this new agency and nobody has told him about it and he said that he talked to all the people that he know that can do the work and nobody talked to them. That's what is happening. I don't know if you have competent people and you shell them and then you get people without the experience and the demonstrated ability because this thing is not easy it takes decades of experience it takes a certain mindset that everybody can get a job yeah understand so um we have a lot of problems we have a lot it's very yes very depressing and my people are at risk The microlenders are at risk. They have to stand up strong, you know, especially the smaller ones. Yeah. Not only them, but their clients who are the people you're talking about, who borrow in their own name, those small businesses, they're at risk.
