20260101 184019 We were down from the beginning When the world wasn't listening Now that I got your attention Let us in with a benediction Gathered here today Paying our respects to being broke Hope he's in a better place Cause life out here ain't sweet, oh no I would close my eyes to sleep, I didn't dream no more So I had to make a way for my home, you know Now I'm in the place where I ain't gotta scheme no more The good life, done with the hood life I did what I could, and always do what I should And I was misunderstood So many nights I tried To hide how I felt, I would cry inside And I ran through the streets till my feet got tired Cause I wanna have my shoes on the power line But I made it, and it made me I know I did wrong complaining that he forgave me
