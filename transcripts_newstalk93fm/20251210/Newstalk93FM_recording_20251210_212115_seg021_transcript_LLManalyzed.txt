============================================================

I don't know about you, but I come here to fight Come to play a mask I'm not leaving until I wet Come to play a mass I don't live my life with regrets No, I come to jam on a bumper Come to drink all the liquor Until my head's gone And I'm miserable All down on the ground I'm causing trouble Look how these security watch me They don't want me in the party, they don't want me cos I'm drunk.
