20251222 145237 today will be the end that assisting you back. So one and can clap. You get what I'm saying? So you have to learn to love each other equally. Let us share this particular joy, this moment. And once you're sharing, you're good to go. If you're not sharing, trust me, can you carry a motor car in your grave? No. Can you carry a bank account in the grave with your money? No. It ain't got no use to you. So free up, man. Help somebody today, man. No joke about it. Seriously speaking, give an helping hand today, like right now. Don't just let your brothers and sisters go down in the dirt. Help them. Trust me, it would be good if you help somebody today. In the meantime, feel free to call me up if you want to be a part of this reality. It is easier as A-B-T by just picking up your telephone on dial 8-7-6-7-9-1.
