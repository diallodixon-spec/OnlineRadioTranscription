20251219 121009 you have another call coming in. Hello. Jason. welcome. Touch me in the name of Jesus. Drugs for blood coverage, drugs for guidance and protection. Cover brother Jesus to provide for him, strengthen him, touch his family, touch where he live, shoot the blood there. Oh God, grant him on command favor, wash and cleanse in thy blood that flows upon every cross. Oh God, we pray, Lord God, for guidance and protection to the security guard, the police, the soldiers. Cover them, Jesus, who have water to bless, to say that they seek it, place of the most high.
