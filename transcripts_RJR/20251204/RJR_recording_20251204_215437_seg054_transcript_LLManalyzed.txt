============================================================

Until then, we'll have to muddle through somehow. So have yourself a merry little Christmas now. You know it is. You know it's a carol here, Christmas. That's what we do, isn't it? Island style, you know? Faithful friends who are dear to us Gather near to us once more Through the years we'll all be together
