20251224 114832 Hey Alton Ellis man what a singer you know he played some of his songs yesterday and of course in the Christmas song that Carlene Davis has she mentioned him also he's a singer singer everybody wanted to sound like Alton Ellis. His voice is totally impeccable. Listen up, man. You're the instrument, not the song, man. Hey, yo! The only problem I have with these songs is that they're too short. It's two minutes. So I gotta play it about three times, right? Hey, Alton Ellis! Christopher Ellis! You're doing good. Your dad's proud of you, Christopher. Alton!
