20251219 150303 It's a weekend, you understand? It's become only our sense. It's a weekend. You understand't care if you don't care. We are the island. I don't know, I don't know. I don't have a word for it. I can't tell you what I've got. Don't worry about me. If I don't come home in the morning, just know that I say it's not in my place. But this man's hold on me I can't leave Until every single bottle down If anyone looking for me then You can find me wherever I'm washing I am eating, people fighting So complain if they want to know
