20251224 161011 I don't think I have like traditions per se, but I just know that since I've been back to Jamaica, I've always either visited a church and then I go out afterwards. But I don't know, like since I've gotten just a little bit older, I just don't like going outside any at all. But then I just don't want to go outside on New Year's Eve because I just feel like it's just bad omen yeah i don't know why you think so yeah yeah well for me it's usually church yeah i'm at watch night service and then my church is literally downtown so we can when we come outside we can see the fireworks oh yeah so we just come outside and watch the fireworks after church and then yeah and that's it um if i've had one or two years where i've gone out with friends after um but yeah mostly just church and then i usually go home after jerry are you usually booked definitely all right so the thing is if i'm booked normally
