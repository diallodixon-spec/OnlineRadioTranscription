And as Miss Mullings rightly mentioned, you know, look at just look at the talents, look at what you're good at. You may be able, as she rightly mentioned, to use social media to bring eyes to a particular thing. You might be able to go and, you know, go build a school, you might be able to volunteer. But my thing is, I think it comes down to just being kind and doing something good for somebody else. I think once you have that sort of mindset, it moves the conversation and it moves the society towards one of giving, and especially now when so many of us have been so negatively impacted.
