Just go to the person and ask what I have done and see how that goes. One of my, I think, housemates or some HS mate lost his life. Oh like that He got promoted and they took him out to Blue Hole and and they were drinking in a bar a friend called him out and he left his drink and boom and The poison and they poisoned him he died in the water now people come to steal and make mischief for people and some of them are not even qualified. I tell you. No man. That is a real thing. Bad mind. When them tell you say bad mind worse than Obia. You think a joke them a make? You think the scene is a joke?
