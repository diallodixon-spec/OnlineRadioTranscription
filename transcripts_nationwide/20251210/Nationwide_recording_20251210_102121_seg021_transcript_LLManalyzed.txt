who take for granted, sending our children to school, and you live near here, it's a little short walk home, and there's a safe space to walk, meaning that it's highly likely that if the child follows that path, a certain path, a bicycle won't bounce them, a car won't knock them down, so you put them out of harm's way, so you say, walk along this path and come because you don't live far. Maybe even that will have to be rethought. Because a six-year-old girl, I want to describe the man in a certain way, but I can't because the broadcasting commission would write me. A man taking a six yearyear-old girl and knowing he did wrong because them same cut through some bush to try to throw off those who may have been pursuing him. And I don't know if this is the mercy of God, it's the mercy of Barnswell.
