20251225 204527 You like to find a way to show the things that words can't say. Why don't you give love on Christmas Day? Oh, the man on the street and the couple of stains. Oh, need to know there's someone who cares. Give love on Christmas Day. No greater gift is there than love. When the world needs your love, just the one needs your love. Why don't you give love on Christmas Day? Oh, every little child all sad just he has room for your love underneath his teeth. Give love on Christmas Day.
