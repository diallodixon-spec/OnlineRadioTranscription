20251225 215525 I don't wanna live, I don't wanna breathe, yeah Just wait on me Lord, won't you take this pain from me? I don't wanna lose, I don't want to breathe, yeah I'm so tired of the rain, keep my life And I'm so tired, of the strain Sometimes I can't sleep at night and just sit here and just on me. Oh, won't you take it? Dream on me.
