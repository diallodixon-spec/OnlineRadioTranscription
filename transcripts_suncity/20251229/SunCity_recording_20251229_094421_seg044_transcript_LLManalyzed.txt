And if it's a case where you're unsure, don't open your mouth because you're not sure. And that's another thing to men. Don't open your mouth and say nothing if you're not sure, because maybe it's just a little freshness, a little newness, and you're head giddy right now.

You understand me? You have to be careful. Sometimes you just hold your mouth, man, and make sure before you say anything. That's another thing we need to learn. Keep quiet until there's certainty, until you're sure and you're ready to make a decision before you open your mouth and say anything. I think, you know, be mindful of that.
