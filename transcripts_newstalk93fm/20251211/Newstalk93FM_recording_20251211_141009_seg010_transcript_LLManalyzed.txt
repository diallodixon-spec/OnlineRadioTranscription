============================================================

I'm not coming home tonight. We don't have to fight baby Come and take a life with me. I swear to the sun, replace the moon. Don't send us a sponge, it's a fine day. I'll turn the road a lining. Tell them that it's all that happened. Hey, hey, you won't see me Wednesday. Don't send a sponge.
