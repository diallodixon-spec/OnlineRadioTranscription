20251230 140104 I have a lightning spirit Early in the morning I hat it Me cooler ready, me ice done ready Me punching that's automatic I have a lightning jumbie A kind of energy inside me And it ready for the rum Ready, ready for the rum, ready, ready, ready For the rum, let we go It's action time, here we go! Hands up! This vetting spirit of me feeling good!
