20251218 114836 All right, welcome back to Power Talk. We're coming to you from the Christmas Farmers Market in the yard here at Broadcast House, 32 Lindhurst Road. A number of booths, as I mentioned, around the place, showcasing some of the products that we've been able to garner after Hurricane Melissa. So again, to my left I see different vegetables, some sizable cabbages, probably cost about $42,000. Carrots, melon, which is good to see but you just wonder how broad this recovery is already and I'd be surprised if we can even start to talk about a recovery just yet. But maybe somebody with a little more information is the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Mining.
