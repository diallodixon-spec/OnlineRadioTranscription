I am your master, Whitsie! You know we go! I wanna fly But I don't got no wings to fly, girl Fly away with me Forever with me, wanna be I love you And you give back your love into me Touch me if you could Let me wanna fly I know I was made for you The way that you were made for I-I-I-O Girl you give me butterflies When I look into your eyes I wanna fly But I don't got no wings to fly
