============================================================

And we have two clips that we'll play to start that. And then at 10, 10 this morning, our guest will be Mr. Richard Mullins, who is the president for the Master Builders Association. And indeed, at 11, 10, we will be talking to attorney at Law Stacey Knight. She was one of the attorney that represented Paul Buchanan in the situation between himself and Prime Minister Wholeness. And certainly we'll talk to her about that based on the judgment that flowed yesterday. All right? And of course we will open the phone lines at 9.35. So stick and stay with us for the duration of your program, your mid-morning number one fix right here, and the big 93 FM. Again, my name is Conor DeBrien. They call me the fireman. And indeed, we continue to burn right here and the big one, 93 FM.
