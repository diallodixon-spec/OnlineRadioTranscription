Now, they haven't seen the act committed and expunged it. Here in Jamaica, that act would not be expungable because anything under the Terrorism Prevention Act would not be expungable. But if it is expungable abroad, having been committed abroad, we see no reason why it should not be expunged here. And that is so for many other offenses. You know, we don't know the regime of that country, how they decide which offense and how how it is dealt with. And they having expunged the record of a board, then why should we keep it? Now, I'm not denying that it seems, it could look inconsistent.
