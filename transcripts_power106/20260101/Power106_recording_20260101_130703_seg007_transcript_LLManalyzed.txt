20260101 130703 When you're lying here in my arms I'm suddenly hard to believe We're in heaven Love is all I need And I found it there in your heart It isn't too hard to see We're in heaven I've been waiting for so long For something to last For love to come along Now our dreams are coming true Through the good times and the bad Yeah, I'll be standing by you
