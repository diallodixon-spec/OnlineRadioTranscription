I don't want to know your vibe. Oh, yeah. Listen to me. I put some carrots in your hair. Make this stitch up. I want to put it in the ring. Want to give D. I serve it doesn't get sweeter. Feel my body banging like speaker. Ooh, sweating on my concealer. Skin tight, no millimeter. And my face can't make him feel weaker. But you know that my body is a healer. Ooh, I love to make you jump, jump, jump.
