Hello, George. Greetings from a Jamaican residing in a foreign country, but more importantly, watching you live and direct on YouTube. Respect to the NNN team. I won't say the other part, but thank you for the good thoughts, Isabella. I see Mark and Shane having a private conversation in the group. Several sentiments in the group seem to suggest that Corey is being motivated by an invisible hand. Not my words, it's the sentiment of those in the YouTube chat. The concept of the invisible hand came forth to many of us through economics. Some people were exposed to it at high school, others of us learned the thing in university for the whole of first year and second year, or just first year alone. I think two years, yeah. And it came forcefully towards this concept of the invisible hand when we had to read The Wealth of Nations, Adam Smith, and how the invisible hand dictates market forces.
