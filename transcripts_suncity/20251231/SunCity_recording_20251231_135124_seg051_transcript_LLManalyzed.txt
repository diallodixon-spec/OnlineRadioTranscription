20251231 135124 This morning, smile with the rising sun. Free living birds, it's by my doorstep. Singing sweet songs of method and pure and true. Singing, this is my message to sing. Cause every little thing is gonna be alright. This morning, I have the rising sun. Oh, I'm breathing it back. It's fine, I don't care.
