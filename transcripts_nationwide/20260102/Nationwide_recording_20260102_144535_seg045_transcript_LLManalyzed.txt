20260102 144535 I can never tell how do you sleep so well You keep telling me to live right To go to bed before the daylight But then you wake up for the sunrise You know you don't gotta pretend Baby, now I'm in, but you just wanna wake up Dark as a lake, smelling like a bonfire Lost in the haze If you're drunk on life, babe, I think it's great, but while in this world I think I'll take my whiskey and leave Like coffee black in my bed at three You're too sweet for me, you're too sweet for me
