We'll make it hard with me, that isn't the case Cause I think it's so easy to fall in love So come give me a call and we'll fall into us I'm the perfect mix of Saturday night and the rest of your life Anyone with a heart would agree It's so easy to fall in love with the way i do my hair the way i make you laugh the way we like to share a walk in central park i could be fresh air might be the girl of your dreams there's no need to hide if you're into me Cause I'm into you quite intimately And maybe one night could turn into three Well, I'm down to see you cause I make it so easy
