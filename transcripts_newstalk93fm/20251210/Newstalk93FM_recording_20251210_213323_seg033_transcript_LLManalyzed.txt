============================================================

I could keep my cool, but tonight I'm wildin' I'm a bee, yeah In a dangerous mood, can you match my timing? Telling me That you're really about it, why'd you hide it? Talk is cheap So show me That you understand, I like it can you blow my mind sit off my whole body if i give you my time can you stretch my soul from it i don't want want to wait. Don't take it. Take me where I ain't been before. Can you blow my mind? Set off my whole body.
