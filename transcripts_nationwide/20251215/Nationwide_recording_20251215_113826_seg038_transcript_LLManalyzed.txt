20251215 113826 My best friend's having a party and everybody's going I know it's gonna be a lot of fun Oh, by the way, it's snowing It's been a long, long time And it's late while you close my mind I guess it's just too late Gee whiz, it's Christmas It's funny that I haven't got to call you before And why is it I haven't got to call you before. And why is it I haven't seen you around anymore? Another year has passed and I can't erase the memory of your smiley face.
