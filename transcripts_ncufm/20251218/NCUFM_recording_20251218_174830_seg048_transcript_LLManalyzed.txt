20251218 174830 home so I had gone to invest a lot of the money because I'm the risk taker and then those schemes would have collapsed them so it was very hard to work back all that money in a short space of time and I decided to leave and I left for five years but during that five years I really got bored and that was when I studied sonography so I left here here basically as a radiographer. I did CAT scans and mammograms along to you since moving? So during that time, they really had a shortage for persons to do ultrasound.
