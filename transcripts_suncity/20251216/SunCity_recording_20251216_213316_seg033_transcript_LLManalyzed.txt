20251216 213316 Gerson is one of two Geisel High School students who continues to represent the high standards and excellence of their institution. His love for agriculture wasn about my real estate, it just made me even more sure that I feel something in agriculture and that I deserve it. And I also want to become an agricultural engineer. So doing well in agriculture feels like the first step towards achieving that dream. You know, agriculture is very important for developing the country. It's a very big part of our country. And in the wake of Hurricane Melissa, which severely impacted the agricultural sector, particularly in St. Elizabeth, Jerson found renewed purpose. The destruction only strengthened his tenacity to contribute to the sector and help rebuild.
