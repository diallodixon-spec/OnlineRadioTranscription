20251212 192523 very good work indeed a couple of good exercise get ups here for him and I think he's the one that I'm going for to win this event Linton Steadman will ride then you have the other um the Canadian bred Atlantic convoy from the camp of Patrick Ling to be written by Dane Nelson and this one um on the 29th of November was up against California Crown and was beaten six and a half length. Rather one paced race. I think it's going to perform much better here. And then we have the in-form local bread to the warrior to be won by Roman. To the warrior, of course, thoroughly game-tenant and consistent. He has won five of 25 races. Could have been more, but such is racing luck. Roman went right. So it's going to at this point come three. I think we can put in the mix here, number three, Teflon Dawn, to be written by Halley Dean for Jason Custer. I am going here for Atlantic Convoy, the better of number six, Major Dangerless.
