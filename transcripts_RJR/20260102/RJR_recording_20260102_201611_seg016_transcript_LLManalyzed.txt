20260102 201611 I like to frolic plenty, so from early in the year I save. I done buy my ticket to all parties, so this season I pull in a break. So when I return, sign my venue. Don't bother ask me who link you, who send you. I just picking up artists and shows where me like live food and a Japanese venue. Now I watch all me friends them good last year, they party for the whole year straight. And this season come them having problems, when they want to pass by certain kids. So when they have to handpick all the party, I just get to watch them and laugh. I go and tell me stage show, link with any artist, get pictures and autograph, we rolling in. All of them. Bungie Garland says hey.
