People were really asking us even prior to us going over How is the hurricane because they they knew it was coming so that they were members of the team and The other drivers were sort of messaging us. Are you guys okay? So obviously, um, we managed to tell them well based on where we were in the island We Kingston we were okay, but the other parts of the island suffered greatly. So that was a big topic with the other drivers and then the ability for them to try and make a donation which was matched by the S Hotels Foundation that allowed us to raise actually closer to 1.5 million, which we are going to be putting towards a special effort in helping the Savla Marp police who lost their station in, you know, in Melissa.
