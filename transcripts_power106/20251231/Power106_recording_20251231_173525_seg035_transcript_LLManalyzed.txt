20251231 173525 This lonely, lonely feeling hits me all the time Every time you go away, seems I can't live another day I feel a shiver when I wake, come back and give another break I feel a ton of joy, and my heart gets warm Thinking about you holding me, squeezing you in my arm But as the day turns to night Loneliness gives me a fight I'm afraid to close my eyes Yes, it's another sleepless night I feel a shiver, baby I'm a true believer That it's you, it's you I'm thinking of now, now I get lonely, it's so dark baby So lonely
