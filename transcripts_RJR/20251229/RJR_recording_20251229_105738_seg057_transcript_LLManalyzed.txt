20251229 105738 Station Bail. Station Bail, that means... Sorry? It's minor charges, you know. Not necessarily, you know. There are some charges that are minor, you can get station bail on. But murder isn't one of them. No, man. There are some things you can get bail for. Not sure that the extent of the charges laid, but what I will say, I know that you raise it, because I'm looking here and not seeing anything yet about her. As I said, let me hold my tongue that, as I said, being subjudice, her counsel no doubt will make a film. I will. All right? Yes. All right. Well, I'll leave you going to the 11 o'clock news. All the best to you here when it comes. All right? Thank you. All right. Thank you. You too. Bye, sir. Bye-bye.
