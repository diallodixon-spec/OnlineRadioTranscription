20260102 185437 Got a smell of coffee, and I got a wake-up call I was so in love with you, I just don't care at all You say things aren't the way they seem But still you wouldn't come to sleep with me. How can you think that you're in love when you don't know the meaning of love should have brought you home to me last night? You should have been with me, baby Should've been right by my side Baby, don't you care about me, darling Do to me what you do to me last night
