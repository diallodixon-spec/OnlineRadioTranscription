And I must admit, I just started with Montréal in June. And to be already a recipient from the Foundation is tremendous. They have helped me to transition from what was a board structure, now into a blood structure. And it goes on.

It's impressive. Now, tell me, these are two of how many? Over two, almost 200 team members who have been impacted by Hurricane Melissa.
