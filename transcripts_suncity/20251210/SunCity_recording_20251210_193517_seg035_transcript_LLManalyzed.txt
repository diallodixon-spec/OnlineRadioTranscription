Take away yourself from trouble, take away yourself from trouble. Take away, take away, yourself from trouble. You know that. Exploding your sweet life, the gift of life. Walk away from trouble, stay away from strife. Life is to live through the best in life. You only live once, you're not live twice, young. Take away yourself from trouble. From trouble. Cause it come in a double. Take away yourself, from trouble. From trouble, yeah. I say mind is sinking, son. Take away yourself. From trouble, take away yourself from trouble. Cause it come, ain't no double. Take away, yourself from trouble.
