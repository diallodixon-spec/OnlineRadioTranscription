20260102 171008 No trouble, no trouble No, no, no I won't have to cry no more I'll dry my weeping eyes Trouble will be no more When I meet him in the sky Yeah, no trouble, no trouble I see When I get all the job to the other side, there'll be no more, no need to cry. A home of joy and gladness, but no room for sadness. But the best thing about this place, I see my state of face to face Until it's over, until it's done Gonna stay right here, till my change come, never worry
