20251230 114827 We know the Lord will be right there when we cry A fragile praise is still a praise It will be heard when it is raised to the sky We don't need words of eloquence when we talk to him cause the savior is concerned with every care he hears a broken prayer well you can't spray cause you can't see the things you feel inside Your thoughts are scattered like the shattered pieces of your life You don't have to wait any longer Just bring all your trust
