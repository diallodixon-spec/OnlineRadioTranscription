20260102 154531 circumstances bringing his high-profile standoff to a tense but measured close let me tell you something I don't know because there's always your side my side and the truth and there are a lot of semantics when it comes on to quote-unquote contractual agreements yes but based on what if you never pay me for promote if you pay me as for argument's sake if you only be reach out to events like Kareem Can you host this event at another contract Just say hosting between 1 and 5 If me promote it is because of the goodness of my art You understand me? You're not paying me for that You're paying me to host So if me take it upon myself and me post it 2 times That is me going outside of my contractual agreements to post and to promote this event. So you're saying it wasn't in the contract room? Well basically what they must say is whatever it is that they had paid for it was done. So I don't know. And the man just never shows up. Listen it was the man was real. I don't want some of the 50. I want some of the $50,000.
