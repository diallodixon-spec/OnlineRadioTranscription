20251224 165438 Stay warm Taki Lemko and thank you for the great message, lovely warm message coming from a very cold place right now and thank you so much and all the very best to you and your family. Typing as I speak. And let's see here, Metro. Jesse, I've never known the title of this song. The one with the lady sending her lover lots of gifts, including partridge ducks, golden rings. All right, that would be Frank Kelly's Christmas Countdown. Yes, that's Frank Kelly's Christmas countdown, right? Yeah, we played that one in the week. But I can tell you that we're going to end the show with another great song. As we close, a big thank you to our production team, Davin
