The Nike tagline says just do it. That's the simple line. Let's say it's just do it. And in the doing of it, you will learn lessons on the way. You might just accomplish what you set out to do. Or even if you fail, that's still in itself an act of learning. You stepped out. It's an act of bravery. It's to try. So I always encourage people, be brave. Yeah. And I would say, you don't have to be fearless. You can move through the fear. And that's what bravery is. You can act with fear. Yeah. Right. Absolutely. Absolutely. So you're looking on the future and you're saying, OK, this is where I want my business to be in the next couple of years. Where do you see 44 miles in the next couple years, young lady? I'm just hoping to see an evolution.
