20251212 103515 Every Saturday, from 10 to 2, sunrise. The vibes is, take away yourself from trouble. You only live once, you not live twice. You follow the road on the righteous path. Still focus and can't just put you in your tatters. Don't make the wicked them corrupt your heart. Do the right thing, become the one you say you're salt. Take away yourself from truth and from truth.
