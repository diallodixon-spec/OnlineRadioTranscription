We will rise and we will bounce back stronger and more resilient. And one of the things that I think a lot of us need to remember is that even though a lot of us were not in the areas that were directly impacted in that severe way, but we do have families and relatives in those areas and the trauma of it is still impacting us the same. So I just want to say to Jamaica, especially to those that are in those areas, we will rise. We will not stop helping, we will not stop volunteering we will not stop donating until we know that everybody is ok. Alright, thank you so very much Dr Tyrone Smith, President of the Pharmaceutical Society of Jamaica. All the best to you. All the best. Thank you Doc. You're welcome.
