20251219 212318 for a good time soon. Coming from the country with my bag of Kali. I fuck up on a DC in one big old man. Don't you run now, you man. You won't get away. If you slip, you will die. And if you run, you can't't hide But I've got my dick stuck right in my hip now Don't you take my eyeshine Don't you touch my callin' Me children die fi anger. And I mana suffer. So you get to see. It is Kali that feed me. Fifty cent a stick. And a dollar a quarter.
