When my sound play big tunes Light is in the air Vibes up in the street And that's just how it feels When reggae music plays Can't help but move your feet Pull up the vibe cause the music is sweet, yeah Shaggy got lyrics to spin on this beat, yeah, yeah Right back till the morning, ayy Turn up the music, make me rock and come in, right back till the morning Word for the people, follow the place and sound, string up Nadylana
