But before I go on musical high and take the song, I'm going to take a wellness bite, just to get a little knowledge. Yeah, man, just open knowledge a little bit. And then some music, so stay tuned. A Wellness Bite from NCU-FM. Staying active helps prevent chronic diseases. That was a Wellness Bite from NCU-FM. Transforming lives through education and wellness. From the rising of the sun, you've given me everything I need.
