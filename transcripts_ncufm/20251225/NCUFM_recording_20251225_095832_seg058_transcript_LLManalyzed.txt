20251225 095832 In spite of my pain In spite of all I'm going through I'm still here Nobody's gonna take me away, Lord I'm still here I may not have money I may not have faith But I may not have fame, but Lord, I'm still here Nobody's gonna move me, Lord I'm still here There are times when I feel discouraged To the point where I just feel like giving up I'm still holding on, Lord, I'm still holdin' on, Lord I'm still holdi' on Yes, yes, yes, yes I am blessed
