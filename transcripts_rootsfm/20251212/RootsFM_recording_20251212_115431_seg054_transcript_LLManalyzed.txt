20251212 115431 I wish for all mankind A world to make in Christmas time Where there is no snow Where the good sense of evil grow Oh, I wish that we could find True love in Christmas time Don't have to be concerned Show some love and let the peace fly by Where we can party all the night away Or enjoy the beaches where all the lovers play You can take a swim and wash your tears away
