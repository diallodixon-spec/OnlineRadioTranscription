20251225 142528 You're that angel sent from heaven above For me, for you, and you, for you You're in my heart This just is the start babe Without much more to love Than the way you're thinking now To end my ring With something special Now you close the door I'll wait around the door What if this whole world is killing you? I won't take a second chance I don't have to take it And you don't have to fake it anymore
