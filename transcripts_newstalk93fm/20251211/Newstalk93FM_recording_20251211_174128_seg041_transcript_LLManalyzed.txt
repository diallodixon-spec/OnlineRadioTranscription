2025-12-12 11:36:27 Oh, Lord, return me to dust. The angels up in the clouds are jealous. No one will be found. Something so heavenly, higher than ecstasy, whenever You're next to me. Oh, my, my world was in black and white. Until I saw Your light, I felt You had to die to avoid. Something so out of the ordinary. How are you laying me down to a dead and buried? On the edge of your night, staying drunk on your vine. The angels up in the clouds are jealous knowing we found something so out of ordinary. You got me kissing the proud, proud sanctuary. Try to meet what you're taught, or God will turn me to dust. The angels up in the clouds are jealous knowing we found.
