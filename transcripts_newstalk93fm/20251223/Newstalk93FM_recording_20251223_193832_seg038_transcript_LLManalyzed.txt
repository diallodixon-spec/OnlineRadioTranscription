20251223 193832 Why I could only drive one car at a time But I still want to, but I still want to Cause all we need is balance Said I'm fallin', fallin', I'm fallin' As I lay my bed with my head to the ceiling Say I'm drowning alone and I'm lost in my feelings Somebody send me a sign cause you know that I need it Can't even come back to me cause you know you're my healing. I tell these old guys my time I pay, time I pay, my time I pay. Hit ya can't wait, all of my anxiety. Anxiety, my rough my day. I tell you that we all need love.
