20251219 142418 you just pop something in a barrel. It's not taking you out of your way. It is not at all and Fesco was just ready and willing to jump on the initiative with Barito. Excellent. Excellent. Well, we are happy to be here. Anything you want to say to our listeners to encourage them to be a part of what we're doing today? As I mentioned before, we have barrels at the stations. So, if you're not able to come down today, which we would love for you to do, just visit one of the Fesco stations, Beechwood location, the Ova location, and that ferry and drop something in the barrels as you pass. Alright. Come on out and support the initiative. I'm glad. So, guys, even though we're going to be here from 10 AM until. Five. That's a good thing. Five. The barrel, what I'm trying to say, the barrel, they're not going anywhere until they're all filled up. Yes. Then we we and we bring them back. So if you're thinking that, no, oh my gosh, I wish I could catch them, you can. Just bring something and we're going to be very happy that you're here. Thank you, Christine. Thank you so much for speaking with us, guys. We are at Beechwood. They have barrels as well at Ferry. We have some giveaways, by the way.
