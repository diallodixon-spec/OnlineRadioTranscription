20251215 194121 I need to know if you want me for sure. We've been around for too long. I need a commitment to make me feel I belong to someone. So if you like to, then this is your chance to. I'm moving on without you. I gotta find another baby. You say you want me Then you better show me Come on and get to know me And then you will find that I love you And I feel the same We love to be sure I know by now But if we can't prove our love I just think like that I'm gonna move along I've been doing my own thing
