20251212 190809 so we are expecting that there will be a stagger that will take us perhaps as far as mid-year and so some of the properties will not be ready and consequently may have to look at varying options in relation to staff arrangement. Where that is to happen we have full undertaking that the workers will be appropriately and properly dealt with and so we are recognizing the commitment that we have, that we are going to get through this thing together. Support is not only limited to rebuilding hotels, many staff members are also benefiting from the rebuilding initiative. Regional Director of Operations at Rio Hotels, Frank Sundern, says the entity is providing care packages to staff. What we want to achieve with that is that you can take your mind off of getting food and giving beverage. You can focus on rebuilding your house instead of being hunting down with supermarkets and you can only pay cash and so on. And the staff was really appreciative.
