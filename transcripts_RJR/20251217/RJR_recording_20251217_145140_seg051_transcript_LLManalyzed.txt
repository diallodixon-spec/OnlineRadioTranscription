It's way more likely to get it as opposed to your female counterpart at a younger age. So it's very important. I just want to emphasize this one, that in men, because we know how they are and whether they're not necessarily health-seeking, and we know that these issues exist, we need to expose our men, not impose anything on them, but expose them as much as possible to the information that they need to make the best possible health decisions for themselves. Let them know what it is to look out for. If you notice that your legs are swelling, if you notice that they can't lie on flat to sleep anymore, you need to come and check your doctor. Don't watch it and only watch it for years until you end up in the hospital and that is when we try and figure out what's going on.
