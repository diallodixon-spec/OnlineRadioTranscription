20260101 170303 I say it's not easy On my pilgrim's journey The burden I carry Lost more than I can bear Why should I worry When I can break it? I know God will show me how to conquer my faith Where there is life, then there's hope, they say So I know that there'll be a better way All I got to do is open the world and pray And I know that my God will lead the way Just before any of His children
