20260102 180201 Let each one of us examine our own heart. Ask God to reveal to us where we stand and make the decision to trust His word and walk in His truth. On behalf of our pastor, Reverend Mark Dawes, I wish for you a happy and prosperous New Year. I am your host, Donald Blake. May I invite you to join with us for the next two hours right here in 4106 FM.
