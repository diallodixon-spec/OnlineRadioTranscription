20251217 171209 Mr. Swebe says he is not opposed to reform, but for local roads, community infrastructure, and the regulation of entertainment events.

The shift of a single central authority of roads and national premises for entertainment will remove two of our core functions. If roads and events regulation are taken away, what remain with the local government?
