And thankful that you are the host. Lovely having me here too. Bless you. Thank you so very much for that. And let me walk around and speak to Kemar. May I take Georgia away from you for just 30 seconds? Georgia, what was this experience like? I mean, you have been to many farmers markets. This is a small one, but what was it like? Well, I'm happy that I came out here. It was good. I would get to meet some other persons, and we're able to introduce our products to the farmers and the home gardeners that come along. I saw home gardeners buying from you, so that is good. Yes, and that you know and we want to say to the farmers continue to be resilient and Merry Christmas when it comes. Thank you so very much and the same to you. All right Sheridan how much is the cane? $500 for the full cane.
