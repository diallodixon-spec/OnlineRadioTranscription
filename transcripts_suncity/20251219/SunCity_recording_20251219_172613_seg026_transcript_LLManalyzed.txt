20251219 172613 I don't do tears, baby, no chance. I could dance, I could dance. I could dance. Watch me dance, dance the night away. My heart could be burning, but you won't see it on my face. Watch me dance. Dance the night away. I'll still keep the party running, I won't be out you can count on me. I could dance. Watch me dance, dance the night away. My heart could be burning, but you won't see it on my face. Watch me dance.
