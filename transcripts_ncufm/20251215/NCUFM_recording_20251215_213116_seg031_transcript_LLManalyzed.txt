20251215 213116 whom God brings into his hand. But ask the animals, and they will teach you, and the birds of the heaven, and they will tell you. Or ask the earth, and it will teach you. And the fishes of the sea will declare to you, Who among all of these does not know that Yahweh's hand has done this? In whose hand is the life of all living things, and the breath of every human being? Does not the ear test words, and the palate taste food for itself? Wisdom is with the aged, and understanding is in length of days. With him are wisdom and powerful deeds, and to him belong counsel and understanding. If he tears down, then it will not be rebuilt. If he shuts a man in, then he cannot be freed. Look, if he withholds the water, then they dry up, and if he sends them out, then they overwhelm the land. Strength and sound wisdom are with him. The deceived and the deceiver are his. He leads counselors away stripped.
