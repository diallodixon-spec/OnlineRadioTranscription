20251212 203621 I feel just like yesterday when little kids come out to play. You've rejuvenated the youth that's in me and made me feel like singing. Hush my darling, dearest one Slow down on your dub Don't do this to me, my life is shaking up Hush my darling dearest one, slow down on your door Don't do this to me My life is shaking up Can I have another dance with you? And can we spend the whole night true? I'm so happy I've got tears in my eyes I feel just like you
