20251218 120908 Come through this time, please hear my cry. And if I ever let you down, my friend, it was a misunderstanding. So if I took it for granted, you're not promised from today. I go jump like I never jump, wave like I never wave, wind like I never wind before, just to show you I saw you, I saw you. And I need you back in my life. You people by the truck Emotions running high We underpin the sky Tears running down we lie Can't you tell that we're sorry? We're sorry And we need you back in we lie I need you back, I'm back home Come home to me, come home to me Come home to me
