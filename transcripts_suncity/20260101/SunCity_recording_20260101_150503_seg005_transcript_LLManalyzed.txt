20260101 150503 Let's see who hung on for a second. Eleven clear winner, no doubt. Five is there, here comes the ten. Three of them looks like five, ten, and eight. I'm going to stick my neck out and say that's the order of finish. Eleven, five, ten, eight. Sipping on sunshine, no doubt the winner. Clear winner, I should I should say three to one second went to number five Legal bomb third way looks like it went to number ten Sensational gold Legal bomb was at 34 to one sensational gold at seven to one and number eight babla at eight to one so again tells you outside horse is very difficult to go against in a five straight even though Irish wish look much the better this draw a compromise he had to come
