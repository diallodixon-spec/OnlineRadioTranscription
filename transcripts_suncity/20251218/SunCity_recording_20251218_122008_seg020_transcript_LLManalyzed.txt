20251218 122008 This is George Nooks and Sun City. Mothers, you are your son's first teachers. You shape their values, their attitudes, and their understanding of right and wrong. I urge you want to call my baby or wipe the tears from my eyes. Make me a proud mother. Let me see you grow to be a man. This is all I ask of you. I hope you understand.
