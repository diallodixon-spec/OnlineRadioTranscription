So, you may even want to do something. What is it that they like doing baking? So, you bake the thing and make it smell like and look like it's not them who bake it. You're not going to care. Go put it on the grave but you just you're just reflecting on on that moment what joy was like in the house. You can write about it. You can write a letter dear mama, dear papa, dear sister, dear aunt. Just write about it and tell them the updates for what has happened
