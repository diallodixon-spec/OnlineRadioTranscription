20251212 181808 Sometimes the love is though you're glad Little children love you well Love all the wondrous tales you tell Love to watch you come and go In the tides that heaven flow They go and walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will spare no evil Cause joy your is with me. But rather than thy stuff, they comfort me. Splashing, dashing, restless sea. Never still you seem to be. Sometimes angry, sometimes sad. Sometimes you laugh as though you're glad. Splashing, dashing, red as the sea. There are still you seem to be. Sometimes angry. Sometimes sad. Sometimes love, as though your glad. Little children love you well.
