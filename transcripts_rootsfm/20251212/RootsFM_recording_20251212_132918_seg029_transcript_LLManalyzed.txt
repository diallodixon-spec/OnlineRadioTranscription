Who would've thought that we would become lovers As friends we were so, so tired You didn't help myself You made me feel so right I've got to, got to tell you, darling Ooh, baby, I think I love you from head to toe I think I love from head to toe, I know Here's a day gone tomorrow It's possible, I doubt it This kiss is credit in the bag of love Never leave one without it
