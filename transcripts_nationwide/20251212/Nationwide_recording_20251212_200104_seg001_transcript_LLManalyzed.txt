20251212 200104 here with Desmond McKenzie in the Mayor's Parlor. I've got the music to jog your memory and make you smile. Put your sweet lips a little closer to the phone. Sit back, relax, and enjoy the best in vintage music. Come into the Mayor's parlor every Sunday between 1 and 6 p.m. here on Nation in 90 FM a revolution in media Everything loud and wicked every Saturday 3 to 5 p.m. with outside with Pepita. Loan bites, loan laughs, and loan entertainment. Come on the road with me. Because when we say outside with Pepita, we're there all over Jamaica. Anyway, check them out. We're there, there. We're in on the business. Stay tuned in for prizes, surprises, giveaways, guest artists, and nope, nope, nope.
