Power Talk, powering thought, provoking discussions and providing a platform for the voice of the people. Weekdays, 11am to 2pm. It's Power Talk, identifying challenges some, they brought unimaginable loss. Homes destroyed, lives disrupted, and communities cut off from each other. For decades, the RGR Gleaner Communications Group has answered the call in times of crisis. Through the RG Cares Foundation, that spirit of compassion continues. We invite you to stand with us and support our brothers and sisters in need. Please donate bottled water, canned foods, other non-perishable items, and personal hygiene products. Items can be dropped off at our partner church
