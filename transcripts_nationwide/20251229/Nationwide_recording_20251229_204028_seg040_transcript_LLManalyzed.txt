20251229 204028 I start to roll below I explode when we connect When we're together it's so perfect The way you shot me with your wide-eyed love I start to rollover low I explode where we connect It's no exaggeration, not imagination You're the finest boy around Playing a temptation for the nice sensation With the boy from the multi-town Give me your love and affection Dance with me tonight Give me all of your attention Dancing in those lights We connect when we're together
