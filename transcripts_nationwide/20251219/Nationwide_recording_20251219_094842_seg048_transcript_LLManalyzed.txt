20251219 094842 almost completed restoration. Okay, all right, no problem. And the final question for me on the topic of restoration, do you have enough resources in Ireland? I know some areas may need completely new posts. I know the human resources have come in thanks to our neighbors and so forth who are bringing in line men. But as it relates to the equipment and so forth, do we have enough of those on island to complete restoration efforts? With regards to material like wires and poles, yes, we do. And we do have shipments that come in almost every week. So we definitely have material to support the rebuild. With regards to equipment, we are expecting some equipment, trucks included, and specialized equipment.
