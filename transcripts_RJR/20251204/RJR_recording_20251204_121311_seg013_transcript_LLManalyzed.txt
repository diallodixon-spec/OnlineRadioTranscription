A record 279-round third-wicket partnership between Tom Latham with 176 and Murchin Ravindra, 145, guided New Zealand to a 481-1 lead over the West Indies on Day 3 of the first test in Christchurch. Kimar Roach, with 2 for 61, and Jamaica's OJ Shields, 2 for 64, have taken the wickets to fall, as the Kiwis piled up 417-for-4 in their second innings. West Indies assistant coach Floyd Reefer conceded that R out. So that made a difference. But I thought we had a bowling plan. So before lunchtime, we had them in a pretty good position where they were scoring at two point and over. But we kind of let them get away after lunch.
