20251225 103424 I'm coming back Christmas Eve I've been to Paris and I've been to LA I've never dropped it before on my face This Christmas we don't need to get away, get away Cause our love is like a holiday But I know I've been away from you much too long Thank you girl for holding on Believe me when I tell you There's just one place I know I belong Girl, that's why I wrote you this song I've been to Paris, London, LA London, LA
