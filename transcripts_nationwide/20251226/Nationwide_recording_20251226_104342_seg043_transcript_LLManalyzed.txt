20251226 104342 I wanna tell the world I found me a girl Feeling sweet That's how I feel Never had a feeling so real I wanna tell the world about me and you I told my baby that I had to get away That I'd be back another day She didn't even ask me where I had to go She said she didn't need to know Just said she missed me every minute of her time She woke me back on a Valentine's Day
