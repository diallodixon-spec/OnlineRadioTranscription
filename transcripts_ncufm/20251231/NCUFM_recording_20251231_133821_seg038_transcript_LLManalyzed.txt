20251231 133821 I finally see what God can do for you. So tonight, close your eyes. There's no more need to fight. Watch God provide. God provide. It's hard to say when there's no food to eat Or what you see feels all that life will be And will this be another year of misery for me. But my faith can survive on just things I see. And my feelings can control my destiny.
