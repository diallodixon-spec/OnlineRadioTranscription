I can't keep on, baby Can't keep on trying, yeah Everybody knows, everybody knows Almost doesn't count Can't keep on, can't keep on Doesn't mean one foot outside the door I hear a funny hesitation, love Heart does never, never really show Can't keep on tryin', can't keep on trying Maybe you'll be sorry Maybe you'll be cold Maybe you'll come running back, babe From the cruel, cruel world Almost convinced me You're gonna stick around
