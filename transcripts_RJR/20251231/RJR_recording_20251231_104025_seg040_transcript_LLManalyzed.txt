20251231 104025 texting on whatsapp and telling them about the situation with my son from June this year into an exam at heart and he passed it and they said that they are going to call him and until now they don't call him which exam he did which exam hello which which exam did he do on the entry test for heart and there, he went down there, they said that they don't have any teacher, and they are going to call, they will call him. Until now, Mr. Mullins, seven months he's at home sitting down. But the thing is, you know, we could try and find out from them, but the thing is, if they need a teacher to teach the course, that's important. Maybe they haven't got the teacher yet. What they should possibly do, however, is maybe they're waiting to get a teacher to call, but sometimes they have to give a call and say, listen, we know you're waiting, you know, but we haven't gotten a teacher yet or what the situation is.
