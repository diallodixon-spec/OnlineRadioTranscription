Finding a way where you cannot see Mind with the system, we cannot pray I need to find relief But behind my mind it runs All these thoughts have trouble me Finding to give up, I've been Finding to be unwell And my mind, running to the other side When it's time to leave my life Planning trying to take me out Tell you what I need, right, yeah I really need, I really need, I need to free my mind up. I really need to, I really need to free mind up. I need to, I need to, free my mind up, I really need a free my doubt I really need, I really need doubt now To set me free, freer than the open mind Farther than the ice can handle Freer than the ocean now to set me free
