20251223 142214 Set off my whole body, whole body Make me sweat it, make me hotter Make me lose my breath, make me water Make me sweat it Make me hotter, make me lose my breath Make me water Hopefully, you can last all night. Don't get too excited. Oh, privacy. You ain't got to go nowhere. You can stay inside it. Can you blow my mind? No. Set off my whole body if I give you my time Can you stretch my soul from me? I don't wanna wait Don't take it, take me where I ain't been before
