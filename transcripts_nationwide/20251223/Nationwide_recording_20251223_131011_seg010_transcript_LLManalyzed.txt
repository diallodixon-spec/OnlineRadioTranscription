20251223 131011 And I'm wishing you were here with me Soak with love all my thoughts of you Now that you're gone, I just don't know what to do If only you were here, You'd wash away my tears The sun would shine And once again you'd be mine oh mine When in reality You and I will never be Cause you took your love away from me
