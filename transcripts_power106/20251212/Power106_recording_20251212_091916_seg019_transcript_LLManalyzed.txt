2025-12-12 09:29:05 Central Bank cut its rate to 0.25% per annum on the same day. Global central banks and a holding interest rates firm are cutting them cautiously in order to contain inflation without causing a recession as well as to prevent a run on their currencies in favor of the US dollar. Many investors, analysts and traders believed inflation was peaking and as a result, the Fed should have paused before it did but Professor Summers originally disagreed. We also argue that the current problem related to inflation is similar to the one faced by the late former Fed Chairman Paul A. Volcker, who zapped up the benchmark rate to as high as 20% per annum, and the unemployment rate to 10% during the 1980s, but the scenarios over not played out yet. Professor Summers also stresses that tax increases are under richer imperative if this is to be avoided.
