I want that peace of mind, where they come with that word Baby, now on my wrist, where they run So make you know I'll always die Oh, no, no pressure Make you give me that love If you give me me, I'm not going to let go. Give me, make a girl my zanko. Feelings got me hitting on the freaky dance floor. Make you give me the love.
