20251229 090707 I like We come out to show the body just watch We come out to shell the party, just watch When last you been to a party Plenty women looking so nice We must be in paradise When last you had the time to remember He's only bum but a fender And he drinks a gun, big up the bar, ten men Last you been to a party Girls wakin' up, lookin' naughty And the DJ just drop a tune And the man bust up like wine up on a shawty And the rum just passin' on me head Champagne on me eyes red My boat hands up to the sky, I test it
