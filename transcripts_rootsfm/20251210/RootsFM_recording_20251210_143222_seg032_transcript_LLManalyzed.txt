I don't throw up and every day I'm praying Every day I'm praying we'll never part Bullseye you hit me Right between the eyes with your sweet love What a shot I never got enough Out of the stage what I should do Oh All it took was a syphilis I wasn't caught up and I looked into your eyes Bullseye, you hit me Right between the eyes with your sweet love What a shot, I never got enough
