um, on olympic cycles a cycle was the 2024 olympic questions about it. Th fighters that went through is Daniel Hilton and, um, had the opportunity to ter before Daniel, you know, he professional. He's been and hurdles to get over. And I think the time is right for him now, you know, to make his professional debut. So as of, you know, based off of the crop that's out there, the crop is that deep, but then the crop is, this is the cream of the crop. You know, the cream always rises to the top. Other fighters have turned professional before Daniel, but I think Daniel Hilton and Jerome Ennis are the best two fighters, if you have any questions about it, from the 2024 crop up of Jamaican fighters. Alright, Sakeema, thank you very much for being on the show once again.
