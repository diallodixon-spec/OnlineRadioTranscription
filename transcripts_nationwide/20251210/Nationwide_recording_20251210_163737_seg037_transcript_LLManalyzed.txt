They never knew a rat's have the prettiest car Toothpunch, all kind of roots in a wee bar Everything's straight where you sit in a wee place Cause you can't shake it in a sila, see how it far No purpose to you, they need to know this Some burn and raise and some are tourist Them a go on like say rats now have fun Shall list a place from sun up to sundown Yeah, everything gonna blow They be rats the way so me say me grow. Fresh like water on the cross, we're not green like the prince and princess, kings and queens. Every day is Christmas Every day is Christmas Who was a freak at the party? Who was a freak?
