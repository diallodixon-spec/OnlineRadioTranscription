20251217 132817 today. Who do you listen to? I used to dream of being rich. I have a lot of houses and cars. so take a look inside yourself you realize you're really blessed no matter how you're sad and blue there's always someone who has it worse than you Sometimes you gotta pay your dues So don't worry, just push on through Keep it in real Gotta dig up all my people who be working on the future Though they know they gotta struggle Keep it in real So all my people's working on the 95 And doing right to keep themself apart
