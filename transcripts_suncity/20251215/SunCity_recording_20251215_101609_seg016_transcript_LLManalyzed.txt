20251215 101609 Imagine if we never do what we do. The people then would have dead. No sir. Boy, well that food didn't cover hardly anybody. It probably covered a couple of communities because I'm trying to find these people. Like somebody, especially we're all talking about it. Somebody come out and say, no man, me get things. But maybe the reason why nobody's really coming out is because it is still, people are still politic this situation so it could be that to that PNP people get stuff and they're not gonna speak on it depending on where you know they get stuff people are gonna behave like they didn't because we know that this is also a thing that's why I'm saying I'm so aware of even having a conversation about it because it's never going to be a conversation where people are trying to unite and get the job done and solve the problem. It's more like, see, see, they might take out of that or she had to go to that other government not take out of that. And I'm kind of over that, you know, we need to help the people we do.
