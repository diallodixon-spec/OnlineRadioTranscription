20251212 213820 There's no darling Make me sweat, make me harder Make me lose my breath. Make me water. Make me sweat, make me harder, make me lose my breath, make me water. Normally, I could keep my cool, but tonight I'm whining. I'm a beat, yeah. In a dangerous mood, can you match my timing? Telling me That you're really about it, why'd you hide it?
