20251226 212824 Sometimes I just forget to say things I might regret. It breaks my heart to see you crying. I don't want to lose you. I could never make it alone. I am a man who fights for your honor I'll be the hero you're dreaming of We'll live forever knowing together that we did it all for the glory of love You keep me standing tall
