20251225 190003 They gon' give me your lolo-lo-lo-lolo-lolo-lo I see this fine girl from my party, she wear yellow Every other girl did they do too much but this girl mellow Now you might find situation I could use to tell I'm mellow Finally I find way to talk to the girl but she ain't no one follow Who you gonna phone for? Why you no one call for? Then I start to feel a bum bum Because she didn't give me smile smile I know she said people sit down one one But she feelin' insecure Cause her friends go they got my lighting on They got my lighting on Yeah I know I look sharp but for you I can't tell no And my hips make you cry when I'm moving around you Do it once, do it twice Heartbeats spark, you hold me tight Get a taste for a night Baby show me you can calm down, calm down Dance with me and take the lead now, lead now Got you so high that you can't calm down
