discussion with Elder Samaro Manning, he's Elder's Quorum President of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, the Montego Bay branch. Now, in terms of, because you know, by the way Elder Manning, welcome back, and I'm thinking about persons now from different backgrounds, different walks of life. How does the, or how do the activities under the Light the World initiative bring said people together that are coming from different backgrounds, different walk of life? It's a great question. So the fact, even though we are from different backgrounds, we are all humans, we all have experiences. So, in a time like this, when some of us can do a lot, some of us can't do a little, what we can do is unite and join together, no matter where we are from. Understanding once again that we are brothers and sisters.
