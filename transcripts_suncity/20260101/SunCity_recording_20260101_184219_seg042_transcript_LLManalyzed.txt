20260101 184219 It's the most frustrating thing when you're listening to music. You have to let it out, man. Make a neighbor of them say, yo, what's going on over there, sir? Why are you making so much noise? As a matter of fact, the neighbor might even say, yo, you know what, let me listen to what you're listening to. Yeah, yeah. Let me listen to what your listening to. Nothing wrong if you disturb people, you know, because you're enjoying yourself. All right. Nothing is wrong with that. All right. Yeah. Don't tell them some news. So they'll hear. You're definitely on your own if they come after you. But still, at least it would be worth it. Reed, shout out to you. Got it locked in. Reed says, wishing you a year filled with happiness, good health and exciting new opportunities. May 2026 bring you success in your goals, lots of fun moments and great memories with the people you care about. To the Sun City family.
