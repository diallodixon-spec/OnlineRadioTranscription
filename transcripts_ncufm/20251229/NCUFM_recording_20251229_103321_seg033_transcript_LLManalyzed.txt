20251229 103321 Yeah. And what is one thing that you've wanted to do? A hobby you've been struggling to finally start. Decide on that. Decide on at least one hobby you want to develop for 2026 and stick to it. Getting to know yourself means spending time with yourself and trying new things. Whatever it is that you want to finish or cancel or begin before the new year, the time is now. You don't have time to wait until January 1st. A part of adulting is to know when to begin and to know when to end.
