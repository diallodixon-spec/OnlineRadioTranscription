20251218 212918 When the snow is glistening on the trees outside And all the stockings are hung by the fireside Waiting for Santa to arrive And all the love will show Cause everybody knows It's Christmas time and all the kids will see The gifts under the tree. It's the best time of year for the family. It's a wonderful feeling when the love ain't a room from the floor to the ceiling. It's that time of year. Christmas time is here. And with the blessings from above, God sent you his love. And everything's OK. Merry Christmas, happy holidays. Oh, yeah. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Happy holidays. Oh.
