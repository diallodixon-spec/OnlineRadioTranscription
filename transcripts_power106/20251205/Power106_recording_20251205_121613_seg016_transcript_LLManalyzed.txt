The draw for the 2026 World Cup will take place this afternoon in Washington D.C. in the USA, where the 42 nations are shored of their group placings at the FIFA showpiece. A newly introduced seeding system ensures that the current top four in the world, Spain, Holders Argentina, 2022 runners-up France and England, cannot meet until the semi-final stage if they win their groups. The 48 teams, including six still to be decided playoff winners, will be divided into 12 groups of four to produce a mammothoth 104 match schedule across 16 cities in the USA, Canada and Mexico. Jamaica's Rugby Boys are among the 6 playoff winners yet to be decided and have been placed in Pathway 1 of the FIFA Intercontinental Playoffs
