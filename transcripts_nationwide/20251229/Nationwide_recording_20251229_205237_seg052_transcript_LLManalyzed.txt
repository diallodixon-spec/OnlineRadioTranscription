20251229 205237 I want to be so deep that you believe me When you're lying in her bed And you're in her arms instead of mine, love As you feel her tightening grip Like a genie, I will stick in your heart I won't give up, won't give up Don't give up, don't give up Like the notes here in this song I wanna be inside of you, oh darlin' Oh, I wanna be so deep that you can be with me Inside out Over and over again I wanna be Inside out
