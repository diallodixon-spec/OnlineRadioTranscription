Simon, good afternoon. How are you? I'm good. What's on your mind today? I was listening to you this morning on Ralston, and I can say this about you. I don't know you that much, but it seems like the way you grow up and the way how you live your life, you're a very straightforward and disciplined man, and I respect you for that. I do know about all of that, but make your point. The Jamaican Prime Minister, the way how he's behaving, the company that I work for, I have 10 boss I have to deal with, 10 boss. And when I go into a meeting with them, every one of them have to talk to me with respect, right? Nobody can disrespect me and I can't disrespect them. If I disrespect them, I don't have a job, okay? And I can tell the Jamaican Prime Minister, he can behave that way to the Jamaican parliamentary colleagues and in the Jamaican parliament.
