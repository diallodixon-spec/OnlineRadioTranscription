============================================================

The new silhouette. You see me in the street and I was moving correct. Been running around trying to do the home run. Left that girl, she was no fun. I tie one, smoke one. Big Chief Skeppy and I answer to no one. Counting my blessings, I'm feeling special. Birds eye view, SK level. Give them the shaku when I dance with the devil. Young fella Kuti, the return of the rebel. I told her I need some space. Real busybody, never stay in one one place And she knows I got more tricks under my sleeve That's why she never wants me to leave Stay on the road, ride that energy Stay far away, make you stay far away Just gimme love for the night, gimme love For the night, got to waste no time
