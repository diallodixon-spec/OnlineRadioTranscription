20251222 153420 Hello Melissa I'm sorry. You're okay. We didn't hear you at the start of your response. You can start over please I was saying that the festive season is upon us and that can be a lot some of us where many have and So during the Christmas season we are trying to make Christmas magical for everyone else that sometimes we forget about ourselves. And so there is this belief that busyness equals productivity because of how we were cultured. And so we have to take some time to rest and appreciate the fact that not because we rest, we are not lazy. So busyness is not equal to success and inactivity is not equal to laziness. Yes, very much so.
