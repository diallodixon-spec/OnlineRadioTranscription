It's so good. Keep it steady, never stop. Keep it flowing further up. So do you, look on the roof. Mama, your effort is enough. Seven days I do. Girl, when you're tired, you keep it up. She glorious, she marvelous, she fabulous. She humorous, she never bluff. Touch me harder than you know the head of us. Mama, thank you very much. Made you overfill your cup. And I pray every day that your struggle turn to dust, baby. For it's me, say come hear me.
