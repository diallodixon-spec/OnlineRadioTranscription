20251212 124422 If I broke down my business, I shall know it go right, all I care for the night. If you want to take I'm serious, I'll do it all speed. No need to resonate, I'm on a different frequency. I know it's not necessary, I be down with somebody that could do like like me When I be like Musala coming up the right wing I call to your defender, if you're not careful If you're nice, you know you send me a message But I don't care where I go If you got money pass you If you're not careful I've been messing If I broke down my business I'ma shine your ego bright too All I care for tonight too
