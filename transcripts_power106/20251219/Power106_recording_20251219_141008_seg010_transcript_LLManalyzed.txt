20251219 141008 I was diagnosed with schizophrenia and I was taking psychotic medications that were giving me adverse side effects. So I turned to natural herbs and spices to heal myself. There the spices were born. That is absolutely amazing. Now, although you were focused on the spices, I see you have some shirts here as well. This would make some lovely Christmas gifts. Yes, I'm a graphic designer by profession. That is wonderful. So what kind of prices are we talking about here? Those people who are listening to us on the radio and want them to come on down and get some of these shirts for Christmas gifts, how much money do they must carry with them? Okay, we are fairly affordable. The female t-shirts are for $1,500 and the males it's for $2,000. All right, thank you so very much Judean for supporting us here at the farmers market and I hope you can
