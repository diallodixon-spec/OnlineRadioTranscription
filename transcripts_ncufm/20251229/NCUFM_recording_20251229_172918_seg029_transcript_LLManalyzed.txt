20251229 172918 very agitated. Please be advised I'm approaching the vehicle now. Why did you stop me? I didn't do anything. It was that moron up there who pulled in front of me. He didn't even use his turn signal. Ma'am, please keep your hands in plain sight and hand me your license. Slowly. Fine. Here. Mrs. Smith and your vehicle registration. What for? I didn't anything wrong. Your registration, please. Oh, hang on. Let me find it. Here. Oh, I see you own this vehicle. Of course I own this car. Why did you pull me over? You have a Jesus' Lord and a WWJD bumper sticker on your car when I saw you yelling obscenities and such at that other driver. I naturally assumed the car was stolen. My mistake. Have a nice day. Do people see Jesus in you? Another message from Lifeline Productions, located on the web at lifelinepro.com.
