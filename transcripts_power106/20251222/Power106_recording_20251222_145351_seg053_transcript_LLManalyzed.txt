If that's what they want to sell it to you for, they can. If you want to negotiate with them, no problem. When you're buying chattels too, what we usually do is we can do a separate agreement. So we have an agreement for sale for the land and the building itself. And we'll have a separate agreement called a chattel agreement where we list the chattels and we state the sale price. And of course, what usually happens, similar with land, with buildings that you're buying, you take the chattels as is, you take the furniture as is.
