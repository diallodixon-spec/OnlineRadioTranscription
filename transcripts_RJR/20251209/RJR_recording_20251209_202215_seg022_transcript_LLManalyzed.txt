As it travels with the red of the rest of the blood supply and it goes through the vein towards the heart It is going to encounter Larger and larger blood vessels as it's getting closer and closer to the heart So it will not block up any blood vessels before it gets to the heart. Do you see how that makes sense? You want me to say it again for those who not be hearing. So if I have a clot in my leg, and that clot now breaks free and is traveling through my vein to go towards my heart, remember, as you go closer to the heart, the blood vessel gets bigger and bigger. So if there was a clot in your leg, the size of the blood vessel in your leg will be much smaller than the size of blood vessel as it gets closer to your heart. So any clot in your leg will also be smaller than the blood vessels as it gets closer and closer to your heart
