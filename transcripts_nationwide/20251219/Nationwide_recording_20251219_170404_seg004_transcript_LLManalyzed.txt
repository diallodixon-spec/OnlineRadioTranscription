20251219 170404 The rating is a step down from the positive outlook S&P Global gave to Jamaica after upgrading the country's global credit rating to double B in September. S&P Global says despite Hurricane Melissa delivering a significant hit to Jamaica's growth in the near term and a need to fund rebuilding, the country's solid institutions and preparedness for external shocks, in addition to an expected economic rebound, support the current rating. The agency notes that the stable outlook balances its expectation that the government will prudently manage the recovery and rebuilding efforts guided by a stable institutional foundation with Jamaica's inherent vulnerabilities to external shocks. S&P Global explains that the revision to stable reflects its view that the likelihood that Jamaica's credit worthiness could further strengthen within the next year.
