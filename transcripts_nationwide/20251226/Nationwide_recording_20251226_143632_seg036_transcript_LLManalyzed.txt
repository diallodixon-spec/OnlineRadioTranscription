20251226 143632 Girl, speaking and speaking, see your world Girl, tell them it's a girl, tell them no one in this world Girl's down and girl's all around Girl, bring them on the tempo Bring them truth is clear I think she knew what I wanted to hear Standin' around like a wheel on fire Walkin' on top of a love tiger The fatal attraction is where I'm at There's no escaping me I just wanna be close to you You are the things you want me to I just wanna be closer to you
