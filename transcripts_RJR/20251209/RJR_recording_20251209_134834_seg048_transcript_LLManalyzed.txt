We're back on the ToonLive crew. Remember to update those birthdays and anniversaries. We want to meet my friend Deli, had some very great time, photo and music wise. Good to hear your voice, Badrin. Lloyd Brooks, photographer from cross-country, et cetera. Give you a big shout out to him. I'll leave all the numbers here, so you don't know. Can't link him when you're ready. You understand? Yeah, man. Desiree not talking. She said Bounty Killer is a king. Agent Sasco is a king. Yeah, they're all kings in their own right, right? But we didn't talk about who is on the top of Mount Everest right now dance hall-wise. That's got to be Vibes Cartel. There's no doubt about that. The numbers and the appeal will say that. But you know who else is on Mount Rushmore? Like everybody, Mount Rushmore.
