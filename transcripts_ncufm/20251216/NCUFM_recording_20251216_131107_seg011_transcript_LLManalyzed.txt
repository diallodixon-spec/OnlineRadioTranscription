Save us, save us, save us now. Take away the pressure, don't make me bow. We can't do nothing if you're not speed. The heart is willing, but the flesh is weak. God, please save us. Save us. Save us now, take away the pressure. Don't make me bow, save us. It ain't been you. God, we can't survive without you. Save us now, take away the pressure, don't make me fall, take my life and make me new, cause we can't survive without you. Save us, save us now. Take away the pressure. Don't make me fall. We can't do a thing if we don't speak. The heart is withered by the passion's beat. Oh, my heart is withered.
