As I told the other drivers that came in, if you are here and you're like, oh my gosh, I came in and I didn't have a thing. Don't worry yourself. There's a beautiful store here on location and if you just pop in, if you don't want to come out to the car to stick up your hand, we'll come get the money and we will go in and buy something non-perishable for you and we're going to drop it right into the barrel. I tell you, there's nothing great like knowing that you made a difference in the life of a child and that's what Barita and Fesco are doing today. With me is business development manager for Future Energy Source Company Limited, Fesco Howard Cox. Hey Howard, how are you doing? I am good. How are you? I am great. Thank you so much for having us. Tell me, why did FESCO come on board for this initiative? So, FESCO has always been about serving the communities. We have stations located all across the island, so that's something that we do in every community that we're located.
