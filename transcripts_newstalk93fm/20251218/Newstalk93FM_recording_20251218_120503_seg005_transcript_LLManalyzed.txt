20251218 120503 When these people don't know what you been through You survive through the night Through the darkest of times It's only, got you feelin' like you made it Everything advanced, nothin' that I do is basic Me and Rolls Royce on a first-name basis Look up with no chases Only give her hunnits cause she hates seein' new faces Know she wanna mine by the stones in her bracelet Lil' money, be a hollerin' down station She told me to pay for it, now she backin' it up Used to date a Bob player, but they wrappin' it up Got her in a penthouse and I'm smack smacking it up. They gonna point you to the top if you asking for us. 21. Go ahead, it's your time baby. It's your time baby, get my baby. That's the difference when you're my baby, that's how it is when you. Nobody make me stop the world.
