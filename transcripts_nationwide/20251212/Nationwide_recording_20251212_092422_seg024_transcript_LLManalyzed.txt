2025-12-12 09:33:40 We are getting our parents back in line. Our teachers too. We have started to pick up the pieces and we are ready to run again. And finally, for those who are listening who may be able to offer any assistance, what are your immediate needs? Alright, so our immediate needs are for students. Currently, they would have lost uniform, shoes, you know, books, their school supplies. Um parents needing support as well at home. Um some are still without roof. You know, so we are looking at that on the and and the side of the school at school. I think the support will come for us. Um so that we can pick up the piece but I'm really concerned because if the students are not okay when they return it is going to be a challenge for us so I really want to ensure that the parents and the students are okay they can get back to school they can get back in that comfortable space they can find the money to send them back home
