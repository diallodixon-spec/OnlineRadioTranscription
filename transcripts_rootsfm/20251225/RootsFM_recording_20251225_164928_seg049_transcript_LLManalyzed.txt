I'm telling me till your mother in my memory falls. Telling me till your mother hollering at us. I'm telling her till you know they're my one disciple. Say, say, say, they're my judge and disciple. They want to learn, they want a lover, they're no singer, they're no player, they're no instrument They say they're jaja disciple I see them coming from the Amharic temple
