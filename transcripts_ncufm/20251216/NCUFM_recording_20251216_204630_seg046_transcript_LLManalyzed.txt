20251216 204630 United in Jesus Christ We are the soldiers of the land We don't rest on flesh and blood But bring the palaties of the dark We too are marching to unbeat Brushing the enemy under our feet We are mighty in our stand With God's Word in our hands In our hearts we have a vision We have made our decision To show the Father's love With great power from above We are united in Christ. We are the soldiers of the light. We don't rest on flesh and blood, but bring the palaties of the dark. We too are marching to one week.
