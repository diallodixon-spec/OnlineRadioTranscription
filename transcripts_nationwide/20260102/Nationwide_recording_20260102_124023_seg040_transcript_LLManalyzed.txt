20260102 124023 I was strong as I could be I go out They say the holy water's watered down And this town's lost its faith Our colors will fade eventually So if our time is running out Day after day We'll make the moonlight our masterpiece Oh my my, oh my my love I take a look at you, you're taking me out of the ordinary I want you laying down to the dead of night On the edge of night Steady and talk a lot The angels up in the clouds Are just knocking down Something so loud will be heard today You're gonna be kissing the ground of a sanctuary
