20251229 115836 That's a good way to end this show today. So thank you again, Dr. Andrea Daly, Diabetes Educator, for sharing with us a checklist as to how we are able to manage our diabetes. Remember, review all your medications early. Plan for your travel. Monitor your blood sugar regularly. Adjust your medication timing if there's a need for that. If you have eaten too much or eaten too little, make sure you make that adjustment. Stay hydrated and limit your alcohol. This has been a very good show Dr. Daily and we want to thank you again. Thanks also to Aaron and Isis and Dwight and Dr. Bishop Michael Webster and all the listeners who have tuned in. For the year 2025 it is beyond the prescription and I'm your host Dr. Stephanie Mullin. See you in 2020.
