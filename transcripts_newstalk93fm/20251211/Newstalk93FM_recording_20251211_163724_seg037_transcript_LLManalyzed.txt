2025-12-12 10:22:04 It's over, it's over, so f*** it Just don't act like my love wasn't nothing Like I wasn't the one you was holding that night Telling all of your secrets and hugging Guess you're right, it's too good to be true What's important, all I needed was you But time after time, I just fussing and fighting It's time that you do what you do And it's cool Mama said it was fish in the sea, I got lost in the pool Knew it was coming, I watched how you moved How you turn leave me baby go and leave me all the way. Don't ask for all your things back cussing out my name, yeah, just to go and take back what you say. Burn all the bridges. Don't ask forgiveness.
