============================================================

You wanna give me my blessing So, child, I know you wanted to live you. No other one but you. In Sun City, baby. You're so, so good. So good. Me need what me saying from the heart. Baby girl, me and you would never part. Girl, me say you have me in a comfort zone. Every time you leave me, then you come back home. B&B and the games we are playin'. I and I would have never ever strayed. Girl, me say you lock me in your comfort zone. Get me solid as a rock, you know me tough like stone. I believe that love is a powerful weapon.
