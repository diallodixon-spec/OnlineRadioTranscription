20251226 160507 Never gonna let you down Never gonna run around and desert you Never gonna make you cry Never gonna say goodbye Never gonna say goodbye and hurt you We've known each other for so long Your heart's been aching but You're too shy to say it's sad We both know what's been going on We know the game and we're gonna play it I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling Gotta make you understand it Never gonna give you up Never gonna let you down
