============================================================

Won't you let an innocent woman be? Never hurt or self-care Half your brain just ain't fair Let you out While you always come running Taking all my loving from me I like my boys playing hard to get And I like my men all incompetent And I swear they me. I'm not choosing them, amen. Amen. Hey, man. Hey, man! Mitchell, why you always come running on me? Always come running on me.
