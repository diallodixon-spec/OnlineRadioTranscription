============================================================

There are a few things, but one of the things that really comes to mind right now is when you're doing something like this on your own and there's not really a rule book exactly of what you should do to be successful. And sometimes you might want somebody to just tell you exactly what to do to make the right decision to get the end result that you want. It's like you kind of have to realize that maybe you just need to trust yourself a bit more. Of course you lean on others for advice, but what's challenging sometimes is knowing if what you're doing is the right thing or the right direction and maybe you won't know until you try it. That's a bit challenging but you learn to work through that and just try and be willing to fail in order to learn and move forward.
