20251217 180103 for the opener when Brentford were denied what they felt should have been a red card. Abdelkader Koussanov was only booked for tripping Kevin Shaday as he broke through on goal, with the absence of VAR leaving the on-field decision to stand. After the break, Nico O'Reilly tested goalkeeper Mark Flecken with a long-range effort, while at the other end James Trafford produced a fine save to deny Christopher Aher. City eventually sealed the result on 67 minutes when Savino's deflected strike looped over the keeper, saving four spot kicks as PSG claimed their sixth trophy of a remarkable year. The Champions League winners struck first through Kavica Kovaratshkelia seven minutes before halftime.
