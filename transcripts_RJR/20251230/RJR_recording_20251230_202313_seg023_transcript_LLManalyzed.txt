20251230 202313 This love is so high We can't get over it, no, no With feelings so wide We can't get around When we trust in the powers of the most high We'll be satisfied, baby Forsaking all confusion Mixed with foolish pride For the rest of my years I'll be here standing by your side and always doing good to those who would take me for a ride this love is so high we can't get over it no no we're feeling so wide we can't get around our mind needs to be at home to see his children grow exhorting truths and rights and watch the vibes flow now if i should lose this feeling
