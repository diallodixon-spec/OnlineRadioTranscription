============================================================

I woke up this morning, and I'm feeling nice. But the path that I chose comes with battles to fight. As long as I'm living, my future is shaping. And where I am heading Got no time for problems All the weight on your shoulder Put the problems behind you If you fall down let's get up and Get your heads off the dirt and When they try to badmine you Handle talking behind you Don't let nothing bother you Put your hand in the air and Everybody It's time to get up and start moving. Leaving all your problems behind. We're pressing on to our victory.
