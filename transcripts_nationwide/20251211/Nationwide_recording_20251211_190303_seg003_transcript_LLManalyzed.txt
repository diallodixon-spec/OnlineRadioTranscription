2025-12-11 19:12:42 Welcome back listeners, viewers. We now turn to Australia, where on Wednesday, that country became the first to ban social media for children under the age of 16, blocking access in a move welcomed by many parents and child advocates but criticized by major technology companies and free speech advocates. Starting at midnight on Tuesday, 10 of the largest platforms including TikTok, YouTube, Instagram and Facebook were ordered to block children or face fines of up to AU$49.5 million under the new law which is being closely watched by regulators worldwide. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese called it a proud day for families and cast the law as proof that policy makers can curb online harms that have outpaced traditional safeguards.
