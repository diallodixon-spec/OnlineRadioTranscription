20251222 200706 They come for me When people lie You provide a way out So I can smile That's why I can't give up Look how far you've carried me Can't give up You give me strength when I am weak Can't give up Cause as far as I can see Can't give up With every breath that's left in me Victory, my God, my God. Victory, my God. My God, my God, how you love me. Victory, victory, my God.
