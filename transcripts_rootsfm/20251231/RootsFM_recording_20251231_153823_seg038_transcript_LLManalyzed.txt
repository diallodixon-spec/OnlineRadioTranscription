20251231 153823 Baby girl, I was tired So I lay down to dream for a little while But lately I've been so, so uninspired Take your time, take your time to go Have the comfort of your smile But I'm the comfort of your smile. But I'm not complaining. Cause that's how it goes. There's always some holiday. Everything goes as it's supposed to. But you can't avoid it.
