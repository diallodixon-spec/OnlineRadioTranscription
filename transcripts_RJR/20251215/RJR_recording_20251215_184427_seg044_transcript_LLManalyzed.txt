20251215 184427 A quick comment on about 30 seconds. Faye Ellington's question. Should the government be helping people in the entertainment industry? Given all the cancellations. Sir Simpson, what do you think? Absolutely. So I want to say this. I want to make it clear that I don't believe it is the government's duty to lift, to lift the entertainment industry. The industry must lift itself. But I also believe that as it's government's duty, the leadership, the signals, and all of those things are also critical. Optics is important, optics is important on either side. So remember now, the entertainment industry was the last to receive any kind of aid during COVID. It was one of the first to be hit because of how it operates. It operates on people gathering together in the main. I'm so sorry. I have to interrupt you because we're right upon to sports. Fascinating discussion. Gentlemen, we thank you so much for your time and your thoughts.
