============================================================

The angels up in the clouds are jealous, know what we found Something so heavenly, higher than ecstasy Whenever you're next to me Oh mama Where was it black and white Until I saw your light I thought you had to die to avoid Something so out of the ordinary I want you laying me down To a dead and buried? On the edge of your night, staying drunk on your vibe. The angels up in the clouds are jealous knowing we found service to our ordinary. You got me kissing the crow, crow sings you out.
