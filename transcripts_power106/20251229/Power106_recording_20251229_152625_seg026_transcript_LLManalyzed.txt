20251229 152625 title. Just a comment, Ms. Finlay. I think the government needs to do something about all these developments in Kingston, especially the apartment complexes. There are just too many of them, boy. I take that point, especially in the corporate area. Kingston 6, Kingston 8, I think to some extent, yeah, Kingston 10 also. Sometimes it seems that there is a new development on every corner. You know, I have some places I'm driving by and I feel like I drive past those places every day and I just look up all of a sudden and I see a new multi-story building. There are pros and cons, you know. They always say that once you see developments going up, it means the economy is doing well. I'm sure many persons may not agree with that. But yeah, there are a lot of apartments around, and I know in particular the two-bedroom apartments, even though there are lots of them, quite a few of them, you know.
