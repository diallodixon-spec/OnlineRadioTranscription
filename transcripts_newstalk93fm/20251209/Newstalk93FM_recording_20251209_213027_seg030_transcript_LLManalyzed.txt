============================================================

The angels up in the clouds are jealous, know what we've found Something so heavenly, higher than ecstasy Whenever you're next to me, oh mama Where we see black and white, until I saw your light I thought you had to die to a dead and buried? on the edge of your night staying drunk on your vibe The angels up in the clouds are jealous knowing we found something so out of the ordinary. You got me kissing the proud, proud sanctuary. Trying to be what you're taught. Oh, Lord, return me to dust. The angels up in clouds are jealous.
