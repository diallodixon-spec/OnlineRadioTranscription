20251225 144024 Jesus came for me Majesty and weakness Hope and poverty Glory wrapped in swaddling clothes Mercy from above Jesus in a manger The miracle of love Every tear I've ever cried He carried even on that day He was born for my redemption Born to lead me in His way Now His glory glory fills my spirit, now His peace restores my heart. Glory wrapped in swaddling cloths, a brand new life to start.
