So just wait a little while And a little time to pray to the most high But patience is the last thing on my mind Better must come one day Living in a tenement yard Got those bills to pay, better must come one day The righteous anointed to the most high I pray The race is not for the sweet My youth possibly won Please don't forfeit It's not how you start. It's how you finish my people. Everything takes a little time. So just wait a little while. And a little time I pray to the moon sky. But patience is the last thing on my mind And every day it's a little tight So just wait a little while And a little time I pray to the moon's light But patience is the thing on my mind
