The 48-year-old who twice turned on the opportunity to ride in the lucrative event said he was hell-bent on delivering a solid performance which he managed to achieve. I don't want to be disappointed. The environment twice I denied because I have a commitment to ride the horses in New York. Now it worked out beautiful, perfect, the right time, the right place. I hooked up with the horse and how beautiful to win the biggest race here in Jamaica. Like any sport, it's mental. It's really mental. You have to be positive and you have to go race by race. You can be disappointed. Don't get me wrong. I was a little frustrated. I'm very competitive, you know. But never give up. Our heart, positive and try to end it up to the bigger races here in Jamaica. And an update in the Jamaica Premier League game, Cavalier, Champions Cavalier.
