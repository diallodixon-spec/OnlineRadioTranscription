This year was really overwhelming, but when I see how you know what you do and the passion you have to what you have done To resurrect the place again With you know without getting really despondent and saying oh we can't do this again all this is not going to happen again You just got to it. I want to know from you Theo and Sharon Chambers. What is it that?els you to keep doing this, even though at home you still don't have light, water or connectivity? What drives you? I would say for me, I have come to the conclusion that my happiness, longevity and good health lies only one place, among the trees, the birds, and great oxygen, not polluted by car, by airplane. Let me tell you.
