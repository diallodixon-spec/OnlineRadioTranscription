20251218 184118 You're welcome. That's not like something you'd like to be a part of. It sounds great. You're welcome, Alicia. You're welcome. Here So technically, it's a toy drive. We're focusing on toys this Christmas, because even though they are displaced without homes, at least they have something to look forward to. So if you want to donate and you're willing to donate, you can come to the Uemura Guild office, so that's at Students Union, and you can drop off toys. And if you don't want to do that, they're having a benefit concert, which is this Sunday. It is $3,000 for a ticket. You can either drop off at the event, or you can come in and drop off. So if you're interested, you can either drop off, or you come to the event and drop off. OK, that sounds fun to me.
