20251215 140305 after climbing from outside the top 300 to world number 18. Moving over to basketball as LeBron James delivered another vintage performance as the Los Angeles Lakers edged the Phoenix Suns 116-114 in a dramatic NBA showdown on Sunday. James scored 26 points and was central to a chaotic finish that saw emotions spill over late in the fourth quarter. The Lakers appeared in control after opening a 20-point lead, but Phoenix stormed back and briefly took a one-point advantage with just 12 seconds remaining, following a three-pointer from Dillon Brooks. Moments later, Brooks collided with James, earning his second technical fall off the night and an automatic ejection. Although James missed the ensuing technical free throw, he was followed by Devin Booker on a three-point attempt and calmly converted two of three free throws with three seconds left to restore the Lakers lead. The 40-year-old also contributed four points, three rebounds, and capped the night by blocking Grayson Allen's potential game-winning three at the buzzer.
