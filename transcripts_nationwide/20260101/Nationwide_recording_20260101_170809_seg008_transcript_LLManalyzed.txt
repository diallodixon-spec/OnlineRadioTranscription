20260101 170809 I would meet someone so beautiful I never thought I'd see a love like this Tonight I'll show you that I love this song and beautiful And I'll seal it with a kiss Long and lasting love We share for many reasons A special bond that goes beyond The changing of the seasons Long and lasting love Long and lasting love Someone I can care for Someone to be loved
