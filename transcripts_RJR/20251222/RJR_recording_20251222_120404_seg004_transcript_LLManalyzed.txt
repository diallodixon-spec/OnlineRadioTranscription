20251222 120404 Surpassing the total number of recorded deaths for all of 2024, there were 365 deaths from 315 collisions last year. The Island Traffic Authority says the 366 deaths, as at December 22, represent a 3% increase over the same period last year, when 356 fatalities were recorded. Two single-vehicle crashes in Manchester yesterday, where a private motorcar passenger and a motorcycle driver died, have contributed to the upward movement in the year-to-date figures for 2025. Vice Chairman of the National Road Safety Council, Dr. Lucian Jones, says the most at-risk group is motorcyclists, 111 of whom have died this year. He is called for the resumption of a motorcyclist training program, which was discontinued as a means of reducing fatalities. Dr. Jones says deaths among private motorcar passengers have increased this year.
