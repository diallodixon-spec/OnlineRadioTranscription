20260101 110705 I know that everything could change And I know that my life would never be the same You're the only one that's making sense to me When I close my eyes, you're the one I see There's no other way I could ever be without you babe Now everything I do is over loving you It's not something that we're used to No other way to say I need you everyday And now I'm gonna change my ways And it's a part of you I never wanna lose I'll do anything you want me to Like any other day I know I'll find a way And if ever I'm alone you'll say I'll be thinkin' bout you I'll be thinking bout you
