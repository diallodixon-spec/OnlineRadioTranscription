Join me, Liseth Martin, on NCUFM as we read the Holy Bible one chapter each day, Sunday to Sabbath, 5.30 a.m. with a repeat at 9.30 p. Meatloaf? Ew, your meatloaf could gag a camel. Excuse me? Oh, wait. Can I erase those words? Meatloaf? Oh, OK. Do we have any ketchup? Wouldn't it be great if we could erase all of the words we wish we hadn't said? Jensen, I've reviewed your work on the Smith account. Yes, sir. I've worked hard on that, sir. Well, it stinks. Sir? Hold it. Let's try that again. Okay, take two. Good work, Jensen. One suggestion. Try making that report a little shorter. Unfortunately, real life doesn't give us the opportunity to take back our words. Nice party, boss. Thanks, Jensen. But there are sure some weird-looking people here.
