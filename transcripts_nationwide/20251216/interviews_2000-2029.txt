**Interview with Dr. Andre McDonald on Knee Pain**

In a recent episode of the radio program "Prescription for Life" on Nationwide 90FM, host George sat down with Dr. Andre McDonald, a certified sports medicine specialist, to discuss the often-misunderstood topic of knee pain. The conversation was both informative and surprising, as Dr. McDonald revealed that knee pain can be caused by a variety of factors, including sexually transmitted infections such as gonorrhea.

Dr. McDonald shared a personal anecdote from his time in medical school, where he encountered a young man with knee pain who was later diagnosed with gonococcal arthritis, a condition caused by the spread of gonorrhea to the joints. This experience taught Dr. McDonald the importance of considering non-traumatic causes of knee pain, particularly in young people.

The discussion also delved into the structure and function of the knee joint, with Dr. McDonald explaining the various components that can be affected by injury or disease, including cartilage, tendons, ligaments, and fat pads. He emphasized the complexity of the knee joint and the challenges of diagnosing knee pain, which can be caused by a multitude of factors, including overuse, trauma, and underlying medical conditions.

One of the most striking aspects of the conversation was the revelation that knee pain can be referred from other areas of the body, such as the back. Dr. McDonald explained that pain in the knee can sometimes be caused by problems in the lumbar spine, particularly in the L5 and S1 regions. This highlights the importance of taking a thorough medical history and conducting a comprehensive physical examination to determine the underlying cause of knee pain.

Throughout the interview, Dr. McDonald emphasized the importance of patient education and awareness, encouraging listeners to take an active role in understanding their knee health. He also stressed the need for healthcare professionals to approach knee pain with a high index of suspicion, considering a wide range of potential causes and taking the time to listen to patients' concerns.

The conversation was engaging, informative, and at times surprising, making for a compelling listen. As Dr. McDonald noted, "Knee pain is one of the conditions, especially in specialist medicine, that when a patient comes to me for knee pain, the time to talk about it is very important." This interview is a must-listen for anyone interested in learning more about knee pain and its many causes.
