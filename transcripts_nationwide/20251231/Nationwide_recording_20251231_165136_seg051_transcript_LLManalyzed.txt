I know you smell the perfume The makeup on his shirt You don't believe his stories You know that they're all lies Bad as you are, you stick around And I just don't know why If I was your man Baby, you Never worry about What I do I'd be coming home Back to you Every night Doing you right If it's like a woman Served you thanks Missed for the diamonds A handful of rain Baby you're a star I just wanna show you, you are You should let me love you Let me be the one to Give you everything you want and need Baby, good luck with protection Make me your selection Show you the way love's supposed to be Nationwide
