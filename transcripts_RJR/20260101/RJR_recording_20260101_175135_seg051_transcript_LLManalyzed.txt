This is station ZQI Kingston, Jamaica, British West Indies. Then there was the transition to the new successor station. This is Radio Jamaica. On this occasion of Radio Jamaica's first broadcast, we bring you now our inaugural program. And so it was that a new era of broadcasting in Jamaica had begun with the first transmission of Radio Jamaica 75 years ago. Keep listening for more highlights of this proud record of service.
