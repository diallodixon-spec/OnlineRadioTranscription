20251216 155837 Hey, George, did you hear about Bob landing that big sail? Yeah, yeah, sure. Sorry, I got a meeting to go to. But did you hear what else happened to Bob? No! What? You didn't hear what happened to Bob?! No, no, tell me! I thought you said you had a meeting. It's just a meeting with my boss. It can wait. He got caught stealing, didn't he? No. He was drinking on the job, right? You know those sales guys. No. Embezzling? Insider trading? Come on, tell me. What? What? Why are you so interested in hearing this? You didn't have time to hear good news about Bob. That was boring. Now I want to know what happened. Why? Because I'm egotistical and I want to hear bad things about other people to make me feel better about myself. Whoa, that was honest. Yeah, I shouldn't be that way. I wouldn't want others to talk about the bad things I've done. You know, Bob, gossip really isn't good. True. So what happened to Bob? Oh, he bought a new car with the bonus he got.
