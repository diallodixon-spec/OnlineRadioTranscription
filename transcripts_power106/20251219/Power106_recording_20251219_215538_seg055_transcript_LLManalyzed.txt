20251219 215538 I live among the creatures of the night I haven't got the will to try and fight Against a new tomorrow So I guess I'll just believe it Tomorrow never knows I said night I'm living in the forest of a dream I know the night is not as it would seem I must believe in something So I'll make myself believe in That this night will never go You take myself, you take my self control You take myself, You take my self control
