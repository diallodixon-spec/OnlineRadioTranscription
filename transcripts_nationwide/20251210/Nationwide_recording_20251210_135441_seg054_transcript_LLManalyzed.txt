All when I say gal run carnival, what I mean? Everything start when you whine like that. Whole world stop when you whin like that. When I say gal come turn it up, what I mean. Do no hold back when you feel like that. So hot when you do it like that. How will you fling way buckets and fit? All over that waist, girl. Dash way buckets and fit. How will you whine and give me that face? Man try hard for your dirty flex Man try far for your dirty flex Pull up on car for your dirty flex Your dirty flex, for your dirty flex Girl, man, try hard for your dirty flex Fight like dog for your dirty flex Full of big talk for your dirty flex, your dirty flex
