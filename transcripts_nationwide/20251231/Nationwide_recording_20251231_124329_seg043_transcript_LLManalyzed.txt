20251231 124329 Kiss me Out of the bearded barley I'd lay Beside the green, green grass Swing the swings Swing the spinning step You wear those shoes and I will wear that dress Kiss me, beneath the milky twilight Lead me, out on the moonlit floor Lift your open head, strike up the band and make the fireflies dance Till the moon's sparkling So kiss me
