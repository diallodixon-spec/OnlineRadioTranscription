I don't think anybody understand what is going on. I mean Khadija is playing tremendous football right now. Consistently. It's crazy. Remember this is a girl who do all surgery you know. When she went to do the surgery I was like okay she gonna need a little time to recover and to get back. If I never remember she do surgery nobody would remember. Nobody would not remember. Yeah. It's amazing what she's doing. She's just brilliant. She's carrying the team. I mean, some of the British people won't say what I'm saying, but it's true. She's brilliant. She's brilliant right now. Playing some of the best football. Listen, as a striker, she is powerful. I've never seen any striker who can find the ball like Khadija and make space so the ball can find her. A tremendous player. Tremendous player. Big time. Stars make you watch. The stars make you watch the games.
