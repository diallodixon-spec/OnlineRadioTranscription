20251231 191817 I just want to tell the world I see No more chains and loneliness For Christ to set me free Oh, we are more. Through His love, now I can see better. Free, free, free as I am. Free my head. Free to, amen. Someday, we'll know that someday I will smile again and I'm free. Yes, I am free to laugh, free to cry.
