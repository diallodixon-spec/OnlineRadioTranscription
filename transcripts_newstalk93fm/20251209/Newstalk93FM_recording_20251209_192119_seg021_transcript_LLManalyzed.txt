I want you for the dirty and clean I'm not wakin' any dreams With me bite my tongue and make me scream See, I got everything that you need Ain't nobody gon' do it like me We are burnin' out of high degree And you make me feel like it burns And it hurts, uh Baby, this part of the rush This is us What is love? Baby, don't hurt me don't hurt me no more What is love? Baby don't hurt, me don't hurt me No more, what is love?
