20251224 160707 Parish, my parish. You see, that's what I'm talking about. I'm talking about 88%. Yes, yes, but in the worst affected parishes, Westmoreland 88% up to a week ago without Paul. St. Elizabeth 50. That's what they had to do. I tell my parishes instead of just use one brush and you know. All right Richard, cool. All right Sir P, all the very best to your family for the season sir. Same to you. Thank you sir, take care. All right, this is both sides of the story here on Paul 106.
