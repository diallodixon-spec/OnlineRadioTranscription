20251224 144640 at the World Championships. It took a world record pace to beat them. The sprint queens fight until the on its head. Dejaun Whisper Richards dances through the defence and buries it. The goal by Ronaldo Cifas at World Cup Qualifier vs Trinidad and Tobago. Blink and you'll miss him. Ronaldo Cifas turns on the jets, leaves the defence in the dust and fires Jamaica one step closer to the World Cup. Horse racing. I dream again winning the Jamaica Derby. On Independence Day, a dream comes true at Cayman.
