United goes up against Sun City 104.9 FM's Dream Team. The whistle has gone. Supreme Sunday plays the ball to Rewind Monday. Rewind Monday taps the ball to Karen Tze. Karen Tze dribble. He labs it over to Reggae Wednesday. Reggae Wednesday dribble. Left to the right. Left one for dead. Lovers turn as they receive the pass. He chases it, he brings it down on the flank. Passes it to Turner Friday, who turns it up. He turns up the knob on this game. It's Turner Friday! Turner Friday! Passes it to Scotty on Saturday! Oh my word! What a goal! What a goal, it's a Scorter. Oh, my word! It's Radial with the difference! Sun City 1-0, 4x9 of him! They hugged... Yo, I'm Bridgerin'. How you look, sir? I know a star, you know my DNA go in.
