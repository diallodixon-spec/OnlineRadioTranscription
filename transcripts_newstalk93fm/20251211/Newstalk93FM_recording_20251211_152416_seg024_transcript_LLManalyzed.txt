2025-12-12 09:06:51 I've been reckless with my choices Can't seem to get what the point is Life can be rough, can be smooth And not every fact is the truth Advancing, I'll take the liberty. And I'm gonna love you specially, oh. All the love, all the care, then they fade gone. Don't be hard, baby, give it, I gon' love you
