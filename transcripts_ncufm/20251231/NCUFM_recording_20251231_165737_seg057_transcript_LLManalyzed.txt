Watch the giants in your life fall down I never trouble you You come trouble me You think I was all alone But I'm in God's army And if you trouble God's children You've got to pay the price Watch the giants in you light fall down Trouble's all you must pray Night and day, trust God He'll make our way Trouble told you must pray, night and day Trust God
