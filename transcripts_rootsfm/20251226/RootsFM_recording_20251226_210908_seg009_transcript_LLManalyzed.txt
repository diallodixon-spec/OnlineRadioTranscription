20251226 210908 The ocean of blue eyes Searching for an island that's never been found Deeper and deeper into paradise I'm going down to paradise tonight It's gonna be so nice Me and you in the moonlight Shining bright Going down to paradise. No need to pack my bags, it's not that far. It's just inside this room when there's no one around.
