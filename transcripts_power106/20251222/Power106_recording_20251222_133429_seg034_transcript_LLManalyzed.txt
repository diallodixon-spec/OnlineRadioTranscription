20251222 133429 to tell you garbage yes and and and one last point sir i noticed that they're very willing to criminalize the boys exactly but they're not willing to criminalize no she gets counseling counseling yes sir yes siree you you know of it that if a boy is caught with a bag of marijuana yes if a boy's caught to the bag of marijuana a girl is caught to the same bag of marijuana, an adult male or an adult female caught to the back of marijuana, the only one who goes to prison in Jamaica is the boy. The man and the woman will be charged. I want people to look into this and if they think I'm joking, the girl will be counseled, the boy will go to Pitney prison. And then you wonder why the boys are turning to criminals? I am not guessing. I am telling you what people, including people in the legal zone, has been worried about.
