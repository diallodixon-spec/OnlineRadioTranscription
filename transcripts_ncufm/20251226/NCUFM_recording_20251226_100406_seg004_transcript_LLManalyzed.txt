20251226 100406 In the arms of someone who loves you No matter if the distance to your heart is near or far Love bridges the divine Somewhere between two arms There is a room down the hall Where a family sits in silence and they pray They've heard her laugh, their hearts recall The life that was before it slipped away. Then one last peaceful dream begins eternity as she runs into her saviour's warm embrace.
