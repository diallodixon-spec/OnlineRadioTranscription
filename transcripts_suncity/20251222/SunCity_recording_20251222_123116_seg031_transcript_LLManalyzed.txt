20251222 123116 Customs. You know if I stop listening to you say, you ever experience that? Customs not going in your package, suitcase, barrel or cargo unless you will ship the item or the agent stand up right there when they might inspect it. Listen, customs job is to protect the borders, collect revenue and to facilitate trade. Them not collect or store shipment, them inspect it and somebody after present it for inspection. So how customs ever get so much custom then? Tracy, and the customs alone involved in the clearance process even though them we tend to talk about. Look at it this way. Shipment delayed? Talk to your airline agent. Missing items? Talk to your freight forwarder. The charges surprise you now. Call customs. But remember to collect your sign and stamp declaration or C number from your agent.
