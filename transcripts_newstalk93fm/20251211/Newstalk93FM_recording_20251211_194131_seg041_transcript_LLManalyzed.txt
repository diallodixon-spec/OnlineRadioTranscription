2025-12-12 13:45:53 We could post up all the pictures you want. When you're ready, I could overhear. Darling, you could overhear. But we could meet in the middle and start a bacchanal. Play in the middle, hey, what we gonna do now? Jam to a rhythm in the heat, a carnival under the heat, hey. What we gonna do now, start a wine on the net? I say, compromise on the net Baby, spend time on the net Hey, I say, compromise for me Bubble in your bubble B-b-bubble in it's over When I'm feeling under the weather You just make me feel sweet I used to cook proteins with sugar And together we are complete Darling, keep me up Only you alone can put fire back in me
