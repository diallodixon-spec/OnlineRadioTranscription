20251231 134332 Last night I slept alone I stayed at home For the first time since you've been gone, babe No friends to understand To lend a helping hand To ease the greatest pain I've ever known How you walked away so easily Still remains a mystery to me Don't you remember that you promised me Yes, you promised me that you'd never leave, boy But you went away, babe And it's so touching How could you tell?
