O say can you see, by the dawn's early light, What so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming? Whose broad stripes and bright stars through the perilous fight, O'er the ramparts we watched, Glory to the newborn King. To the newborn King, In excelsis Deo. You're listening to Power 106 FM. The time is now 5 45. Making your radio sound better. This is Power, Power 101 FM.
