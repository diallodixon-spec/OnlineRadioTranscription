20251223 195426 I hate my feelings Got no Just the memories And I'm living with the memories Just the People tell me no bother. Light up a split for a corner. I reminisce, but it's trouble ready to a week or so. I'm not gonna forget you and you know. I know today, I know yesterday we grow. From my blind box of tears, till it reach the stage that I know. They don't know code, they don't hear auto. They just start the road, you know. Skill it, law boss. Never know bad men can be like this. Never know say people so easy if it's rich. The booty never understand.
