20251229 113717 She never danced before. She's a maniac, maniac on the job. Because she's dancing like she never danced before. Just a champion girl on a Saturday night looking for the time of her life. Dancing in this world won't faze her at all. They all say she's crazy. Dancing all night long to her favorite song. That's her! Thank you! She's dancing like she's never danced before. She's a maniac, maniac on the floor. Cause she's dancing like she never danced before.
