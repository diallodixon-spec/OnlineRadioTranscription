I'm going to put a little bit of olive oil in the pan and night is for us We were alone again, every moment stolen, yeah Feelings I've been holding in, it must be love Whenever I'm broken, you make me feel whole Whenever I'm lonely, you're there for my soul Wherever you are, girl, that's where I call my own.
