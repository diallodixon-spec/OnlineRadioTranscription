Paulwell. And Mr. Paulwell had the portfolio before, and he has held the portfolio longer than anybody else, I believe. So I believe he could ask the kind of question that he's asking, appropriate questions. So making it very clear, people have the right to ask a question, and you have the right to reject the questions or reject the suggestion, but you have to deal with it with a certain kind of demeanor bearing in mind also the fact that people are looking at you, children too. I'll tell you something, Dr. T, if it was me, I wouldn't even ask him that question. You know why, Dr. T? He doesn't fit the position with me. That's your opinion. I don't... Yes, man. I hear you. Because his reputation is not good. Hold on. Stop. Oi, oi! I warn you, stop it now. Alright. Stop. Alright.
