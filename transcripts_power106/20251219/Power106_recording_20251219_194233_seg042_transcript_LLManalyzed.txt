20251219 194233 got up, finished fifth though. Now a week has elapsed and she's back here and she has been ticked by one of the tipsters as the likely winner. When she runs and if she doesn't do anything wrong, based on her exercise reports, she should be a varsity superior horse, but didn't quite get it right and ran brilliantly as well. But I prefer go with the safer bet of number one I'm outstanding 10 then second to American diesel train over seven and a half furlongs it's now seven furlongs half a furlong shorter he was chasing for a long way I think has a very good chance the threat to both I'm outstanding and 432 could Kitty, not the ideal or best top of the race though, but should maintain a presence, particularly towards the end of the race. One I'm Outstanding picked over 430 and would go Roaring Kitty. Race 8 now
