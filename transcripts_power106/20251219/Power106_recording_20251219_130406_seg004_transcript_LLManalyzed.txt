20251219 130406 with you. Simon, on a lighter note, have you seen Richard Stevens' performance at Jimmy Cliff's funeral? Based on his rendition, I believe Richard should do an official cover of the song Trapped. I didn't. I don't really watch funeral things. And I really cannot abide funerals attended by politicians and music and the whole thing. Sorry, it's just not my scene. But I know Richard Stevens a long time, and he has one of the great voices in Jamaica, along with the great Richie Spice, by the way. I love them voices. So it doesn't surprise me that his rendition of any of the songs would have been top notch. Alright, let me go to the phone line. Voice of New York.
