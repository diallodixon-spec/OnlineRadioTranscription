20251218 175636 You're gonna let me, ain't nobody, love me better than you. First you put your arms around me. Then you put your charms around me. I'll get this, this, this sweet surrender. Oh, my nights are warm and tender. We're staring into each other's eyes. And what we see is no surprise. Got a feeling most with treasure. And our love's so deep we cannot let go. Ain't nobody, ain't nobody, love me better. Can't make me help this way. Make me feel this way, ain't nobody. Ain't nobody. Love me better. Nobody. Ain't nobody love me better.
