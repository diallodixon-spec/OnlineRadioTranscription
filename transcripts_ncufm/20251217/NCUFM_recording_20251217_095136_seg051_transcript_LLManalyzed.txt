20251217 095136 realized when it comes to singing just don't compromise see it's a matter of death and life be weak and do wrong or be strong and do right i don't want to keep going to church singing all about how much you're worth and then continue doing my dirt living as if i didn't care if you're hurt because if it's God that I'm after I just can't serve to master And before something happens I gotta turn it all around Because I know I can't just have my cake and eat it too Cause it's really deep, stay on the fence and still do you It'd be cool if we could love the Lord and still go deep I think, but see it doesn't work like that You gotta be white or black
