20251216 200503 I'm gonna win this year. I feel it. And if you're not a progress, don't come around here. I'm so focused this year. I'm gonna get my face here. I just progress, progress, progress. We end us round here. I don't want to want to die Life is so unkind and full of surprises Give it your all and you'll get nothing in return But you've got to look to the east from where the sun rises Hold your head up, you've got to get up Hold on to faith, you soon got the breath Money you gonna make this year I'm gonna win this year, I feel it If you're not see progress, don't even come near I'm so focused this year, I'm gonna get it
