20251229 100404 I've been contemplating what all of this means. It's not that I'm complaining, but circumstances be real. And I know you see these changes. Yeah, around and around we go. Doesn't it just feel amazing When I got you up in my zone You're like my favorite painting One I would never sell Just have you up in my room And keep you all to myself I'm supposed to feel when you're there close though I mean, that's can't reveal for me emotions I mean that's what we see and do the most to you I'm supposed to be where you're there closer and me just can't reveal emotions and girl we want to see you and do the most of you
