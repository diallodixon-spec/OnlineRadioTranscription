20251222 195124 WIPs, better have a whole lot of chips, cause I ain't for no giving tips. When you say my name, talk no junk, it don't look my way. See I got more truth, so back on up while I roll up a sleeve. Can't see me, Joe, get on down while I shoot for fluff. When I do my thing, got the place on fire, burn it down to flame. Roll up in my car, don't stop, won't stop. I'ma keep it rockin' till the clock don't stop. I'ma keep a hot MX-8 on fire. I'ma grab a Philly, gonna roll it in the bar. What you talk? What you say? Gotta flow, gotta move it slow. Better you, running out the door. You gonna be alone, lost soul. What you say? Yippie yi yo, yippie yi yi yi. Put me on stage, watchin' Ziggy feel back. Put me to show acts, watch it blaze like Lego. Yippie Yi Yo, Yippie Y yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
