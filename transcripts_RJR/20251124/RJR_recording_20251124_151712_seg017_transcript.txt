Jamaica, let's stay hopeful. Let's support each other and let's restore the rhythm of our island home. And remember to support Jamaica's relief efforts at supportj managed? Funeral costs not cheap. But with the family indemnity plan and critical illness right from Kuna Caribbean Insurance, COVID start at just $422.40 a month. Cheaper than a box of food. And the best part is, you don't need no medical for sign up. So link your credit union today or visit KunaCaribbean once again, but the strength of our people is unbreakable.
