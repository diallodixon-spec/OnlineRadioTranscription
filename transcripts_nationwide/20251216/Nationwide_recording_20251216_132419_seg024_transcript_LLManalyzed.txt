20251216 132419 Nobody wanna see us together But it don't matter no Cause I got you baby Nobody wanna see us togther But it don't matters no Cause we gon' fight Oh yes we gon' fight Believe we gon' fight Fight for our right to love, yeah Nobody wanna see us together But it don't matter, no Cause I know nobody wanna see us together Nobody thought we'd last forever I feel them hopin' and prayin' Things between us don't get better Men steady comin' after you Women steady comin' after me Seems like everybody wanna go for self and don't wanna respect boundaries Telling you all those lies, just to get on your side But I must admit there was a couple secrets I held inside But just know that I tried, but you always apologize And I'ma have you first, always in my heart to keep you satisfied
