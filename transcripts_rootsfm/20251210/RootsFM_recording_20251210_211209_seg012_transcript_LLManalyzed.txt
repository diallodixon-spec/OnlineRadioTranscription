here to keep you warm. Oh, darling, keep me warm. Baby, come to me. Come to me. Let me put my arms around you, press my hand to me. And I'm also glad I found you, meet you every day. Every day. Gotta have your love around me, baby. Gotta have you. Always stay. Because I can't go back to living without you. Come to me. Let me put my arms around you. Let me love you, baby. And I'm also glad I found you.
