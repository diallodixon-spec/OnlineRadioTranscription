20251226 091913 God fills us so we can pour out. He meets our needs so we can meet the needs of those around us. On Boxing Day, that promise comes alive. This day began as a tradition of giving, sharing gifts with workers, neighbors, and those in need. And today, we carry that same spirit. We remember that God's abundance is not for hoarding, but for releasing. When we give, we echo his heart. So, maybe today, your gift is not wrapped in paper. Maybe it's a kind word, a purr, a helping hand.
