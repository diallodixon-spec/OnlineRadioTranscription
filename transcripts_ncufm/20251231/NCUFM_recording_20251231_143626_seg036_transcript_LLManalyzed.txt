20251231 143626 My disciple, a lot of us listening today are professed Christians. We bear the name of Christ. We say we are followers of Christ. But God, he told us, this is how people will know that you are a follower of Christ. If you love each other, as I have loved you, that's literally what after a new commandment I give unto you. Love one another as I've loved you, so you must love one another. By have loved you so you must love one another by this verse 35 all men know that you are my disciples if conditional if you love one another my question is can somebody look at you and see how you treat individuals in the society see how you you treat your family members, the persons at your workplace, the persons in your community, those less fortunate. Can persons look on and see the love of Christ demonstrated in how you treat individuals, how you treat family members?
