But any way onto a Berry song, I'm there. I don't have a lot of things that I feel like, I don't have bucket list. It was like a bucket item. I've only wanted that. I have enough people I'm going to work with, so don't feel disrespected. But wanting a song with a particular person is not my style. I'm not really into people and names. I like music and it's always about the song. But Berry is a different kind of storyteller. Remember me telling me I'm a really into people and names and them something there. I like music and it's always about the song. But Beris is a different kind of storyteller. Remember me telling me a literature student. I love the way how him deal with the song. Beris is a man who make you, he kind of hurt left. So no, I'm not going to. You still look good enough. You're sticking around for taking the last piece and I look good and watch me out there. Oh, right. Yeah. Come in with lipstick.
