Yesterday's Roots FM was good and we aim to make tomorrow's Roots FM even better as we continuously reimagine, recreate and redesign according to your desires. And while we give thanks, let us remember those close by who may not be as fortunate as we are, as well as our brothers and sisters in Western Jamaica who are struggling through the season because of Hurricane Melissa.
