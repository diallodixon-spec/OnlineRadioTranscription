the host ended day one on 24 for one in regards to the West Indies is 205. Bilton starts from Shea Hope, 48, Captain Washington, Chase, 29. Brian Ticknor claims 4 for 32 for New Zealand, with Michael Ray supporting with 3 for 67. The holding test ended in a draw last week in Christchurch. Australia captain Pat Cummings will return for what could be a decisive third ashes test against England in Adelaide next week. The fast bowler missed the first two tests, which Australia won, and that was because he had a back problem. His addition is the only change to the Australia squad following the eighth big win in Brisbane. Australia need only draw in Adelaide to retain the Ashes, while victory will mean they will win the five-test series. England have never come from two nil down in any of the Ashes series. The third test starts on the 17th of December.
