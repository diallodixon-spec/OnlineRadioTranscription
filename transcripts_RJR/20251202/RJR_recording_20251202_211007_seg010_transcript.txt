believe it's a waste of time but to participate one with others at the community level at other levels where you might be exposed to wrongdoing which constitutes a crime to report it to Crimestop and so doing you'll be making this problem of crime a less of a problem if we join hands together.

Tonight we want to also have a look apart from the the activities of Crime Stop, to look at what the ministry is doing in terms of its policies regarding crime fighting. We have statistics coming out from the Jamaica Constabulary.
