20251216 105433 I will ask you a question, hello? You registered with the Ministry of Labour? No. So why you never do that? No, I'm not going to tell you, I never really done that when the storm blew. You see me? But you talk about yourself, so here's what I'm saying. How come you don't make the Ministry of Labour people know? Because even right now that we are here at Duns Motorola, you're a parish, that's a good little distance from where you're at Balaclava, but I want a parish the same way. You just come down the hill and make it straight down the hill, right? Yeah. So may I say, but if nobody knows where you're at, they can't help you, you know? So may I say to you now? Eh? No, yeah.
