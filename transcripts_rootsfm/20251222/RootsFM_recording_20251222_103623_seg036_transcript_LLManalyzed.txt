20251222 103623 about the Maroon government. She was very passionate about sovereignty as well. She was one that, I tell you, we shared many moments together. We shared a lot of meetings together. We'd share meetings. This was someone who I speak with every single day right through the day. I'm telling you, it's shocking, it's tragic, it's sudden. Words, I'm lost for words when I learned of her passing or transition last weekend. But she was an attorney at law as well, by profession. And she became our Chief Secretary of State as well, and had served in many capacities. She's also the Minister of Legal and Constitutional Affairs as well in our Nyankepung sovereign Maroon government.
