20251231 170805 UMA will play a critical role in regulating this new framework, enforcing standards, and leading Jamaica's transition to cleaner communities in the year ahead. And in other news, with schools set to resume for the new year in just days, uncertainties mounting over the future of families still housed at the Petersfield High School shelter in Westmoreland, following Hurricane Melissa. Earlier today, a Member of Parliament for Central Westmoreland, Duane Vaz, raised the alarm that more than 50 families, including 46 children, could be displaced as the government moves ahead with plans to reopen the institution. He called for an immediate pause on any closure of the shelter until confirmed alternative housing arrangements are in place, citing previous assurances that no family would be left behind. In response, local government and Community Development Minister Desmond McKenzie has rejected claims that the government intends to evict the displaced residents, describing reports circulating on social and traditional media.
