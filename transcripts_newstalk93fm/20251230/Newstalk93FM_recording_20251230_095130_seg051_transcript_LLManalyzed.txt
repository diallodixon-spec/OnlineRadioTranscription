20251230 095130 We define all of those blues When you say Honey Summer, time spreads, pink skies You can call me honey if you want Because I'm the one you want Winter, green kiss, all mine You give a different meaning Cause you mean it when you talk Honey, I'm home, we could play house We could bed down, pick me up Who's the baddest in the land What's the plan? You could be my forever nightstand When anyone called me, sweetheart It was passive aggressive at the bar And the chick was telling me to back off Cause a man had looked at me wrong If anyone called me, honey It was standing in the bathroom White seats, they were saying that skirt don't fit me And I cried the whole way home But you touched my face We defined all of those blues
