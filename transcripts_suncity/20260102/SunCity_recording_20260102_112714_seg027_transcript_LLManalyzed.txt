20260102 112714 you the guy who tried to hurt me with the word goodbye though it took some time to survive you i'm better on the other side i'm all good already so moved on it's scary i'm not where you left me at all so if you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody If you wanna believe that anything could stop me Don't show up, don't come out Don't start caring about me now. Walk away, you know how. Don't stop caring about me now, about me now.
