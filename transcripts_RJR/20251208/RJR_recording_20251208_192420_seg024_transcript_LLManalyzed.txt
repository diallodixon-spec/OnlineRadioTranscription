And so the scan effectively just tries to look at, based on the data that's in the system, it makes an estimation of your approximate age. Even when, you know, it doesn't sound like much, but when you think about trying to judge a 16-year-old and the margin could put you anywhere between 13 and 19, that's a very large group that would have to effectively prove their age in some other way. And in the trials that happened here, there was a report of people in high schools that were studied where 17-year-olds, 16-year-olds were being judged to be 34, 41, 13, 12. So essentially, somebody like me who has a beard and wrinkles and bags under their eyes, the technology would say you look older than 16. Likely, absolutely, right? But that also means a 16-year-old could potentially put on a fake beard, try to paint on some wrinkles. We have seen people using Halloween masks, for example.
