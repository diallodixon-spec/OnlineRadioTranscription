20251222 211914 I am still here Lord, the devil tried to kill me I am still here God held me in his arms Protect me with his hands That's why I am still here Oh Lord, I am still here Oh Lord I am still here I'm still here Even though my enemies they plot against me Say I'm still here even though the fiery darts are thrown at me. Say I'm here even though the pressures of life surrounds me. But thank God, I am still here.
