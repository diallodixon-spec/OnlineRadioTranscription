20251231 120805 We thank you, O God, for the success that you will grant us, granting us the progress to keep on, keeping on. Our communities will be reignited by the power of your Spirit and your presence. Dear God, we pray for Jamaica land we love. Land that would sometimes often be recognized as dry and barren due to the situation that we face. And we pray also for the people who have lost their crops and their livestock. Yes, for people who have gotten their land parched, O God Almighty. We pray for you, Lord, to touch and to enlist the heart of many others, O God, to join us
