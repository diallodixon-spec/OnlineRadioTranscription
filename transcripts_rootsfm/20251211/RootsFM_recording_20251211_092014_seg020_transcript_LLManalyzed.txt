But I'm not cheat me a cheat just a date by law And if I give it up, I'm not hard in the wood If you try to stop me suffer? Why do you listen to? Who do you suffer? Time to switch people up. I'm just a mingle, baby, got me outside. Playing two people at the same time. Just weighing my options. Playing two sides at the same coin. Might end up in some problems, but I don't cheat me, I cheat just a little bit.
