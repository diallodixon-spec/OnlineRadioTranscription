is not is not is not up to standard. So the granular way you're asking the question I'm sure it can be measured I'm sure but yeah so my answer to you is that it's a general problem that's been identified. You hear employers complain about it. But you see we have to also understand and be very careful when this word is being thrown around. Because people that throw this word around always have a motive. And the motive is to subject people's increasing things to you. The employees who have employees, do you believe that all employees turn up for work at the scheduled time, take their allotted lunchtime and don't go over that they'll sit and the phone rings somewhere and somebody just sits and ignores it? I think those are the things that people are talking about.
