20251216 212317 or if you have a little tank, when rain falls you catch it. There is a tank, a parish tank, by Woodlands where the prisoners and the school doctor do mark. And they send men from Kingston come cover up the hole of the tank and if rain do fall, doctor do mark, not even a tip of it going into the tank. And I've been talking about it. All it has to do, because men in Kingston, white-collar men, don't know about country. And they're sending men to come fix tanks down here. You know, leave a part, if you even cover the tank, that's a do-ma. Leave a part of it. That's when rain comes, as usual. It runs off of the barbecue and goes down into the tank. And just put a drain there. That's just when it drips in the water, the drain will take it off. But you cover up the whole thing. And so Manchester has been suffering for water, Dr. Dumas.
