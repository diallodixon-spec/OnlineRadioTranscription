20251218 144336 I know it too. All right. Thank you, Georgia. All right. So you can a little bit. We'll go back to her because she does have giveaways, but she's doing a little bit of business there as well. So I'm freeing her up to do that. All right. We are fast approaching the break. I don't want to start another conversation just yet. Just to let you know that we are in the car park at the front of the building at 32 Lindhurst Road and this is the Power 106 FM Farmers Market and I see Peter Thompson, Executive Director of the Jamaica Forage Clubs. He has rolled in the Jamaica Forage Club supporting us in a big way because they are the ones who provided the farmers for us the contacts with the farmers and of course other types of support as well so I look forward to speaking with mr. Thompson in a few minutes or not so long from now let me tell you something
