the pump attached to it. And so the pressure from the pump is a high pressure event. So when you have a shower from the pump side, you have a lot of water force coming out. But if light gone, or your pump not working, then you just have to depend on gravity feed. So the pressure for gravity feed is considerably lower. You see that Mrs. G? But not only is it lower, it is also more steady. And it can cause backups in the pipe if, let's say, the pipe has to now go through some upstairs and downstairs to get around to where it needs to go. Some of the water in the pipe might not get there because of the height it has to travel under very little pressure. Same thing that happens in our circuit system. So you can think about the pipes that are connected to the pump as our archers and when the pump is running as a
