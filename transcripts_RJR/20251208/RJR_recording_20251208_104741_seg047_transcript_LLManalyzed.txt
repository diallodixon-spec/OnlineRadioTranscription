Okay, come on. Yeah, you know we go through a period of time and our sympathies must be forever extended to all those who are going through trying times. And as we prepare ourselves to celebrate Christmas, with the true meaning supposed to be the birth of Christ, Christ coming to this earth, coming on into this world to redeem us from our sins, and whosoever believes in him shall have everlasting life. May we spirit thoughts for those who will not be so happy and with a merry feeling this time around. Sometimes not even because of the hurricane but they are those who have lost loved ones around this time. Yes.
