20251231 174119 I know you asked me many times, yeah. If I never thought of leaving you for someone else, guess you just don't see. You mean the world to me. You're never going to hurt you, my dear. Honey, honey, I hear you say that I don't need you. And I'm half the man or woman without you here by my side. And I'm proud we want to sleep. So how do we know from day to day the sun is going to? Let's take love one day at a time. Baby don't worry, it's gonna be alright. Let's take love, one day at the time.
