20251230 135638 I'm stuck right here, I can't move And the feeling shows I'm a flyer, I've travelled a long way Oh hills and highways, I've had some bad days Now I'm resting right here at your mercy Can't you see the look in my eyes? Red light! Oh please don't change a name Now don't you turn to green I'm tired, if you contented inside But not just till midnight I'd like to spend all my time with you
