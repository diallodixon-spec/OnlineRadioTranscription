reaching out to us to share that we know these people in this community that could benefit from something like this. So we're compiling our list and we're doing our very best to assist those who are in dire need at this time. Let me ask you to consider this while we go to the break. Is there a concern or does it not matter whether you are putting these homes on lands that are maybe not owned by the beneficiaries and if that's a concern or if that's already worked out. We're speaking to Andres Cope who is the manager and brand ambassador at S Hotel, the hotel in Montego Bay, seeking to provide some 60 homes free of charge to homeless people in the western end of Jamaica at a cost of some $21 million.
