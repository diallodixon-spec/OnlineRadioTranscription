20251217 140808 My best friend, one who has finished school, one is in UT now. And my husband. Best university. Yes, they are my strong support. My son is there now and he's enjoying it. Yes. They are my strong support because at times when I feel down, they pray for me. They encourage me and they would go with me on some of the journey. Yes. You know, so that I can be uplifted. Excellent. So, it's so important to have your family who will be there for you as well. And Nurse Collins, do you get the feeling often enough that your country and your profession love you as much as you love your profession and your country? My country and my profession love me. There are more to be done. They can love you some more. Excellent. And they can value our worth some more. But I know the love is there. Love is always there. Thank you very much. All the best to you. Fiona Collins, Deputy Director of Nursing Services at Percy Junior Hospital. She is the 2025 Lascaux Nurse of the Year.
