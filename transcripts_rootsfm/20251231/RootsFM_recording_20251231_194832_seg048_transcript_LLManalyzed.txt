Begging promoters, singing so free. You release a song, real hype up on me. Bum chidi bibi bibi bibi. Nonsense. You get killed and hijacked and the whole world see. You come back safe and so sympathy. Say you want to do a collaboration with me. Ha, ha, ha. Boy, I only cash you two kicks You up and you feelin' heavy like bricks The other morning I kill you with lyrics And you hide in your face like a snitch What is that? You start high behind the man back Your confidence drop, you went down and flopped You run to the old recorder next track Well now I'm gonna kill you full stop, boy
