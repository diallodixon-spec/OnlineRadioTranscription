20251226 140807 I guess, now it's time For me to give up I think it's time Got a picture of you beside me Got your lipstick marks along my cup of cups Got a fist off your emotion. Gotta hand in the shine of dreams. Gotta leave it. Gotta leave it on the island now. And whenever I said, whenever I did, I didn't mean it. I just want you back for good. See, I want you back for girl. And whenever I'm home, just send me the song, I'll sing it. You'll be right up on the search. I want you back, want you back.
