2025-12-11 19:40:48 I want to put forward. You see, it's that quite a few people in Jamaica are using this hurricane Melissa release thing to try and score political points. Do you know what a couple of senior teachers said to me today? If the people down in Westmoreland never complain, how the Prime Minister only go to a black river and so on, no help wouldn't go to Westmoreland. I said look here, nothing of that sort. I am on the ground. I accompany vehicles down there, carry release packages and so on. I go to Westmomoreland, I go to St. Elizabeth, I go to Trelawny, I go all over the place and nothing of that sort. The Prime Minister at the time, the helicopter couldn't find place to land down there.
