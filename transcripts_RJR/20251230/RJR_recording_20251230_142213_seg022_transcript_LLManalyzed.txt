20251230 142213 Now I'm floating like a butterfly Singing like a bee, I heard the skies I went from zero to my own hero You held me down, but I got up Already brushing off the dust You hear my voice, you hear that sound Like thunder gonna shake the ground You held me down but I got up Get ready cause I've had enough I see it all, I see it now I got the eye of the tiger, the fighter Dancing through the fire Cause I am a champion And you're gonna hear me roar Louder, louder than a lion Cause am a champion. And you're going to hear me roar. You're gonna hear me roar.
