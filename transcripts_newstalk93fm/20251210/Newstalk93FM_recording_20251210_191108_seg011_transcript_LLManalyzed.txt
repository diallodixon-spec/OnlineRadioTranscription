When I told you to fall back So can you come pick up your clothes? I had them folded Leave me at the door While it's still open I know it's getting cold out But it's not closing So come pick up your clothes I had them folded I'll let you If this is good enough for ya Already folding it for ya Already folding up for ya I'll let you That's the crazy part I don't need no more empty place
