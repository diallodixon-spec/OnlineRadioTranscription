============================================================

I'm very pleased with the team, very pleased with the performance. Out of the four trophies we'll collect two, which is fair enough for us. We didn't get a chance to collect all four, but we have to give thanks anyway. We try our very best, we give it our best. Meanwhile, coach of Division 2 Scotiabank Damian Gordon says discipline led to his team's success this season and he knows it will be a tougher competition in Division 1 next season. I mean we're still humble as a unit, it's a huge achievement for us and from day one we had a plan in terms of how well we were going to execute that plan and a very disciplined team and we were like a family and I think that was one of our strengths.
