20260102 123320 will be here again at 5.25 later this evening until then stay tuned stay glued and stay locked in to nationwide 90 FM. Stop this foolish about this JLP and PNP business. We are a Jamaican. It's not a matter of a JLP or a PNP. I think it's more like where it is that you think you're comfortable, what support you can offer to make the country better. Most entertainers, they're not amenable to management. So the only thing that can ultimately structure them is the court and the prison.
