20251215 135341 The first thing that came to my head was the occupational safety and health legislation or lack thereof. Because a hurricane, especially a category five hurricane like this, can be a disabling event. It can be an event that puts you in a position where provisions that would have protected your rights, like those under the Occupational Safety and Health Bill that we have not yet put into force, would have been useful to have. I can't help but hope as well, as we're talking about, once for next year. We usually hear it brought up in the legislative agenda. I sincerely hope that it is something that is on the forefront of our legislators' minds going into next year, considering that we, based on all trends, are up for more heavy natural events.
