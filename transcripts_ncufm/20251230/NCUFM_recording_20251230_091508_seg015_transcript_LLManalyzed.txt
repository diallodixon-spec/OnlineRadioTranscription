20251230 091508 This Christmas, choose life. As we recover from Hurricane Melissa's devastation, we're reminded that life is fragile. Pedestrians, stay alert. Drivers, slow down. Rest if you're tired, and never drink and drive. One careless decision can change a family forever. Let's have a safe and prayerful Christmas and a Christ-free 2026. NCUFM as we read the Holy Bible one chapter each day, Sunday to Sabbath, 5.30 a.m. with a repeat at 9.30 p.m. So join me daily for this wonderful experience on NCUFM.
