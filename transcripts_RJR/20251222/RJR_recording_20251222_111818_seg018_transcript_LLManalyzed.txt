20251222 111818 So it's my distinct pleasure to have Mrs. Goff on. Welcome, Madam President. How are you? Thank you, Clive. Good morning. Good morning to your listeners. You know, I have always been an admirer of the Pensions Association because you have spot on in some of the recommendations you've been making about pensions. Yes? I, for one, believe it ought to be a situation situation of an opt out, eh? Where persons automatically are enrolled in a pension. Things that's so very important. Yes, the work that we've been doing in auto enrollment. So right now, our pension regime in Jamaica is one where you have to join a pension plan. If your employer doesn't have one, you have to go and essentially sign up for one. So the Alton Roman proposal is one where we pick that choice architecture and put the responsibility on the employer where no pension plan exists in the workplace to put you in any one of the 13 retirement schemes that we have in Jamaica and then you can opt in if you wish.
