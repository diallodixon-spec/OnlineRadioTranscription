20260102 190909 Oh I'm waiting, baby. I think you're in love, and I know that you can love me back. Mother nature must have sent you here for me. I want to be the first thing that you see. I'll be glad just to know that you feel like I feel. Just hold me, baby, like I wanted to from the day that I met you. Hold me, baby time, fulfilled by the whole of my life Oh me baby, I got you from the day I met you Oh me baby
