============================================================

So you know, my love, give me your hand and then we'll take you somewhere. It's high love. If you want it naturally, I'll give it to you properly. I walk to the valley of death. They can't touch my destiny. They can't come sit next to me. The more them hate me, I go higher, higher, higher. Over me, over. Let time move over. Oh, I I'm a noisier from the air to the snow, but I know it ain't over me, over me, over, let the winds blow over me. Oh, I am a noisier, from the air, to the snow but I know it isn't over me, let them know it ain't.
