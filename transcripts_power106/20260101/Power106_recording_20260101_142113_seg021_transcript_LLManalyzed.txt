20260101 142113 Oh, my love, come on, come on, let's go. You're loose, you're loose, yeah, like a blue. You're like a blue. Like a blue. You've got to turn it around. And put your feet on the ground And take a hold of hope Lose, footloose, kicked off your Sunday shoes. Please, Louise, pull me up on my knees. Jack, get back, come on, before we crack. Lose, you're blue, everybody come footloose.
