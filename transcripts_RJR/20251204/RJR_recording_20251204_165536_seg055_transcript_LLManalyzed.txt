and making it a fun day. And thank you, listeners, for always making it the Two Life Crew. You know, we can't do this without you. We want to thank the folks who tuned in on TV right across the island and overseas on One Spot Media. Thank you so much. Our fact of the day says some everyday Jamaican dishes and cooking methods trace back to Chinese roots. The use of soy sauce, ginger, scallion, and stir-fry methods in Jamaica reflect Chinese culinary influence. Want to thank our producer, Daniel Lee, for pulling everything together. Our TV team is a big team, you know. Make sure to set it up, Maui. We want to thank you for, you know, all that you do for making this success today. Every Thursday! Every Thursday, one hour. 3.30 to 4.30, you know, it's a big show. It's a big show! But of course, but hello, we are on one to five. It's a Big Show! We're still there one to five!
