**Interview with Janine Fletcher-Taylor and Corinne Smith**

In a recent interview on Radio Jamaica's "Talk with Substance" program, host Emily Shields sat down with Janine Fletcher-Taylor, Manager of the Marketing Services Unit at the Jamaica Business Development Corporation (JBDC), and Corinne Smith, founder of Perfecting Savannah's Craft. The discussion centered around the importance of supporting local businesses and promoting Jamaican-made products, particularly during the holiday season.

Fletcher-Taylor emphasized the need for conscious consumption, encouraging listeners to look for the "Made in Jamaica" mark when shopping. She highlighted the diversity of products available through the JBDC's retail arm, Things Jamaican, which supports over 2,000 clients and features 500 brands in its retail chains. Fletcher-Taylor noted that by choosing Jamaican-made products, consumers can help circulate funds within the economy and support the recovery of businesses affected by Hurricane Melissa.

Corinne Smith, who creates handmade earrings, necklaces, and sculptures under the brand Perfecting Savannah's Craft, shared her experiences as a small business owner. She revealed that her business had been impacted by the hurricane, with two major customers losing their stock and struggling to recover. Despite this challenge, Smith remains optimistic and continues to create unique, lightweight, and affordable products using polymer clay.

Fletcher-Taylor also discussed the JBDC's efforts to support small businesses, particularly in the aftermath of the hurricane. She emphasized the importance of providing marketing support and access to markets for these businesses, which offer a wide range of products that cater to various needs and trends. The conversation concluded with a call to action, encouraging listeners to support local businesses and choose Jamaican-made products, thereby contributing to the country's economic recovery and growth.

As Fletcher-Taylor aptly put it, "We want to make sure that we are supporting these clients with the type of marketing support that is necessary for persons to know about them." By promoting and purchasing Jamaican-made products, consumers can play a vital role in helping small businesses like Perfecting Savannah's Craft thrive and contributing to the country's overall development.
