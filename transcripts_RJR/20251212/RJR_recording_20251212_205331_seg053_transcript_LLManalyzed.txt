20251212 205331 What if I want you and my side man to be friends? And when you come home from work, the tree are we there on the edge? What if I need you and my sideman to be friends? Polygamy's a casual thing. But no worry, because you are the main king. You're bright. Keep your side piece a pilly and a cover. You can't take bun, but you want to love her. One leap, leap, like say you is a plumber. Me know you have a pencil, make sure you have a rubber. You have sheet, now you're one with the meat. A rock of darts that you want to knee. Take her five times a week if she make you complete. But that's your secret to keep. Hey, what if I want you and my side man to be friends? Nothing to feel like a woman's touch. I'm the best man right here.
