you did a spoke for me Tell me how you feel now, Chargé How you feel both hardy Bad things I say, I don't forget I'm there, you're there, put the pieces to the puzzle And I look for myself in the mirror, I'm not coming from You live what I'm in, man Number the trouble trouble, the trouble when I trouble your fam Never give up me, search hit me fam Still I carry the burden, hit me strong Now me got the world in me and everybody know of the sounds No fuse to react me, no fear me Fear me even feel like sin
