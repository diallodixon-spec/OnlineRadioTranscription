you always tell me that you need me and i'm weak because i believe you and i'm mad because i love you So I stop and think that maybe You could learn to appreciate me Then it all remains the same That you ain't never gonna change Never gonna change My days are cold baby And though my heart can't take no more I'll keep on talking back to you See my days are cold without shit out of you I'm hurting while I'm here I know my heart
