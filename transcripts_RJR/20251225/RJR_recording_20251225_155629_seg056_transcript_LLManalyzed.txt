20251225 155629 I'm in love with this Christmas. I'm in love, in love. In love, in love, with this Christmas. Nowadays, some of us kids aren't quite sure what Christmas really is. Mummy and Daddy always told me that Christmas was a happy time, especially for kids. But now it seems that grown-ups have turned Christmas into one big shopping spree. Where the best and most precious gift of all is within of hate and misery behind us.
