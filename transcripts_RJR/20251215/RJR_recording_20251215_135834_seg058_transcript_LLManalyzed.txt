20251215 135834 Police Station, also to retired Inspector Keble Thomas of Bushy Park Mape and Clarendon, wishing them a wonderful day. Only the best born in December, away I say. Coming from Mrs. Janet Bowes in Bushy Park, Clarendon. And it's, it is whose birthday? Is it, is it Janet's birthday? It's her 59th birthday today, you know, Kenneth. Who, Janet?! Mrs. Bose. No, I thought she celebrated her birthday last week. Really? Janet Mouser says it's her day today. Janet's celebrating for the entire month. Well, that would be good. As she should, you know. Right? This one says birthday greetings to my dear mother, Mrs. Irene Riley from Golden Grove, St. Anne. Greetings coming from your nine children, Madge, Gracie, Junie, Lovey, Maxine, Aaron, Albert, Len, and Maxine. Also other relatives and friends, Mama 92 and counting, please enjoy your golden years to the max. They love you loads, the entire family.
