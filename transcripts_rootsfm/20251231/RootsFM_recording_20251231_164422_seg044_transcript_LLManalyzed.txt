20251231 164422 This love is the truth, yeah And we've got the fruits to prove it Still I keep a wide eye for parasites Who try to defy Now, people gon' try things Some find pleasure in squiling a cookie Still I let them know that in our life there is no weaklings Now there's more than a million rivers to cross But we don't make it through And more than a gazillion people gonna talk So so so so so so Love that dreams are made of And in my visions all I see is her We got something strong And so we're holding on We got it going on
