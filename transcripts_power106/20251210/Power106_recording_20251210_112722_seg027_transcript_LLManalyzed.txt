problem with a Ministry of Health saying we're going to ban sodas from the school canteen in order to reduce the reliance on sugar and the incidence of diabetes etc. Which is a different thing because I don't have a problem with you saying. Well I might say one is mental and one is physical. Indeed, and I don't have problem with you banning cigarettes on somebody under the age of 18 or whatever. Which we have in this country, but of course, even when I was about six, my mother would send me down to the shop to buy her a number seven. So... Oh, it's a difficult one. Yeah, it's... I have to wrestle with that one one but I'd love to hear what you all think about that band. It's a view that social media kind of poised in the UK, Australia is near China so maybe we'll never follow Shijinpik.
