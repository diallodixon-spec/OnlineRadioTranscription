projects to help everybody. It's a form of service to showing compassion and kindness. The theme this year is experiencing is light. Experiencing? Is light. Okay. Describe the light as bright. Good. Okay. Beautiful. Thank you so much for that. I'm sure that the initiative this time around Elder Manning means a lot to you personally, especially when you think about what persons, the citizens of St. James, for example, have been through recently. Yes, it does. And it sure does. And that's a great statement and a great question. So based on the devastation that we have seen, everybody had faced a lot during this period of time. It's a traumatic time. I think it's now the time for us to unite as one and help each other. It doesn't necessarily take a lot of funds. It is really reaching out to each other, being compassionate.
