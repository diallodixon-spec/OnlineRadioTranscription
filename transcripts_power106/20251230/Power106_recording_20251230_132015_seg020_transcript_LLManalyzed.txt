20251230 132015 a lot of ignorant people yes and what you are saying now that it is pointing us now that is the time now for the national school nutritional policy to be established that i that i am advocating for from 2007 bless up yourself would be there's no other powerful macroeconomic policy framework that i can see that they can come up with in place now yes because if the kids are hungry, it affects their brains, it affects their brain development, affects their behaviour, it affects how they feel. Oh, you're not hearing me? I'm agreeing with you that the studies have shown that if the heart pumps blood with nutrition around the body and to the brain especially and if you have a situation where children are constantly hungry, it actually affects their brain development and their behaviour.
