20251231 155531 Morning will come and the day will see If you're gonna get some She's a girl you know she act too tough, tough, tough But still I turn off the light, turn off the light She's a girl, you know she act so rough, rough, rough But still I turned off the light, turned off the light I said run to me, run to me run to me Down, down, down, down till you see all my dreams And that's everything and it's magical Well, I just wanna let you see all my dreams? I'm searching for things that I just cannot see Well, don't you, don't you Don't you come and be with me And I pretend to be cool with me Wanna believe I can do it on my own Without my heart on my sleeve I'm running, I'm running Catch up with me like Where's the love that I'm looking to find? It's all in me, can't you see? Why can't you, why can't you see it's all in me?
