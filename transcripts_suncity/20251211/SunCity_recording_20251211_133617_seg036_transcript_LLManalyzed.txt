Lisa, it is so good to see you. But sorry you catch me like this, girl. My uncle said when my family go for clarity, you don't want to hear the price of the people they put on or something. But the matter is worse, me hear say half of the thing they're missing. And me know say a customs. Girl, how you know say a customs? Lisa, stop going like you're not having a sense, man. You know say everybody talk about it in the media. You know, if you stop listening to hearsay, you ever experience that? Customs don't go into your package, suitcase, barrel or cargo unless you ship the item or the agent stand up right there when they inspect it. Listen. Customs' job is to protect the borders, collect revenue and facilitate trade. They don't collect or store shipment, they inspect it and somebody else represents it for inspection. So how do customers ever get so much custom then? Tracy, and the customs are alone involved in the clearance process, even though it's them we tend to talk about.
