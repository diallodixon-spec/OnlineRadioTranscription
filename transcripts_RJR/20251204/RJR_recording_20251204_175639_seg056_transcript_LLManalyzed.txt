So in relation now to people listening who may want to help, what would be your primary needs? Or what is the best way for people to help? Let me put the best way. If you know of a person with a disability in your community that has been impacted and you have the resources to connect them to the JCPD, that becomes one of four requests that we will make. If you have resources, if you have assistive aids, wheelchairs, and you are willing to donate those to supplying persons who have been impacted, that's another need that we may have. So those are the two priority areas I would want to invite persons to come on board to support. One is identifying those who have a disability, where they are, and how we can get to them.
