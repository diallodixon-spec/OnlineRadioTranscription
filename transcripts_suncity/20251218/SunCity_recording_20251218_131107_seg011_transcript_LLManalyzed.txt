20251218 131107 I don't even know people that came before me I never believe. You see me an angel. I promise. You're gonna love me for life. And it's gonna be perfect. Only because it's the only way I'm gonna cross over. This is the world. This is what it is. I could be dreaming of just planes raising up. This is what love is. Cause I never felt like it, baby. It sits in love. Love is what it needs. Love is all that I need.
