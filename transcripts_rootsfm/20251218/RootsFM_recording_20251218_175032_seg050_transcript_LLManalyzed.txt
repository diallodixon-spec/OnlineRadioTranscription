20251218 175032 I'm sitting in the movie show, reading nasty thoughts. I better be a gentleman, or you'll tear me off. That's right, let me tell you. Nasty, nasty boys, I don't mean a thing. Oh, you nasty boys, nasty, nasty boys. I don't ever change. Oh, you, nasty boys. Don't, no no nasty cup I don't like nasty food The only nasty thing I like is a nasty groove Will this one do?
