2025-12-12 16:01:22 But it feels one sided now It feels one sided now You don't have to return about it Cause it's crystal glad now, now Guess it's bye to the good times I'll be gone by the sunrise I'll be better on my own I'll better on my own, now, now Nobody should call my phone Nobody should call my home,, nah, this is my last heartbreak song This is my last heartbreaking song Nah, nah, I'll be good on my own I'll be good all on my own Nah, nah, why are you so quick to leave When we both can make it work When I'm gone, I'll make you nervous If you hurt me, I deserve it I've been acting foolishly Forgetting what you were You start loving me, I know this But even chaos serves a purpose It feels good to love somebody
