20251231 104722 Well done, Mr. Politician, man. You've done a wonderful job, I see you're done, with country demolition, man. Sibley Ben, well done, well done, Mr. politician, man. You done such a such a great job selling out the country with the business plus. Which is to keep poverty and unemployment on the rise. Corruption and not to mention the lies. Election and when the tension arise. So you buy with Kentucky not to mention the price. Anything to secure your vote and then you rob the people, we secure your vote. We go to Thailand where the Chinese own. No, Jamaica is a Chinese loan. I tell you, well done. Well done. Well done, Mr. Politician, man. How are you treating us? You turn a wonderful job until you're done with country.
