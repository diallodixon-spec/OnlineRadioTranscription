============================================================

I pray you restore your people's souls Naughty got to be firm and strong This time I'm fitter than grease Selfishness at its highest jaw But my soul will never be slow. Child, I'm trying to dance, and we were born fighting tension and fear. But by default, we've lost love for self and don't know how to proceed.
