20251218 184222 Behold the city where Jesus is king. Behold the city, where there'll be no more sin. I can't wait to see Jesus' face. I just can't wait to feel his warm embrace. Don't have to beg my best for heaven Don't have to walk ten thousand miles Don't have to pay my way to see Jesus Cause he's right here by my side. All my space is reserved for me. The cost of my crown is free.
