20251229 183326 I want to give you some loving, girl. Can I drive like this when it's raining? None of us will be complaining. Intensity will be maintaining. I want to be next to you. Are you coming over tonight? I'm feeling lonely. Are you lonely, baby? I want to hold you in my arms. Well, I just want to treat you right. Yeah, baby. Yes, I'm coming over tonight. I need you, baby. Think of all the nights that I've had. There's no crazy things. It's all about the ladies. Flexing it down the sidewalk, I see the ladies to the east, the west, the north. Most beautiful I've ever seen. Thinking of the right approach to me.
