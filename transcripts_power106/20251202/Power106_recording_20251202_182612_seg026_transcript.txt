quality, I suspect. What are your thoughts? Yeah, I mean, we've watched them play. I mean, while we were in camp, we were able to watch them the first game on Friday. And then we watched them obviously last night at Guyana, where they were both dominant in their display. And they picked up, you know, six points on the road, which has always been impressive for them. And now we have to go into Nicaragua which is always a challenging environment to say the least so that's where our preparation is now and we turn our focus to you know March 2nd and making sure we get in first and foremost safely and get in in the adequate time to give us the best preparation possible to win that match as well. Is there an opportunity between now and the 2nd of March for the team to assemble? No, there isn't. And so, you know, we'll have to do some things a little bit offline. But we've done that. We've continued to communicate with the players.
