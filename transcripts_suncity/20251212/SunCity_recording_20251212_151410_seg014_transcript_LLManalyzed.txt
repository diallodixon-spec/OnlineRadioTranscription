I got the sunshine, and let me read a chapter daily Man, the inner city hungry and no heat And food they don't have country does a drop off of the treat them You see self poverty no real then It's what the rings did reveal then Who knows, who knows, who knows, who knows? I just go record trading blows, sending love to my friends and foes. And I suppose I'm pleased to be chilling in the West Indies.
