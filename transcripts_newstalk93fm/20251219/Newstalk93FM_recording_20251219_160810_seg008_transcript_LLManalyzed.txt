20251219 160810 I don't care, I'm telling you I don't care I don't care about the world, I don't care Don't pray for me If I don't come home in the morning Just know that I say it's not in my place But this mass of a hole in me, I can't leave Until every single bottle down If anyone looking for me then You can find me where Bamba's changing, higher beating People fighting, so can't please If they want to know, tell them You can find me out on the road, I'm ready to walk. Just the one time to feel. Cannibal won't let me go. To send a search party to find me. I out on the road and line me. Tell them that it's who that have me. They can't even see me when I say. To send a such party to find me, I lost on the road.
