20251224 133428 I want to dance to a love song. Zoom. Cut the lights down low. Zoom. Ooh, it's almost time to go. I want to dance. To a love song. Love song, love song. What a lovely way. Ooh, what a lovely way to end the night When I hold, when I hold my baby ever so tight Please, Mr. DJ, slow the music down. I want to dance, I want to dance to a love song.
