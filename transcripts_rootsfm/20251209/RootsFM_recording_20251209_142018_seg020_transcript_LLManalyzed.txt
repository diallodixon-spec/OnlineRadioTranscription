If you could know how much I love you, girl, you'll never leave. You'll never go. Remember the good times we shared together, baby. I just want you to stay forever, forever, you and I. You are the reasons why I can't sleep at night, oh,. You are the seasons that changes with every time that I love you. You are the reasons, why I can sleep at night. Oh baby, you are the seasons that change with every time.
