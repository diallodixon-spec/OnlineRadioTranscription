Where who am I? Put your lips on me I really really like When I put it all together for you I'm gonna take my time My nails had new perfume Hated when you had to leave But I don't say a thing Cause I will absolutely get the ring No worries, no worries Oh baby baby baby, yeah Gonna use my expertise I'ma keep it nice, Ima keep it neat Ima keep it sugar, ima keep it sweet Ima keep it nice, nice, neat, neat Sugar, sugar, sweet, sweet
