20251216 171309 an 18-month sentence. The ruling was delivered by Justice Emma Peters in Grand Cayman late last month. According to police reports, the Cayman Islands Coast Guard intercepted the vessel on March 25, about 32 nautical miles south of Grand Cayman. Cunningham was operating the boat, while Samwells was the sole passenger. During a search, officers discovered nine packages of marijuana, along with a GPS device and a satellite phone. Both men initially pleaded not guilty, but later changed their pleas ahead of their scheduled trial. Cunningham admitted that he agreed to transport the drugs after being promised payment, which he said he never received. Samuels told the police he was pressured into participating after being threatened. In sentencing, Justice Peters acknowledged that neither man played a leading role in the operation, but stressed that maritime drug trafficking remains a critical part of the illegal supply chain.
