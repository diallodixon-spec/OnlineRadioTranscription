20251215 124128 Effort comes from Martin in Angels. I agree. Councillor Barnswell was travelling with his wife and spotted something unusual, this man with a child, and he took the time to stop and accosted the man. What's going on here? Where's the child come from? Where are you going with the child at this particular place? And of course, as it turns out, the child was abducted. Yes, but for his thoughtful and timely intervention. Really happy that and of course want to take the time to thank Councillor Barnswell, right? For that, Councillor Cian Barnswell. Big up, sir. I've been clarifying that. This one says, okay. Oh, from Marsha, it says that Mary sent out condolences on the passing of mr anthony smith or ceo i tell you it's a difficult time you know so it says hello good afternoon mr mornings please ask mr bobby wanted you to remember the time at district in western st
