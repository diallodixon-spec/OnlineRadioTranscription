20251215 185334 I want the love that is stronger than a lion. I want the country to hold my hand. I want a love that is stronger that a lion. Give me the loving that's stronger than a lion, the 50-50 loving ain't no good for the pliers. A hundred percent I love it couldn't be my heart desire you're missing. You're dissing. So, you better pump it up, pump it up. Pump it up with some sunshine love. She better pump it up. With some sunshine love. I want to love this moment and the summer sunshine. Oh baby, your love is too cold for me. I want the love to set me free.
