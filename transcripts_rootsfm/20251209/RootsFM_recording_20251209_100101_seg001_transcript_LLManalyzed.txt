============================================================

I'll still see the first. I give thanks and praise. For life, you know. I give thank and praise to every living thing. On the face of the earth, the heavens, the sea. Well, I give thanks and praise for all human beings, you know, that you have created in your image and likeness. Omnipotent, omnipresent. Give thanks to plants and animals, which are a beautiful part of your creation. Give thanks to the elements of life.
