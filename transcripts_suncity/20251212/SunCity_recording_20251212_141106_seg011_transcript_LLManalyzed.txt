20251212 141106 me than who else. No longer walking in the shadows. I've learned to love me more than anyone else. And I will never be the same again. Making boundaries. I'm making boundaries. Walls so thick that you won't climb. Lines so long that you can't find my heart. Will never be something for anyone to trample on again. Gotta protect me to the end. Live my life with no regrets. Though the past I don't forget. All the lessons I had to learn. Swe sweets of flames and the fire burns brought out the greatness in me i won't be afraid to be who i am no making boundaries hey making boundaries
