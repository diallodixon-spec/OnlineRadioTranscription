20251212 094623 show behind 2022. I think I'm missing some of them. But for five years, St. Catherine schools held down the trophy. And then on the sixth year it went. So we had like Son Jack, JJ Badness from Margotty High, who is also a pilot. And he's still doing music. So that's one of our big winners for 2021, 2022, DJ Leon, 2022, 2023, 2024 was Arden High and then 2025 was Kelly's High. 2023 was Kelly's High again. So they actually won twice. So that's also a big feat as well. So I want to just pick up all those schools. Unfortunately, we won't be going to the West this year. I know that the schools have reached out to me way before, but we're working to see how best we can eliminate that learning loss and work alongside students and hopefully next year we'll come back bigger in the Western parishes and Eastern parishes as well. So tell us, what are your plans for the future?
