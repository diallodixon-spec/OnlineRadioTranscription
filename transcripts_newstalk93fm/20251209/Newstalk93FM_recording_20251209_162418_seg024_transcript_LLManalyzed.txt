It's so easy to fall in love with the way I do my hair, the way I make you laugh, the way we like to share a walk in Central Park. I could be fresh air, might be the girl of your dreams. There's no need to hide if you're into me Cause I'm into you quite intimately And maybe one night could turn into three Well, I'm down to see cause I make it so Easy to fall in love So come give me a call And we'll fall into us It's so easy
