20251229 152927 best for 2026. I wish you every blessing. 2025 has been a trying year for many of us, especially those in the southwest with the passage of the hurricane. But by God's grace, let us continue pushing forward. If you don't take anything away from this broadcast, take at least one thing I should say. Please be vigilant. I could talk about adverse possession for the entire year. It could be the only subject we talk about every Monday from 2.30 to 3.30 and there would still not be enough to discuss. But whatever side of the debate that you are on, if you are a landowner, be vigilant. Please, I beg you, paying your taxes isn't enough. I beg you, please be vigilant. Thanks again, everyone. It has been our pleasure providing this service to you for 2025.
