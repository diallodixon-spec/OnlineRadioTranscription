20260101 114721 I love it, I love it You love it, you love it Every time, every time We touchin', we touchin' I want it, I want it You want it, you want it I'll see you, see you In the mornin', in the mornin' Wanna put my fingers through your hair Wrap me up in your legs Love you till your eyes roll back I'm tryin' to put you to bed Weed. I'm your soldier, touching you like it's our first time I'ma put you to bed, bed, bed Watch the sunlight peek over the horizon
