If my girl ever gave me a reason to leave her, baby, what's wrong with you? If my man ever gave me reason to leave him, baby, what is wrong with you? What's wrong with you, what's wrong, baby? Baby, baby, baby, don't move on to you. If my girl ever give me a reason for leaving her, baby, I'm done with you. Is there nobody there to lead her? Give me a little time, I need a feature. Under the moonlight, I'm sent y'all. I love you, I love you so much time, you're not for jealous I do what the best wife, me have the venom I rub it, don't rub it, I like it Your body good, you give me, I like it Thank you for time, thank you for time
