20251215 130606 brought before the courts, the under utilization of body cameras. And I do take note that the cabinet has just approved an additional 1000 body cameras. That's a very good update, but it would be good to get the update from the police commissioner on the status of the procurement of the 1000 that was being procured before. Last I heard from the police commissioner several weeks ago was that we do expect those body cams to be in the island in another four weeks. That was several weeks ago and that four weeks deadline would have expired. So it's something that we just need to follow up on. We support the police, all of us as Jamaicans, law-abiding citizens, but we must also be vigilant about that escalating number of citizens being killed at the hands of the state and ensuring that there's transparency in those figures. All right, so over to you, Jane.
