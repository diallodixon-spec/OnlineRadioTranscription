There aren't very many of those. And that's your quote of the day. Just to repeat that for you, but I think it bears repeating from Danica Patrick. Take those chances and you can achieve greatness. If you play too safe, you'll never know what's possible. I truly believe that what doesn't kill you makes you stronger. And even when you fail, learning and moving forward can be the greatest victory of all. But all our children need to be reminded.
