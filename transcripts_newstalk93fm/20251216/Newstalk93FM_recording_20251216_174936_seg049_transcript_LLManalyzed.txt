20251216 174936 Please don't speak my name. Just say goodbye. It's too late to lie. You we're face to face. We both have flaws, so we both need grace. And I would never want a world without your warm embrace. So no matter what we're going through, I keep a sacred place in my heart. There's a space in my heart for you. You never have to doubt if my love is true. I keep a secret place in my heart. There's space in my heart. For you. Girl, I got to testify. With you, I want to take my time.
