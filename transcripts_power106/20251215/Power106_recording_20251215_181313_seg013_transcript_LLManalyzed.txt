So I knew it was going to be a very difficult road for us but I was hoping that would have gotten our hat together enough to be able to surpass these challenges. But apparently we didn't. I don't think the coach's style of coaching suited the players that we have. And what bothers me is that we took too long to realize it, or he had to resign first to realize it. You know, So it bothers me a lot in terms of where the program is going, how we are administering the program, the development around the island, stuff like that. It bothers me.
