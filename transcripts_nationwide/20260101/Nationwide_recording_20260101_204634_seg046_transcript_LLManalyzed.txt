20260101 204634 This feeling so deep inside of me Such a tender fantasy You're the one I'm waiting for You are my sunlight and my rain And time could never change what we shared forevermore I never knew love like this before Now I'm lonely nevermore Since you came into my life Cause I've never needed a life like this before Open my eyes Cause I never needed a love like this before
