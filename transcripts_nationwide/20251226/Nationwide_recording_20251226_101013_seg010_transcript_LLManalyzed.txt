20251226 101013 I don't want me with your love I don't be with your love baby I don't want be with your love Don't strike me with your love baby And I'll do all the things that you want me to do Don't touch me with your love, baby Don't stop me with your love They say they're free, you know you go too far Around the world they follow Cause I don't know what shows you what you're made to make Every time I reach out to you, I'm starved
