20251230 150201 like what, 40 days? The situation right now, we don't know exactly where things are going. We have so much back and forth with tariffs and all this type is going on. The job situation here is not, doesn't look that great. I can tell you, it's the first time you feel like, you know, if my job is going to be safe in the next five years. And if you ask a lot of people, if they're honest, they're probably going to answer no, I'm not sure. So people over here are facing challenges also. So we want to help as much as possible. And the food item here is very expensive too, by the way. So I tell people a lot of the food items here in Jamaica is probably cheaper in Jamaica because a lot of it is coming from Guyana, India, South America.
