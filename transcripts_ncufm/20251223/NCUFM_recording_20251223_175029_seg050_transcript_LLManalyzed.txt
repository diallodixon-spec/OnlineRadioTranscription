It's the Santa Claus, if you've ever seen that. You haven't seen the Santa Claus? No. Wow. So I'm the only one that has seen Spirited? Yeah. Spirited. Okay. I guess I have some homework to do as well. That's a nice holiday favorite. Drive Time family, we're having a wonderful time here in studio. I'm gonna take take a break and be back with you with some more music, something special from Uncle Donny. And then we'll have our sports report at 6. A learning moment
