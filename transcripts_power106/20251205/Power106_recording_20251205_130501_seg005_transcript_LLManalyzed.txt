If I was a woman and Kamala was running, even if she wasn't as bright as her opponent or whatever, I'd vote for her to break the glass ceiling. If I was a woman, I would have to vote for a woman. I do not understand the premise, particularly in the case of Donald Trump, of choosing Donald Trump over Kamala for black people. I don't get it. For a man who basically said he can walk around and group your wife, your daughter, anybody because she's cute and because she's a celebrity, and you still vote for him? If a man tell me that, I'll turn to them face. Sorry to say that, but you know.
