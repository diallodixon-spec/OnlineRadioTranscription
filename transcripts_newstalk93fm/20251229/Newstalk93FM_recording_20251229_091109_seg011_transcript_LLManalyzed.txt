20251229 091109 I'll tell you that we're all in love Jump up and show me love, wait up, and show me love Together, till we're all in Love Jump up and show love, wait up and show love Sucker make we stronger together No place that I'd rather be Stronger together Right now is our energy Stronger together Sucker is our partner I'm always on the grind. My body's not keep up. Take your troubles and drive them all away. Get ready to run across the stage. Get ready, get ready. Give me energy, real energy. I said it's OK, but jump it, jump it.
