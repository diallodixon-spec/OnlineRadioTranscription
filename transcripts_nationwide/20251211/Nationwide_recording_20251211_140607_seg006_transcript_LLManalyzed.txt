There's a boy I know He's the one I dream of Looks into my eyes Takes me to the clouds above I lose control Can't seem to get enough When I wake from dreaming, tell me, is it really love? How will I know, trust is feeling How will I know How will I know, how will I know? How will I know that he really loves me?
