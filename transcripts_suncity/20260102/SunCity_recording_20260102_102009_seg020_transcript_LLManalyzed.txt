20260102 102009 you have yourself a wonderful 2026. I don't know what is happening. I'm not hearing the track. I'm not here in the track. I doing something wrong, people give me a second. But yeah, 2026 is going to be a wonderful year. And I am grateful, very grateful to be alive, to be here, to still have a job. I am really grateful for every single thing. I am happy to be working at Sun City Radio. I think Sun City gives you the opportunity to do more than just one thing, and that is so important. You get to experience a facet of things. So you can come and talk about, oh, I just produced. No, no, no, no. You have to be able to do at least three things, and I love that.
