And you're ready for the bump and grind Girl, you're so fine You're one of a kind But since you've gone I just can't carry on Just give me one more chance To make it right You're gonna need my love In a lonely night cause I'm your love doctor call me anytime you need me baby I know you like it like this when I kiss you on the lips
