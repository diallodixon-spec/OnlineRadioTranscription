20260102 204421 I have a blue house with a blue window. Blue is the color of all the houses we own. Blue are the streets and all the trees are blue. I have a girlfriend and she is so blue. Blue are the people here that walk around. Blue like my carpet, it's in and outside. Blue are the words I say and what I think. Blue are the feelings, but they live inside me I'm blue, I'm a deed, I'm a die And I'm a deed I'm a die
