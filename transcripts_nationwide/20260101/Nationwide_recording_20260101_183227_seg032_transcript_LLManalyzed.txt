20260101 183227 is a New Year's message from Leader of the Opposition Mark Golding. our strength and resolve in ways none of us could have imagined when our country was devastated by a ferocious Category 5 hurricane on the 28th October. Yet, amidst the intense hardship and destruction, the true spirit of our people shone through. Acts of unspoken bravery in the hurricane saved many lives, only to be followed by a whirlwind of philanthropic generosity as Jamaicans at home and abroad got busy in trying to assist our families and fellow citizens who need our help. Containers and barrels of supplies were packed and sent home like never before.
