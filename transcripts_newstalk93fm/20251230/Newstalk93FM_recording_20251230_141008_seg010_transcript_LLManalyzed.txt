20251230 141008 The greatest pleasure in my life Pretty feathers in disguise Not together we will rise So don't you ever Let me down again Cause I'm depending on you So you better come through this time Please hear my cry and if I ever let you down my friend It was a misunderstanding So if I took you for granted You're not promised from today I go drunk like I never drunk Wait like I never went blind Like I never went before Just to show you I saw it, I saw it And I need you back in my life Look at people by the truck Emotions running high
