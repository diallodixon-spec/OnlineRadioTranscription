2025-12-12 13:29:22 So when the wicked come and find me like a lord, Jesus Christ will come and heal all of the broken heart. Tonight I shall step into the battle field, know that my God is real. I am a fighter, real man, survivor. In Jesus Christ I put my trust. I shall not fail, I shall be there. Jesus Christ, he is my enemy. I am a fighter. We are both survivors. Jesus Christ, I put my trust. I shall not fail. I shall prevail. Jesus Christ, he's my enemy. Many come upon me in false pretence, wolfing us in golden hay, my friends. Jesus Christ, if he directs to me, so I can get me up? See, I just walk, and I'll be afraid. Jesus Christ, he makes me brave.
