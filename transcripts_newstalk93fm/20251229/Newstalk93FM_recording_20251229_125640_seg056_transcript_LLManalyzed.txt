20251229 125640 I know better, it not easy Time testing but I'm strong With love on my mind, loving my thoughts, carrying on Why nobody no believe in a love again? Because every love that lost, nobody no believe In a God again, seems our faith is lost Nobody no believe, and it hurts more Turn the lights on, the world's so dark Still I believe That love is everlasting Yes, I know Love is everlasting, yeah I believe Love is everlasting
