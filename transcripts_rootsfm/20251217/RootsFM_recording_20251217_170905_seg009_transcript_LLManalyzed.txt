20251217 170905 protest in the community yesterday, a day after three men were killed during an alleged confrontation with the police. The early morning protest led to a road being blocked in the area, but police later cleared the roadway and restored order. Speaking with residents, Councillor Lynch appealed for restraint warning against actions that could further disrupt the community. He said while emotions are high residents should avoid unnecessary tension and focus on maintaining the unity that has existed in the area over the years. Lynch encouraged community members to look out for each other and not to allow the incident to overshadow the upcoming festive season. Police say three men were fatally shot after allegedly firing at offices along 41 Boulevard in Rose Heights. Two of the men have been identified as 40-year-old Herman Richards, otherwise called Lizard, and 27-year-old Jerome Witter, otherwise called JJ.
