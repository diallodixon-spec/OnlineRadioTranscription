============================================================

we must rebuild better and we must do this and we must do that. Sure, it would be perfect for us to put every single utility pole underground, all run, all wires underground. But when electricity is 10 times more expensive, then who pays that bill? So the answer to your question is yes, we want to build better, but we also have to be practical and make sure that we build as wisely as possible within the circumstances that we have. We just can't say, well, you mustn't build nothing in Black River too close to the sea, or you mustn't build in wherever because it is not the best place to be. We just have to be practical about it as well.
