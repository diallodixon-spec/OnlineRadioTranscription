20251224 090205 Good morning and welcome to Sports 91 here on NCUFM. I'm Dawson Ho Sang. We kick off with Newton football as Vice President of the Jamaica Football Federation Gregory Daley is set to become the organization's new General Secretary from January 1, 2026. Daley, who currently chairs the JFF's Competitions Committee, is expected to replace Roy Simpson, who has been serving in the role on an interim basis until the end of the year. In cricket, West Indies director Dr. Donovan Bennett believes replacing head coach Darren Sammy would not significantly improve the team's results. The West Indies ended 2025 without a test win under Sammy, following a 2-0 series loss to New Zealand, but Bennett says the team's struggles stem from deeper, long-standing issues.
