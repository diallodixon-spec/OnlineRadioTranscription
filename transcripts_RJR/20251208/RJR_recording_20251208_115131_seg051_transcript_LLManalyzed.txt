Good morning, welcome to Hotline. This is Ty Molyneux. Hello, Molyneux? Yeah, Mr. Molyneux, I'm the person that was talking to you, but I didn't finish because the lawyer said to me that you don't do those kind of matters. So I'm asking you for some assistance on how I can go about it. Well, we'll seek another lawyer. There are lawyers who do that kind of matter, though. All right? Because land matters would require the kind of focus because the laws that are involved set it to a common law and things like that. So check with another lawyer who does that kind of work, right? What is good is that you have your documentation, you have your receipts, yes, for the boning of the state, right? This looks good. And documentary evidence is critical, especially with the transfer transfer of land yes yes called transfer is by what they call by d there and you have been in position how long does someone want to try it out how long yes you've been in possession of the land
