20251222 121412 Well on this tour I think batting your first innings is very key with the usual conditions that you have here with the more difficult wicket to bat on in your first innings in terms of the grass and the movement of the ball. I think that that's something that we've been struggling for a while. I think getting that first innings around 300 or so, that would really play a greater part in us being able to move the game forward in terms of looking for a result or getting the result that we want. So I just think that that's something that we've been trying to work Ross and Chase. The result lifts New Zealand to second on the World Test Championship table while West Indies are left searching for answers after another costly batting failure. Final scores, New Zealand 575 for 8 declared and 306 for 2 declared.
