20251225 112310 Kaboom! One time! Kaboby, Watt House, Walton! Respect you, we call that respect you. C'mon, man has some courtesy that can't hurt you too. Don't bother, bend up your face and walk like you was too. In all your ways, you're not fit up no too too. Police roll you and your eye black can't blue. Said that they teach him just passing too. And enough of manners and enough respect too. Respect you we call that respect.
