20251230 194427 I put you in a Uber And set you to your bed The very next day You sent me a text You pulled up to the crib and we did it again Showed you my little body, showed you my little boo thing And showed you how to fight it, showed you we catchin' moves Every time I f*** what I rock, I f*** on the covers And I kept it on the column, yeah, cause I'm kissin' too You know I never found love until I looked into your eyes First time bashing, I ain't even gon' lie
