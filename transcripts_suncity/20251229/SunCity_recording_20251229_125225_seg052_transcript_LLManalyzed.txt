20251229 125225 I'll keep you safe. I'll stand beside you. I will cross the ocean for you. I will go and bring you back. I will be your hero, your strength, anything you need. And I will be the sun in your sky. I will light your way for all time. I promise you, for you I will. For you I will lay my life on the line For you I will fight For you I will die With every breath, with all my soul
