============================================================

Now let's turn our attention but the skies become mostly sunny. And by 4 PM, you can expect mostly sunny skies, but a temperature of 30 degrees Celsius before conditions turn again around 5 pm with mostly cloudy weather and more showers likely. For those of you who want to catch the sunset it's at 5.32 pm so be sure to set your alarms and you can expect temperatures to start falling steadily after that.
