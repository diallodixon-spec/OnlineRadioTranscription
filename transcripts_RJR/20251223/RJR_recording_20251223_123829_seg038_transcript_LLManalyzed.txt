20251223 123829 Thank you all for keeping us informed and entertained. Blessings from Jillian from the true north and Jillian has sent a freezing emoji. Jillian, you accept our blessings as well and imagine warm hugs. You hear? All right, I know how it can be. Let's think about the warmth. This one says, good afternoon, I will ask you to call out JPS on behalf of the people of Cartyhill, Desire and Jones Hall in Clarendon. We're without electricity since Hurricane Melissa on October 28th. It's a morning to see the citizens are having great challenges.
