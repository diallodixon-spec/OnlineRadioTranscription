20251218 124937 You're here with me right now. Think about you all the time. Now I'm looking in your eyes. Somebody tell me how. Because I would have never had imagined you and I would be rocking with each other. I would have never have imagined you and I, we'd be rocking, with each other. Hey, take my heart and sit down. I feel you ready. Me never know me the future. Your self, it keeps thinking I bet your arm on the fleet, ah. You're such a keeper. Turn it up like a speaker. Pull it up and repeat, oh. As though me know say it's sweet, yo. Cause any time me cross your mind, you would jump in a vehicle. Drive me in a mazouz free picture. I'm gonna feel so good.
