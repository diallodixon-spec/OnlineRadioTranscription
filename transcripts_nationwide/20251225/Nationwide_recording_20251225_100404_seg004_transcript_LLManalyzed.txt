The Christmas story teaches that even in the midst of despair, the Lord our Savior will provide hope and opportunity for renewal and rebirth. Hurricane Melissa poses a crisis of incompatible proportions for Jamaica. But it also presents an incredible opportunity for reset and rebirth. May this season bring peace to your homes, strength to your hearts, and renewed faith in what we can achieve as one people. Let us continue to roll up our sleeves and put one block on top of the other to keep rebuilding our great nation. From my family to yours, I wish you a safe, peaceful, and blessed Christmas and a hopeful and prosperous New Year. God bless you and God bless Jamaica.
