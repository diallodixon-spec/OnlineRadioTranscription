Squeeze my money, juiciness Bumper looking like a apple Biting to the fruitiness Everything fresh, look at the shelf When you come late, everything done sell If you're looking for sweetness to put inside a basket I am the ho, the ho, the whole thinking market And if you're looking for sexy to throw inside a basket I am the hurdy hurdy hood blinking market I'm a market good, pump for pump Your basket full, pump for pump I am the hottest thing on the shelf You don't need to tell me, I'll tell myself If you're looking for sweetness to put inside a basket I am the hot, the hot, hot pink in my kit And if you're looking for sexy to throw inside a basket
