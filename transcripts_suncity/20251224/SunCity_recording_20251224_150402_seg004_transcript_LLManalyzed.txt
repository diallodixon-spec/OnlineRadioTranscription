Tracy, and the customs alone involving the clearance process, you know, even though it's them we tend to talk about. Look at it this way. Shipment delayed, talk to your airline agent. Missing items, talk to your freight forwarder. The charges surprise you now. Call customs, but remember to collect your sign and stamp declaration or C number from your agent. So when you call customs, they can better help you. We're never too old for learning. Some of us know it all. Want when customs roll on your item them now. You mean detain it? But that's only for restricted or prohibited items Tracy. And in such case, make sure you get a notice of detention for the restricted and seizure notice for the prohibited. The information all over them social media pages and them websites Tracy. We have to stay informed as a people you know.
