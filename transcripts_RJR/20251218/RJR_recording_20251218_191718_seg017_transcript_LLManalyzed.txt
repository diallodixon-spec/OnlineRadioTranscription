20251218 191718 I would love to keep the capital here but is it feasible? I think we're going to have to do some serious studies and the introspection and make a decision as to the best way forward. You're not thinking of Santa Cruz as a new capital, so. You know, that's exactly what I'm thinking of but I dare not say it. Well, I would break out. It would. Well, I'm not from St. Elizabeth, so. It absolutely would. So, so I, you know, cockroach and basically I. I will absolutely keep out a lot. But is that a conversation you hear at all, people saying should we rebuild here? Yes, there is that conversation. And I think as has been voiced earlier on this show and elsewhere, I think it's important when you consider rebuilding Black River, what should that look like versus the idea of moving some of your critical institutions perhaps further inland, maybe they can be part of Greater Black River, but certainly not on the waterfront.
