20251216 161813 When I'm with you, I never get enough So why am I not in a rush? I can hear music when you're here Tonight we're rolling, party till closing Since I put the ring on the finger, it's still frozen Love is no motion, I wanna feel you over me Magic in your eyes And it happens every tonight When you won't see me, when you don't see me I'm in West London this evening Give me the feelings, you're not leaving Till I find your land next weekend, peru, nah Girl, I'd rather go find somewhere quiet, you glow
