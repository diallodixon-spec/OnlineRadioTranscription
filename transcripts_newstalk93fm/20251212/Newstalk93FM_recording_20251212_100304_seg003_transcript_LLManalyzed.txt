20251212 100304 I can put my heart up, loving you around. Loving you around, huh? Unplug the alarm now, show you on my card now. I don't need a rich bitch to somebody that can make me feel safe. Yeah, look, I don't want a couple, but nobody ever made me feel safe like you. Because when I'm with you, I just know I'm fine. Know I'm fine. You take all the pressure all the pressure off my mind. Patience and time will not be going out my mind. Say from the problems, I don't worry cause I'm hard to find. Safe like I just ran and slid across the place. Safe like we playing tag and you home base. Safe like I got a big dog in the gate. Safe like you one of these play in my face yeah you know I know you know that I'm that right you got a girl that wanna get right when I pass and I crash you ain't gon' dip right that's when I need you the most that's how I get right, right
