It is not supposed to happen. And I will tell you again, Master Irwin. And God bless you. Have a good weekend. But I am telling you, you are not going to jump on to that bandwagon with your mask on now. But you know, we appreciate it. We have to leave it there though. Thank you very much for the call and do enjoy the rest of the afternoon. All right. This is where we have to leave this edition of Giffey's online. We're bringing it to a close. Bring the curtains down. Thanks to our super producers, Norah Gay Banton, Mr. McCrae Smith, our technical operator, Mr. Kevin Williams, all the hardworking members of the news and production team. I'm Tyrone Reid, sat in for the Erudite Cliffviews today, saying to all of you, have a good afternoon. At the top of the hour, it's all things entertainment until you get down to the flagship program nationwide at 5 at 5 p.m. but before then please pause for a refreshing drink from the scriptures with the oasis have a good afternoon everyone you've just heard Cliff Hughes online with Tyrone Reed
