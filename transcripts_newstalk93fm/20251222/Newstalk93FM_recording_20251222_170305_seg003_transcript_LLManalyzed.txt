20251222 170305 I don't care, I don't care I don't care if you're pretty or not I don't care We are the island I don't care Tell you I'm if I don't come home in the morning Just know that I say, it's not in my place But this mass of a hole in me, I can't leave, until every single bottle done. If anyone looking for me, then you can find me. We're bound for changing, higher beating, people fighting, so complain. If they want to know, tell them you can find me out on the road.
