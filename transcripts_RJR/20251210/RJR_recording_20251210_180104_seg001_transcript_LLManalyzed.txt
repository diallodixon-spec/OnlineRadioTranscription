Good evening, I'm Deidre Ann Gordon with the latest Rated Jamaica News. The police are making arrangements to question a man who was caught abducting a six-year-old girl in Maypen, Clarendon yesterday. The child, a student of the St. Thomas More Prep School in Maypen, was reported missing from school about 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday. Just over two hours later, she was found in the company of a man on Glenmure Road near the intersection of the Bustamante Highway. The man was accosted and held by a former Maypen mayor and People's National Party councillor, CN Barnswell. A photo of the politician arresting the suspect has been circulating on social media. He later handed him over to the police. This is an audio of Mr. Barnswell and his wife recounting the dramatic incident.
