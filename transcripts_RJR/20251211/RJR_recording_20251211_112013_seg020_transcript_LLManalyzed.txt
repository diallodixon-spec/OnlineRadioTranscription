I have asked the minister, and I see no reason why he cannot share with the country the actual communication, because I think that's where the problem started. I could not imagine the response from JPSCO when they got that letter from the minister, because I think it's reasonable that those terms would not continue. And as I had indicated in 2015, and people make it out as if changing terms of license has to await some particular date. When I was changing the telecom license, we had 38 more years to run on it. The company, I believe, got a letter that frightened them, and I want to see exactly what the letter says, because, again, I can't imagine why they would have responded that way.
