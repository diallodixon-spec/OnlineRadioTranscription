============================================================

Since the hurricane, I now become a casual listener. I'm living in Ontario, Canada. Originally, my family background is from St. Thomas. Many, many years ago, my brother used to live in Falmouth. We had a studio by the name of Graham Photo Studio near to the market in Falmouth. His wife died and left behind two young children. Oh, they are sad. My brother left the children with their grandmother and returned to St. Thomas. He did not take care of his children or return to know how they are doing. It hurts to know that some place out there are family members that might be in need, especially in this time. I don't know their names, but if you can please help me get in touch with them. I'd appreciate it. Thank you. God bless. I provided your name and your number. I'm going to also produce it. Make a note of this. You can also pass on to Rolston. So, Rolston McKenzie is very good at this. They're bringing people together. So, we will do that for you.
