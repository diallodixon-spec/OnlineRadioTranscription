You don't want to hear the price of the people they put on or something. But matters worse, me hear say half of the thing they missing. And me know say her customs. Girl, how you know say her customs? Lisa stop going like you don't have no sense, man. You know say everybody that talk about it in the media. You don't want me to stop listening to you Sir. Have you ever experienced that? Customs don't go into your package, suitcase, barrel or cargo unless you ship the item or the agent stand up right there when they inspect it. Listen, Customs job is to protect the borders, collect revenue and to facilitate trade. They don't collect or store shipment, they inspect it and somebody has to present it for inspection. So how Customs ever get so much custom then? Tracy, and the Customs alone involved in the clearance process even though they were ten foot tall.
