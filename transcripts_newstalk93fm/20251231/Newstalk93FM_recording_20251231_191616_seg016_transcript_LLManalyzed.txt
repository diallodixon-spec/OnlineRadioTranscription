20251231 191616 So let me see your hands up in the air Wave them up in the band People from everywhere Welcome down to the land of the party We love to party Cause life is for the living, we livin' it A chance is to be given, we givin' it So don't be late, the truck heaven can't wait We are team to celebrate, I'm telling you Hard work without the smart work, it's not work We don't want no batter that I need, a liquor breeder Two days on the road, make some jam in the middle Dice the rum, we need to find the middle For the sake of peace of mind So the metal Of the world is bare You'll frighten me and my friend and them because We move so hard So hard For a week We deserve a party She deserves a party
