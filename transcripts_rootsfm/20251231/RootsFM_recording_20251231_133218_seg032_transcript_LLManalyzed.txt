20251231 133218 But me and Stacey, we're just cool Can't understand how we're tied So yeah, I swear there's nothing going on True, there's no sad discords But always there to help me when I'm down Worst when they see us holding hands And laughing together Probably thinking we're making plans To run off together Can't't see we're just friends. They say I'm going in my lady. Some criticizers say, me have me cake on any day. Make it seem we're just friends, they say I'm secretly loving you. Oh, no. They say we could have never lived so, I'm happy now. Well, every time when I talk to a woman over here, everybody claims And it won't open the door or pull out the chair And when me cousin and me auntie come take me from here
