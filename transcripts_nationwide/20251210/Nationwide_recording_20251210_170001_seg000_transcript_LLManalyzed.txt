podcast is all about providing men with a healthy, safe and functional forum to tackle many of the taboo topics that concern overmasculinity. Like everyone else out there, we're dads of varying amounts of experience who called Jamaica. Too often, there are no safe spaces for men to explore the issues which are important to us. Plus, most of the content out there about parenthood is produced by women, for women. So we think it is important that we be the change we want to see. Follow us on YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter at Jamaican Dads with a Z. And definitely join us here on Nationwide 90FM every Thursday at 8 p.m. with a repeat on Sundays at 6 p Ready to tackle that building project? Start right. Start here at HNL
