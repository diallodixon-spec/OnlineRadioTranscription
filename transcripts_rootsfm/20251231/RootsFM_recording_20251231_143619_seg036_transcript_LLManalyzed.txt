20251231 143619 You're listening to Roots 96.1 FM. Looking at the ladies All of them fine All of them so lovely I can't make up my mind But I'm looking at you from the corner of my eye. I can see you now, you're stepping so high and high. Walking down the street and watching ladies go by watching you. One look and I was hooked on you, baby.
