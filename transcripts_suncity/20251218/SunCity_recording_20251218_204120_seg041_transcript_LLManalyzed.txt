20251218 204120 I thought some time along Was what we really needed You said this time would hurt more than it helps But I couldn't see that I thought it was the end Of a beautiful story And so I left the one I love at home To be alone And I tried and found out this one thing is true That I'm nothing without you I know better now And I've had a change of heart I'd rather have bad times with you Than good times with someone else I'd rather be beside you in a storm
