It comes down to time and place. So it's appropriate there because it's a festival or lack of a better word. It's not appropriate there. How me can't talk to you on a regular. I ask if Patrick look carnivalish. When you go carnival. You say girl, when you see out there, do you approach them? That acts like they don't, they can't talk to them. I ask you Sophie, him look like him put on feather and glitter. Him look like, him not do that. Him not got carnival. Him go, but him not go put on them something there. All me know carnival is glitter and feather. I don't know, I don't know. Maria said it is appropriate. It is appropriate for carnival. Now, how?
