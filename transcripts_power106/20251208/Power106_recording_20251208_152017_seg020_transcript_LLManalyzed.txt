from six to $12,000. And of course you would have the legal fees. Sometimes too, they may ask for a substantiating document. So this could be perhaps your birth certificate, which would have the correct spelling. So go ahead and get that done as soon as possible. It's best to do it now. You know, don't wait until let's say you're getting a mortgage or you're selling the property. like i said before if you're doing it with another transaction it may cost that transaction to take um to take a longer time and and let me just say as much as possible when you're buying property especially if you have multiple properties um please ensure that your name is consistent on every title you know know you may have an E missing on one title, one title may have your maiden name, another title may have your married name, you know you may have your middle name as your first name, whatever. But just double check all your documents to make sure
