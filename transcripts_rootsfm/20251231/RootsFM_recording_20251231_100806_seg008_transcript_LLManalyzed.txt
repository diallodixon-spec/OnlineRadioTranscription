20251231 100806 Hey, hey, hey, hey. Grand Rising, family. Grand Rising. This is Routesology, your first edutainment classroom on air, anywhere in the hemisphere, with your CG, your caregiver, Denise Isis, Isis, Iisis, Mila, some say Empress, some say Princess, some say Queen, some even say Routesologist. Hailing upon my lions and my lionesses in the concrete jungle. May the fittest of the fittest survive in this time. Mentally, physically, spiritually, emotionally, musically, magically, and of course by and on shally-ally-ally-o. On this here Wellness Wednesday, I am well if you are well. It's the eve! It's the eve. 31st of what? December 2025. Last day in the month of 2025. What a vibe.
