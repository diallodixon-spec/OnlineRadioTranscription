Who did it, make up your face like you're getting robbed Alright stop, make a pose, take a sip, shake your foot Start doing it, working it Everybody fifth and fourth and deep, working it Everybody fear, do the work in it Everybody fear to move till they work in it Work in it, work in it, workin it, workin in it So I never dream, that I'm going to live to die All the time that someone leave my heart behind It makes me fight, I fight Anywhere I go, the girl dem love me Like a four wheeled club, I'm a lucky guy
