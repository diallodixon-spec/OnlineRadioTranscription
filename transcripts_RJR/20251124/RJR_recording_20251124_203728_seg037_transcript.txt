============================================================

So nice to be with you Each time that I give my heart to someone new It just turns blue But this time, it's my time It's my time, it's my time. It's all the time I have to be with you. So please, never go away. Say you don't understand. And I'll make my dreams come true It's so nice to be with you It's so nice, to be with you
