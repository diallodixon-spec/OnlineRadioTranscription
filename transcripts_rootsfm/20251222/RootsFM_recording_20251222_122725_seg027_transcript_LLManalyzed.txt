20251222 122725 Christmas day I just want you for my own More than you could ever know Make my wish come true All I want for Christmas is you You, baby Oh, I won't ask for much this Christmas I won't even wish for snow I'm just gonna keep on waiting Underneath the mistletoe I won't make a list and send it To the North Pole for sinning I won't even stay awake to Hear the magic rain display Oh, oh, oh, oh.
