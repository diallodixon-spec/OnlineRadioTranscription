20251226 134134 Yesterday you walked away With no thought of today Thinking you could go along Not remembering where you're from But it's too late now All the doors are closed You just don't know how the love feels I gave you everything I've got Now you're coming back It seems like you're running out of stock, baby You gave everything I've got, now you're coming back It seems like you're running out of stock, baby You never know what tomorrow will bring Beyond what they could ask, there are visions of many things
