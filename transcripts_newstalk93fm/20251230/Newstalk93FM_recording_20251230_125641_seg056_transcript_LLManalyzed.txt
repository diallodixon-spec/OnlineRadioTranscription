20251230 125641 So now, louder than the loudest thunder, higher than the highest wonder, you're the answer to my prayers. You are, you are, you are. You're the... Answer to my prayers. More than a wish upon a star, you're the......answer to my prayers. Was a dream, now reality. True love is here with me. You are, you are, you are. You're the, you're the answer to me. I love you so, never gonna let you go. I wonder what to know, if I said to prayers. Loving you so loud, louder than the loudest. Higher than the highest. The answer to my prayers."
