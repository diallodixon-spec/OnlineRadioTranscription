20251222 152214 Afterglow, leave your body golden like the sun in the moon You're afraid, you're not alone, I've not been front to this It's been a test to find us, you love it But we'll not be front to this It was a test to find that we'll survive Until the time they can't deny our love They can't divide us, we'll survive it Taste the time, it's true that I've been right here Something next to you, next to you Standing in the bayonets to you You know it's deeper than the rain It's deeper than the pain When it's deep like DNA Something they can can't take away, hey Tick, tick, tick, tick tickle, tickle Standing next to you Standing next to you
