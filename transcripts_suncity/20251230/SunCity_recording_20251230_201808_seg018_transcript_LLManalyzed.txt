20251230 201808 With love and unity we are for sure Those who struggle will rise from the fall Jamaica people, one and all Hear the call, hear the call Sweet, sweet Jamaica From the hills to the sea, let love be the key. Together we're strong, one family. Sweet, sweet Jamaica. The sun will shine, the pain will fade. We'll rise again, not afraid. We see the youth and every elder's neighbors come together. Love gets stronger, no light, but still we see we see if no food or water we have plenty of food we throw down the island vibes spirit of the pink we're still alive we rebuilt with hearts and pride one love one step side
