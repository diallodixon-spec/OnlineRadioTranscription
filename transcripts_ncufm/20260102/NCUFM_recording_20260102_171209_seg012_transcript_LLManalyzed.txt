20260102 171209 It's not enough For all that I believe They never change the way it is Unless I believe Jesus lives Where there is faith There is a voice calling, keep walking You're not alone in this world There is faith, there is a peace like a child sleeping Hope everlasting in me Who is able to bear every burden To heal every hurt in my heart
