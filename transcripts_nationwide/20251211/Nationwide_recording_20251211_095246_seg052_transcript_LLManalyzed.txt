because of the hurricane. We're now residing in another town, Santa Cruz area. And we went to a full service office that Flo has and requested for our service address to be relocated. They're telling us that they're not taking on any new customers at this time. But I say, we're not new customers. We are existing customers for 10 years. We just want the service address to be relocated. They're not taking on any new installation. So I want to know if this is an official position of Flow or these people are just taking matters in their own hands. And we had a full package with cable TV and internet and everything. Flow is the only telecoms provider in your area? Well, full service when it comes on to internet. So far, thanks to Mr.
