operating like a country within a country okay now if you come and you say they have never they've been the enemy of the country and you need now to really go to Parliament dissolve all of that status that they have I have the right to ask you to what end. You can't just go to some of the yard and say I'm dissolving you as the father of these children. What are you going to do with the children? You can't just leave them there, you can't just leave a compound of the other Maroon communities, you can't just get up and say that's dissolved and I think that's precisely why I think having soldiers and police into that area is symbolic and I think that is why Corey said no thank you
