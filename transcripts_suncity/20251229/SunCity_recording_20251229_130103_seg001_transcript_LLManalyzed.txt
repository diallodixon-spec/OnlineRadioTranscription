20251229 130103 Symphony To show you there's nothing I won't do Maybe I'll walk around and shine a wall for you If there's a way I do love for you Anything you want me to You know I'll do Do do do do, do do do do. I'll travel around the seven seas for you It's written in the melody I wrote Oh, I wrote my love a symphony
