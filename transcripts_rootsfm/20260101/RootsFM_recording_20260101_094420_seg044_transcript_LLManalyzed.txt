20260101 094420 It's getting late. I'm making my way over to my favorite place. I gotta get my body moving, shake the stress away. I wasn't looking for nobody when you looked my way. Possible candidate, yeah. Who knew that you'd be up in here looking like you do? You make staying overin' over here impossible Baby, I'ma say your aura is incredible If you don't have to go, don't Do you know what you started? I just came here to party But now we're rockin' on the dance floor at tonighty Your hands around my waist Just let the music play We're hand in hand Just to trust And now we're face to face I wanna take you away Let the tape into the music DJ, let it play I just can't refuse it Like the way you do Just keep on rockin' through it
