20251218 114631 you're talking about responsible behavior. And so it has to also include the management of the shelter, which as I was saying earlier, it needs to happen that the women and children, especially perhaps in a different section and the males in a different section. And then you can have that kind of a separation and the response to behavior of when the condoms are there and they need to do what they have to do. They go where they, you know, it's not open to everybody to be exposed. To my mind, that is responsible behavior, including the administrators of the shelters. Great, great, great, great. Dr. Garvey, it's always a pleasure. I want to wish you all the best for the Christmas season and indeed for 2026. Always a pleasure and thanks for responding to our calls whenever we ask. We are definitely indebted to you.
