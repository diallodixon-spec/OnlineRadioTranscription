2025-12-12 09:09:08 Make me lose my breath, make me water Normally I can keep my cool but tonight I'm wildin' I'ma be In a dangerous mood, can you match my timing? Telling me That you're really about it, why'd you hide it? Talk is cheap So show me Set off my whole body If I give you my time Can you stretch my soul from it? If I don't wanna wait, I'll take it Take me where I ain't been before
