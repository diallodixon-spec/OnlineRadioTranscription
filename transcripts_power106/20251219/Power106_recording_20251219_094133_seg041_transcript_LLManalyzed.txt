20251219 094133 I think it's in the hands of the BOJ at this particular point in time. She hasn't had a long time to do that. Pardon me? Yes, absolutely. So there are questions that have to be asked. Why has there been no intervention? Why is the BOJ working in futility? What does the BOJ reduction or increase in rates have to do with anything in the economy right now? Because it has no effect. I don't know how is it that what the BOJ does in terms of the increase or decrease in the rate impacts the economy because the other part that's supposed to react is not reacting so therefore money supply keeps being expensive. So the other party that is responsible they do not want to rehabilitate the economy? Well you know what I wouldn't even go as far as to say do not want rehabilitate the economy
