Alright Isis, that's it from us here, me and Auntie Susie in the Puffin Market. And you will hear me again at 12.30 for the Midday News. Alright, sounds good to me. Take care now. Okay, Market Basket. One basket, we'll get this one from Adira, Adira Truth, right? And Auntie Susie, those prices are pretty reasonable, I must say, they are. And so, she buys from Auntie Susie pretty regularly. And so yeah, she has a good relationship with her. I think I know who Auntie Susie is. You know, the other day I had to go into the market to buy some fruits for one of my friends who was in the hospital. And she was on the right hand side. I got some oranges, right? As you go in, the oranges were really sweet and really good. And I think I got some grapes as well from Auntie Susie. So that's a poppine. I wonder where we're going next week. Last week we were in Crossroads. And the week before for a couple of weeks we've been in Donato. Yeah, Donato. You know, Donato. Right?
