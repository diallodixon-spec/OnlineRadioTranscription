20251230 203918 I'm the first lady in my life, a girl that we understand. Special dedication to the big woman. From your love,, mama. Proud of your mama. Sing a lull for your mama. Yeah. How make she know you're happy? She bring you, come here. From your heart, help me sing this one. From your love for mama like this, man. There's no one like my mama. No, no. Mama never had it easy at times. She cries on magic rides. Many days I don't know how we survive. She's in a worry it will be fine. We end on cause of Mama's teachings. And in the scriptures she plays her beliefs in you. We'll take it from you.
