I asked within the context of a concern that consumers will have about being charged higher bills to facilitate the repayment of this loan. So that's my first question. Well, remember the terms of the loan to JPS is five years at five and a half percent. Can you indicate which government agency is the official agency providing the loan? Ministry of Finance and the Public Service.
