20260101 104323 Because we're living in a world of fools Breaking us down When they all should let us be We belong to you and me La la la la la la... La la la la, la la la la La la la la... If you come to me by the summer breeze Keep me warm in your love, in your song Let me know when it's me you need to share I'll be with you, love, it's your love I'll give it to you, love I'll be with me, it's a love
