20251215 212515 When you talk to the boy, you just level your tone. Level your tone, like a yellow cheat, they're on the phone. When you're out in Japan, look up in a something with chrome. Still they hit you up in the head like when you hear a comb. Them badness are meant like a creamy cone. Creamy cone, anybody they decide on the tone. Them they pump it with level, they blow me out the boat. Anytime we make a step, they never get free report. All them bits, everything off the bones. Napata with the new dip, dancing stitch. Lead by your mind like a jockey with a whip. Talk to me nice, don't make your mouth slip. No freedom of speech when you're talking. It's a new start, it's a new beginning. You can't show me how to fly cocky water, yeah man? You're bigger than my skin, can't compare to them, you know? Bigger you, bigger you, bigger you. All right, see that? All right. What's the skin attack?
