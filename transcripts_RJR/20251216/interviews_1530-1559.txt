Trudy Greenland, Co-Founder of Just Natural Hair Studio, Shares Insights on Natural Hair Care and Embracing One's Natural Beauty

In a recent interview on Radio Jamaica 94 FM, Trudy Greenland, co-founder and natural hair stylist of Just Natural Hair Studio, shared her expertise and passion for natural hair care. With over 26 years of experience in the industry, Trudy has become a leading authority on natural hair care and education in Jamaica.

Trudy's journey in natural hair care began when she was just a couple of years old, growing up in an orthodox family where locks were a part of her culture. She started locking her hair in high school and eventually decided to pursue a career in natural hair care. Trudy recalled the challenges she faced in finding a salon that catered to natural hair, which led her to start her own business, Just Natural Hair Studio.

When asked about the general attitude towards natural femininity, Trudy shared her observations on how people's perceptions have changed over the years. "I think people have become more embracing of their natural self," she said. "Education is a big part of what we do, and we try to educate our clients on how to care for their hair, not just when they're in the salon, but also at home."

Trudy emphasized the importance of maintaining healthy hair habits, such as keeping the scalp clean, moisturizing, and protecting the hair from damage. She also addressed common misconceptions about natural hair, such as the idea that it's difficult to manage or style. "We need to tap into the use of words and how we use them based on what we think we want," she said. "For example, the word 'styling' is often overused, and people don't understand that it's not just about washing and conditioning, but also about grooming and maintaining the hair."

Trudy's passion for natural hair care is evident in her work, and she has inspired many people to embrace their natural beauty. When asked about her team, Trudy expressed her pride in their dedication and hard work. "Teamwork made the dream work," she said. "We're not perfect, but we try our best to make sure that the work we produce speaks volumes."

Just Natural Hair Studio has grown beyond its initial location, with a second location in Portmore and international pop-ups. Trudy attributes the growth of her business to her commitment to providing excellent service and educating her clients on natural hair care. When asked about her plans for the future, Trudy said, "Bigger and better things are coming next year. We're going to make sure that people know where to find us."

Trudy's story is a testament to the power of embracing one's natural beauty and pursuing one's passion. Her dedication to natural hair care has inspired a movement, and her business continues to thrive. As Trudy said, "When you love what you do, and you put your heart into it, it's an excellent business."
