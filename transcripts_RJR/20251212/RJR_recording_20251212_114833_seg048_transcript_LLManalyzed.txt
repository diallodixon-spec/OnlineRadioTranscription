What we have done is all the western branches across Jamaica, meaning in the parishes of Trelawny, St. Elizabeth and St. James, Westmoreland as well, you can go to any of our branches. There's Fairview branch, Mandeville branch, Christiana branch, Falmouth, Port Maria junction. You can go, there's a box there that you can actually complete the entries and drop it in the box. And then if you're anywhere else in the country and you have access to the internet, you can go onto our website and make a wish. It's www.jntb.com slash grant a wish. And all you have to do is just state in less than a hundred words what you wish for, why do you wish for that. Then we have a selection committee. We review all the wishes and then we will grant wishes. not sure how many we'll grant because depending on the wishes whatever the money yeah right you you have a cap on the value of the wish we can make I can put a cap on it you know you know why because Emily I believe that is something that you have to look at and see what we didn't need
