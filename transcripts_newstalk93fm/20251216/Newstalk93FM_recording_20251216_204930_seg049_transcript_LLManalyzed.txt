When the film and I kill woman and child When the new world gets so ungrinder So we did stay from the beginning of time But I get sacrificed for them family move up in a line When they talk you to me get crucified you afraid Bitch a perfect living a lie Try to know it's so sad Nobody no believe in a love again Because they love that lost Nobody no believe in afraid again I'll be stopping now, I can't let you wrong Nobody no liar and it hurts my heart Still a heart for one and one for all Still I believe at love again
