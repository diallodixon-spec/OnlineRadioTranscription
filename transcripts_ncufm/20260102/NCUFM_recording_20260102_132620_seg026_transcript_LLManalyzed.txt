20260102 132620 I can't even turn on my phone without being reminded of the lie that I am alone and broke and unsuccessful. I can't always talk to my friends because they've got expectations that I may or may not be living up to. I really need to rid myself of the pressure, pressure, pressure to be someone else that the world has made. Jesus, take from me all the push, push, push to be someone that you did not create Help me, be me, and only see you then
