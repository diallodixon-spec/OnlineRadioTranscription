20260101 211307 The feeling ain't the same by myself calling her your name ladies. Tell me do you understand? It's too 11 days, umpteen hours I'ma be burning to your return When you're feeling it, it's the same in your body Don't want to, cause you know that I let it go Cause the party ain't usually what you're used to Let it burn, let it burn, go burn, burn, burn Deep down you know it's best when someone's with you Ain't the thought of a beat when someone loves you Know that it's over, know it's over
