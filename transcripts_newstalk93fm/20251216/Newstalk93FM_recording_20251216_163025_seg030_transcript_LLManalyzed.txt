20251216 163025 I'm a bee In a dangerous mood, can you match my timing? Telling me That you're really about it, why'd you hide it? Talk is cheap So show me That you understand how I like it Can you blow my mind? Set off my whole body If I give you my time Can you stretch my soul from it? I don't wanna wait Don't it. Take me where I ain't been before. Can you blow my mind? Set off my whole body, whole body.
