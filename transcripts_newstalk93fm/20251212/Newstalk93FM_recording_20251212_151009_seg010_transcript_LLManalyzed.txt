20251212 151009 Let you down, my friend. It was a misunderstanding. So if I took it for granted, then I promise from today I'll go drunk like I never drunk. Wave like I never wave. Wine like I never won before. Just to show you I'm sorry. I'm sorry. And I need you back in my life. Look at people buying a truck. Emotions running high. We're up in the sky down we high Can't you tell that we solid We solid And we need you back in we high This is my apology, follow me, come and see what you mean
