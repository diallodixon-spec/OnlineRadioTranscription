20251226 175243 Never get you down There's always something I can do Because I wouldn't ever want to see you frown I'll always do what's best for you There ain't no mistaking It's true that I will make it Something to last for all time It's never changing As you hear me I'm saying I want you for the rest of my life Together forever and ever too far Together forever we two And don't you know I would move heaven and earth To be together for ever with you
