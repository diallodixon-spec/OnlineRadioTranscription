20260101 183920 I'm trying to get to you To you, to you, to you To break the walls away Is as obvious as the colors of your hair And would you believe that I really care? Cause I'm tryin' to get to you to you to you oh i tried writing letters but they all came back unopened guess who thought you'd be the same old thing again oh i tried telephoning every time it rang I was wishing Don't you thought you'd hear the same old thing again? Girl, you're not alone And would you believe I have lost my way back?
