20251222 145137 I grew up at a time when I heard I could relate to some people saying that they had to put a different address on an application form, because for them, that community would not have gotten them the job. If somebody said, you know, looked at the form and saw what it's where from, so they'd label them because of the address. How about you family members on the WhatsApp line? Talk to us. Have you ever been labeled because of where you're from? Some of you who live overseas should be able to relate to that. Because people look at you and say, where are you from? Jamaica? And they label you.
