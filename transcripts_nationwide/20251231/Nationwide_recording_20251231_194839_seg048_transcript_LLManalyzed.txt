20251231 194839 Baby, I have no story to be told But I've heard one on you and I'm gonna make your head burn Think of me in the depths of your despair Making home down there as mine sure won't be shared The scars of your love remind me of us They keep me thinking if we almost had it all The scars of you love, they leave me dead Plus I can't help feeling We could have had it fun, fun in the deep You have my heart inside, yeah And we played it to the tune
