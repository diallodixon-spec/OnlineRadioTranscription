20251224 115242 to people, you know, who listen to the program, who are family members or friends or whatever, no matter. Simon, happy holidays. Can you please say why NWC is pressuring us? The customers have billed you on November 8, paid by checks on November 7, and they say you must, you must what? Drop it in a box and come back for a receipt another day. And then the NWC charge the late fee. It is not fair, no it isn't fair. But don't just accept it. Complain, go in and complain. Ask to see a manager, ask to see a supervisor. I'm going to do the same thing with Digicel. Just before the hurricane, like two days before the hurricane, I lost my service. And then obviously throughout the hurricane, so for about three weeks, I'm without my Wi-Fi service. And then I get a bill, and it's a full normal bill.
