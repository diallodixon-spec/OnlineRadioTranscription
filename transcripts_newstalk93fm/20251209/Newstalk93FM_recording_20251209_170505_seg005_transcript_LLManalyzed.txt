And it's much a big place, and I defect like a jumbo. And to one way, they don't want me in their prozine. They don't want me cause I do one way. They don't wanna me in their prosine. I don't listen, nothing to say. Every time I try, jumping up, doing what I want. Jumping up, tell them I ain't leaving. Right there, sleeping. Every time I jump, jumping up. Doing what I want. They say I'm too out of control But there's too much action Somebody pour an extra Until my head's gone And I'm miserable All down on the ground I'm causing trouble Look how these security watch me They don't know about me Handles much of it
