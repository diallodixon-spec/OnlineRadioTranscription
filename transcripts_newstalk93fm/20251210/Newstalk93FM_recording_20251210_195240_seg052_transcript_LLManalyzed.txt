============================================================

I don't live my life with regrets No, I come to jam on a bumper Come to drink on a liquor Until my head gone and I'm miserable Hold on Monty Crone, I'm causing trouble Look how these security are watching me They don't know I'm out there I just mush up the place and I deep breath like I'm jumping And you want me? They don't want me in their party day They don't want because I do one way Go back, go back, go back till the feeling come again. So high like a snow now. Time to feel the feeling again. All over.
