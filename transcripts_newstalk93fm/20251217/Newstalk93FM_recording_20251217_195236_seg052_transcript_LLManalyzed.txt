20251217 195236 Don't let me down easy If you're gonna leave me, baby, go and leave me all the way If it's over, it's over, so f*** it Just don't act like my love wasn't nothing Like I wasn't the one you was holding that night Telling all of your secrets to hug you Guess you're right, it's too good to be true What's important, all I needed was you But time after time, I just fuss and then fight Next time that you do what you do And it's cool Mama said it was fish in the sea, I got lost in the pool Knew it was coming. I watched how you moved. How you turned back on me and laid me to lose. Remember the text, how you said that you do. Said that you'll never leave. We will fight till it's due. But as it went on, I was fighting for you. Said the text turned green. Why the fuck it ain't blue? And she done and I get it. Said you stand, you wanted my name, and you left. So I'm guessing that you never meant it. Said you trying hard on because the load was so strong. Now I'm standing alone in this kitchen. Singing sad songs, but I'm knowing that this don't last long. If you leaving, then leave, because leave me all the way Don't ask for all your things back Cussing out my name yeah
