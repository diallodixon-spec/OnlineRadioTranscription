20260102 200308 They don't know where to look for hope. These young people need to hear the gospel of Jesus Christ. For there is hope in the Lord. Hope in King Jesus. And our young people here in our country also need to know about Christ Jesus the Savior. There is hope only in Jesus all around the world. There is absolute chaos and hopelessness and helplessness. Christ wants us to see that he is our only source of hope, of the Spirit and belief of the truth. Therefore stand fast. If you serve God faithfully, you will meet with prejudice and opposition, but do not become provoked when you suffer wrongfully. Do not retaliate.
