20251215 153026 Now in the YouTube episode which aired on December 14, the artist whose real name is Anthony Clark raised the concerns about the rise of artificial intelligence in the industry. He shared his views on the present state of the annual Sting Festival and also emphasized the importance of substance in dancehall music, encouraging artists to go beyond rhymes. His critique focuses not just on basic rhymes, but on the intellectual and creative use of language, you know, figures of speech, an area he feels the current offerings are lacking in. The discussion also zoned in on the current clashes involving dancehall artist Massica and Tommy Lee, among others. Devin expressed that he has yet to hear anything impressive and believes the whole clash can wrap up now. Devin also asserted that the King of Dancehall vibes Cartel has already solidified his legacy and has nothing to prove in a potential clash with Massica. Beyond the critique of his contemporaries, Devin also opened up about about his own growth and enduring love for the craft. Yeah, it was a pretty solid episode. Okay, we have a clip.
