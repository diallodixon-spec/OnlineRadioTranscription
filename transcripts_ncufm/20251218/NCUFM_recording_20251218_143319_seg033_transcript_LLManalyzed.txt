20251218 143319 Heavenly Father, thank you for this day. Help our lives to reflect your light in a way that brings glory to you and teach us to live with integrity that encourages, inspires and points others to you. May our actions speak truth even when words fall short. Use our lives as testimonies of your grace in your name. Amen. And that's it for Daily Devotion this afternoon. It comes your way at 2.30 Monday through to Friday on The Drive. It's a beautiful song. This is a beautiful song that I love to listen to when I'm in those moments where, you know where certain things from your past, they replay. They replay because sometimes the devil uses your past to affect your future. That's where you use his future. Your nature is to remind you of your past, to remind him of his future.
