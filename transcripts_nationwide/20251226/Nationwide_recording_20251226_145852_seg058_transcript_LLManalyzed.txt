20251226 145852 Do you think time won't pass me by? Do you know I'd walk a thousand miles if I could just see you tonight? There's always times like these when I think of you I wonder if you ever think of me Is everything so wrong that I don't belong Living in your precious memory? I hopped off the plane at LAX With a dream, my cardigan Welcome to the land of fame and sex Am I gonna fit in? Jumped in the cab, here I am for the first time Up to my right and I see the Hollywood sign This is all so crazy Everybody seems so famous My tummy's hurting and I'm feeling kinda homesick too
