20251212 182712 You are the sun after the rain With your strength to rebuild Through the heartache and pain In whispered calm Your gentle voice leads us on Guiding us through nights that seem so wrong Your kindness like a lighthouse Casting its glow I'm gonna fly down! With your steadfast hope We'll find our way and stay Jamaica, we'll find a light Through shadows cast away Together we'll be strong As the clouds begin to sway Jamaica, you will find your way
