20251216 105745 George Wright was one of the man who was advocating for that land thing to rectify that the people couldn't get some. And tell me what happened. Why are you the word that you have to be, you must not have any sense. The PMC went around and tell them that they must cooperate with the government because they want to take over the land. And that's why I said to you that one of the criteria that people have to be you have to be an idiot. I'm sure that I'm sure I'm sure a lot of people wouldn't agree with you. Including the PNP people. You believe if everything you do in your workplace, everybody agree with you. No, no. No, no, no. Not at all. No, they wouldn't be relevant. Somebody coming out. Somebody not effect everybody when you agree with me. Mm hmm. Right. But you're harder than the PNP man. You're very hard on them.
