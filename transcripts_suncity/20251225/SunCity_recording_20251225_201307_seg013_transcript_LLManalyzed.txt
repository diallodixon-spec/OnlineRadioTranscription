20251225 201307 Make my wish come true. All I want for Christmas is you. I don't want a lot for Christmas There is just one thing I need And I don't care about the present Underneath the Christmas tree I don't need a name like stocking Live upon the fireplace Santa Claus won't make me happy With a toy on Christmas day I just want you for my own More than you could ever know Make my wish come true
