I didn't see any way possible that that would happen. You were good at school? You were good in school? I think average. I wouldn't say good because with all my challenges, I had to have some sort of natural, some sort of natural ability. I didn't have any natural ability. I had to work at it. Okay. So at that time now, the woman who had the two children from my dad, she had migrated, but still advocating for me, like telling this man, are you going to leave her in Jamaica? She's going to mash up, you're going to mash up. Do something for her. And that's when they sent a letter. In those days, you could get a letter to go to the embassy and to my surprise they gave me a visa. So you went to the States to stay with who? To stay with that same woman, the one who advocated for me. But naturally by then now I'm 18 years old going on 19 and you can't tell me anything.
