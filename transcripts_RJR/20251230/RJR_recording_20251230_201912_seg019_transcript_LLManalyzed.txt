20251230 201912 My body's in trouble And you're the one I need Is it how you walk Is it how you talk Or is it how you smile That make me come alive I wanna know what it is about you Cause every little thing That I've been searching for Girl I see it in you You're my dream come true Every single day in every little way Every single night I pray That you'll be there for me Cause I'll be there for you Is it how you walk? Is it how you talk? Or is it how you smile that make me come alive? I wanna know what it is about you Can we go for a walk? And have a little talk? So I can get to know you
