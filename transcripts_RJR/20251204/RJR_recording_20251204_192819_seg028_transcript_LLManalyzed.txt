first interview with her in January this year and let's see Christine says great program this teacher story is so similar to mine the only difference that my subject is history and I was good at good at it from the outset she said I taught some footballers in grade 11 it was like pulling teeth at hardly any interest their self-esteem was very low I worked with those students and they passed. I engaged them. I prepared for every lesson, but most importantly, I cared about them. Some teachers today are in the classroom for the wrong reasons. That's another discussion. Jonathan St. Catherine says his teacher is giving me goosebumps. We need more teachers like these in our classes. These teachers make students can't wait for school to reopen. Thank you all so much. I'm so glad you enjoyed that interview. I enjoyed it just listening to it all over again. And yes, you know, just remind us of how important and how inspirational our teachers can be.
