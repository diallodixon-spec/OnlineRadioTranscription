Hi, my name's Talia. I'm a flight attendant with British Airways, and when I'm travelling all over the world, I bring San City Radio with me. Buy the website on www.sancityradio.fm or the app TuneIn.com or Radioarden. Keep it locked to 104.9 FM. at the World Football Championship. It's the finals where World Radio United goes up against Sun City.
