20251215 132628 Well, bright and ting, the sun in the morning A plate of fried plantain, that's what we start with Deep on the side, we sit that real slow Me leaves smell nice, we pick what we grow, yeah Mountain sides, birds fly by Like blue skies, your deep red eyes This my kind of vibe, none the neighbor know We do my flow, so we know if we even bugs down now. And it's my favorite thing. Thinking up with you on a Saturday evening. Yeah, yeah. You know what?
