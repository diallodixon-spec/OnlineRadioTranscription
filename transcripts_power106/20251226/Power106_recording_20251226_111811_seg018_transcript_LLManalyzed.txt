20251226 111811 Every day as I live I try to think positive And every day I pray for someone good to you And in the end Love is sweet and so divine And I can't wait for my love light to shine, to shine Can anybody tell me where I can find Any love, any love that I hold love Everyone needs a love, no doubt And in love, in love Everybody feels alive
