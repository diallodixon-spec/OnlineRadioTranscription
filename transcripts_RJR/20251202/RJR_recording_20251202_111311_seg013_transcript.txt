============================================================

So it's back-to-back results. So we're doing very well. And against teams that are much more seasoned than we are. I'm so happy. Thank you so much, Jamaica. Yes? And the basketball players. Because you're showing what it means and what it can be done. It's not beyond us. You know, especially people, you know, giving our sides. And the impact we are having, yes? Basketball, bobsleigh, and you saw what happened with our field events during the World Championships. All right, you know, really, really happy. We need that. We need all this bit of good news, given the kind of gloom which is really, you know, on the island and understanding the so-called kind of death and destruction that we have to be dealing with. But we will highlight and continue to focus on some of the good things that's happening and our athletes are not failing us. Well, dare I say, and the regular girls as well doing very well against me.
