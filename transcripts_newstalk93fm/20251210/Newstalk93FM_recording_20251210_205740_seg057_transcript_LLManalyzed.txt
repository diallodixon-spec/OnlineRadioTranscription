============================================================

Oh, the sun's welcome, no, we won't run, just love me. Deep as the blue sea. Yeah, yeah, that you're deeper than the blue sea. I've seen many, but I still pick you just like a fruit tree. Look in my eyes, what do you see? I see happiness, me and you are kickin' like Bruce Lee. Baby girl, me want you pray this. One day without your lovin' and the rascal get seasick. Not even Viva when me sick can heal this. Lovin' when you give me complete this, I love me. Deep as the blue sea, deep as the blue sea. Love me really and truly. And even though the storms will come, no, we won't run. Just love me. Deep as the blue sea. Nice and easy, so deeply we submerge under this emotion. Like an anchor, you keep me safe. I'm not afraid of the ocean. I keep you warm and cozy, you make me calm.
