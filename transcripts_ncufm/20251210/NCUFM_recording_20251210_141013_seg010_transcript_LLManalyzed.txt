Good day to you, Rose from Kingston 8. You are actually the first person to send me a WhatsApp text message this afternoon. So sister Rose, good day to you. Welcome on board the driver. Special shout outs. And what about the first person with the WhatsApp voice notes? In the afternoons, we play this little game. We try to identify the first person sending us a WhatsApp text message and the first person sending me a WhatsApp voice note since two o'clock, two o'clock. So all those that came in before two, I assume those aren't for me. Let me see, voice note. Hi Michael, this is Edward on the drive, ready to go. I want to say shout out to Tamika, pleased to have a great day. Bye bye.
