20260102 144621 Shout out to Denton and the team right now. Shout out to Passage Fort, every member right now. Welcome out, the ball, go and kick it. All of the ballers, let me roll in and kick it. Every Sunday morning, Den-Tan and the family. Big it up, big it up, enough love, respect, all right? You know this Sunday where I roll out. What I mean? All-powerful omnipotent. Shine down your glory, your magnificence. When you feel the sense, it makes all the difference. Step in on me life and take precedence. Be the captain, the pilot, the teacher. Be the head and the boss.
