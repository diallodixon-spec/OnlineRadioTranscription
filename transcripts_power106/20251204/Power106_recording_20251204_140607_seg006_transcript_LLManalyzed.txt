============================================================

here we are once again at a time for remembering all of our good friends and to be with the family we don't see for the longest while just to share a smile And even though it might not have been the most beautiful year Still the little that I have Is enough to share But for all those hungry mouths That's been roaming all around Will someone in the name of love lend a healthy hand? Don't strain yourself, don't worry about it at all
