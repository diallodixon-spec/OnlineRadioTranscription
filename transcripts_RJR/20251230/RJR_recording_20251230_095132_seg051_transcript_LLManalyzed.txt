20251230 095132 is 10,000. And he says, when you compare that with the amount of death, you know, shooting from the police, is equivalent to 0.03. So what he wants to say, the total doesn't make much, because when you compare the amount of people with the police and the shooting, 0.03. Well, I don't know. I'm not sure if that is what he said, then it would beg the question, because as I was indicating for, interaction doesn't mean confrontation, unless he's saying, in terms of confrontations with the police... What I'm saying though, hold on, what I'm saying though and I do have the benefit of it, but based on what you're saying, you will not be comparing apples with apples. What I mean by that is, if you're going to say it's interactions as against confrontations, if you're gonna say fatal shootings, it of course suggests that there's a confrontation.
