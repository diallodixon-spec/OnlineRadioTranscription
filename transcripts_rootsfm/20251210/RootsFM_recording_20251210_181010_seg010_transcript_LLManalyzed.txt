I'm a Manticore being native, you know, went to Anchovy High School and, you know, a late reader. So, like, I start reading about the age of 14, but once I start reading, I start writing. You know, once I start reading I start writing. So, you know, I grew up with, like, animals, chicken, goats, cows and stuff like that. So you know, I was out one day with my bigger, one of my family relative, and he was saying, he heard me chanting some songs, he put in some lyrics together, and he said, yo, are you a lyricist that? And I said, no, no, man, I want a super cat, and Nico D must lyrics me that thing, you know? And I that thing. So he said, you know, you sound good. So I said, don't make people make up lyrics. He said, no man, you can write. He said you can write. So while he said that, he said you know, when we're carrying the goat, I'm going to demonstrate and show you.
