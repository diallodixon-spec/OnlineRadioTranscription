20260101 094522 Just white foam and pink like you and me, we'd be millions for a son of a boo. Each is given a bag of booze, a shapeless mask, and a stick of booze. Each must make their livers flowing, tumbling black or rustlet and stone. Just wind folding like you and me. With me, build us for eternity. Beaches in the back of trees. Shameless times, and a symbol to me. Pow, pow, pow, pow. Pow, pow pow pow. Pow. Pow pow pow pow, pow pow pow pow.
