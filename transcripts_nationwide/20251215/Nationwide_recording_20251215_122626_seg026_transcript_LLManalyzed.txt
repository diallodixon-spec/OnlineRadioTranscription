20251215 122626 St. Peter and Paul Preparatory schools successfully retained their Gise Kanopi National U-12 Football competition, Henrik's Knockout Cup title after edging Lannerman's Preparatory 5-4 run penalties in a tense final played over the weekend. The championship match ended in a scoreless draw after regulation time with both teams locked in a hard-fought by disciplined defending and missed chances at either end. With neither side able to break the deadlock, the final was decided by the dreaded penalty shootout. St Peter and Paul showed composure from the spot, converting five of their kicks, while Lannemans fell just short after missing one attempt, handing the defending champions a narrow victory and back-to-back titles. Earlier in the day, Hillel Academy secured third place in the competition after defeating Liberty Academy 5-3 on penalties. That match also finished Nilol at the end of regulation time before Hillel held their nerves in the shoot.
