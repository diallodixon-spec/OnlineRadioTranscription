20260101 193419 Anyhow Anyhow I'll keep singing All been good to me Through every test and trial I've got the victory The enemy has tried his best To make me turn around and bring me down But my God has never failed me yet So I'm gonna stand ground. No matter what comes my way, I'll lift my voices great. Hallelujah, Danny Haas. Wrapping it in one more time, think I'll say it again. God please go good to me.
