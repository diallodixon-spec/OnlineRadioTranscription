20251219 102521 keep you updated with the progress here but as I said that currently we are rolling out and we want to thank the Ministry of Agriculture, we want to thank Honourable Floyd Green and the team there, we want to thanks Wayne Hunter and his team at JAKRA and as I said all hands are on deck and we know that more is needed, We understand the issues in the West. We are not ungrateful. We want to make sure that whatever comes in goes directly to the farmers for the benefit of the coffee industry and rebuilding a resilient rural economy in Jamaica that will benefit the national economy on a whole. Thank you very much Norman. Bless up yourself. All the best for the season. That was Norman, Grand President of the Jamaica Coffee Exporters Association.
