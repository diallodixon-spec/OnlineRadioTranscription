20251229 185128 It was not an invitation But I flew home anyway With so much love to say It was not convenient, no But I whispered out the grave Should've kissed you anyway And it was not an invitation. Should've kissed you anyway. Should've kissed anyway. Anyway. And it was nice. My advice is always ruin the friendship. Better than regret it for all time. Should kissed you anyway And my advice is always answer the question Better than to ask it all your life Should've kissed anyway
