20251226 100605 Alright, so we're back. We're back. We'll just drive out. You understand? Go somewhere far. Come out of the community. I want to see them people every day. See if we can touch an art course. See if you can go to some different place and see some different people, different kind of food. You understand? Yesterday, my son, he was on the dinner. My Christmas dinner, normal yesterday. International plate. My plate. Two spoons of rice. Two spoons of pasta. Look, zebra meat. Hippopotamus.
