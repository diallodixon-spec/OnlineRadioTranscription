On the edge of your night, staying drunk on your vibe. The angels up in the clouds are jealous now that we've found something so out of ordinary. You got me kissing the ground, sanctuary, telling me what you've done. Oh Lord, return me to dust. The angels up in clouds are jealous knowing what we found. Something so heavenly, higher than ecstasy. Whenever you're next to me, oh mama Always in black and white Until I saw your light I thought you had to die to avoid Something so out of the ordinary
