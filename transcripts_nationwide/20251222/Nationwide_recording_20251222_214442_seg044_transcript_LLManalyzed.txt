20251222 214442 You're gonna get to where you let the feeling roll Get down to your rockin' soul So I'd like to know where you got the notion Said I like to know when you got the notion Rock the boat, don't rock the boat, baby Rock the boat, I don't tip the boat over Rock the boat, Don't rock the boat baby Rock the boat Ever since I was born you've led me in Your touch has thrilled me like the rush of a wind And your arms have held me safe from a rolling sea There's always been a quiet place to hardly leave Our love is like a ship on the ocean
