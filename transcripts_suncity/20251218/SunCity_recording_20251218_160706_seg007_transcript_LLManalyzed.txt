20251218 160706 I believe in you I swear that forever from today No one will ever take your place I believe in you And I believe our love will last always I never believed in fairy tales Though sometimes I wish I could I never believed that golden sabers Could ever find the perfect hood I never believed in magic All their wishes could come true But your very first kiss changed all my dreams
