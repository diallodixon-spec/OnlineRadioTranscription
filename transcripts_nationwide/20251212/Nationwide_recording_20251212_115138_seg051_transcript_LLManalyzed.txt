2025-12-12 12:14:07 use water bottles we wanted things that people in the community could use over and over again so that's why we're here okay and this is where the water commission comes in now because here in the business of water so i see those five gallon buckets yes yeah tell me your role in this okay so essentially we got the buckets from yellow and then we sanitize them sterilize them and then we fill them the water. And then we're assisting in terms of the distribution. So the distribution will be done with NWC, food for the poor, yellow. So in terms of distribution, so we're distributing about 100 of these filled kegs, which will be very useful because I never, I guess when you're not on the location, you don't realize the kind of need there is. Precisely. So I was somewhat concerned about whether or not persons would be willing to travel with these heavy buckets. But persons have expressed so far that if they need to carry it on their heads, their hands, any way they can carry it, they will be carrying it. So we'll be distributing today.
