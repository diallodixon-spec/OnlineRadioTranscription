20251222 140908 I'll shine and let it show. I remember feeling like I want to give up, but I never did. I held my head up like my mama did, because the struggle made me realize. Every time I face tears in my eye, I have to look up, find the strength to rise. Yeah. Seeing a brighter future. Believing that my life will be great. Keep on moving forward, no user. There's nothing that can kill my fate. As long I got hope I'll make it out of here I'll find the strength to grow I'll shine and let it go
