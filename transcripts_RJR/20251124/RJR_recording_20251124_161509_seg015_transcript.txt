Now I'm free, you come running after me, but you can't catch me again So I'm running for my life, at that heaven on my mind Move, see it and move, you can't get me again Me say I'm runnin' for my life At that heaven on ma mind I move, see it, and move You can catch me again Me say you can catch me again Come now man, can catch me again Fifteen minutes after four o'clock
