20260102 161916 Michael, I'm loving the songs. Anne-Marie said the songs are lifting her spirit. Check, check, check, my driver, M-I-T-J-L, Michael Forsythe. I want to send big up, I want to send birthday greetings to Amy Blake, who will be celebrating her birthday on the 6th of January. And I am on the bus. I am at the front seat of the bus. You said 6th of January, right? 6th of January and next week, Tuesday. Good day to you, sir. Paul from Portmore, how you doing? On the bus listening to the songs. Shout out to her sister, Tat in Bombay, Manchester, and also to the rest of the family. Nuff nuff blessing.
