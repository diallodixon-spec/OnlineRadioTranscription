20251231 202517 I've been hearing your heartbeat inside of me I keep getting photographed inside my bed Living in a world of fantasies I can't get you out of my head I've been waiting for the phone to ring all night Why you wanna make me feel so good? I've got a love of my own, babe I sure can get me so hung up on you I remember the way that we touched I wish I didn't like it so much. I get so emotional, baby, every time I think of you.
