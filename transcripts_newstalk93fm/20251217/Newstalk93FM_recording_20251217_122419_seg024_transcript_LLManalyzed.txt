20251217 122419 I know I can't get over it So don't you ever let me down again Cause I'm depending on you So you better come through this time Please hear my cry and if I ever let you down my friend It was a misunderstanding So if I took it for granted then And I promise from today I go drunk Like I never drunk Waved like I never waved Wired like I never won before Just to show you I'm sorry I'm sorry And I need you back in my life Look at people by the truck Emotions running high We are not in the sky Taste running down we high Can't you tell that we sorry We sorry And we need you back and we're high. We need you back, back, back. I need you, I need you. I need you. Come home to me, come home to me.
