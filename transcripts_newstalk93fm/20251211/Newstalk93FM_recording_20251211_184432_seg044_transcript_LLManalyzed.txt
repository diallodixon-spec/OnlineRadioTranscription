2025-12-12 12:43:27 I'm trying to destroy the other, holding on to feeling like harder. Try again. Bad might never prevail. All attempts never fail to try again. Bad mind never prevails. All them try never fail. Because pure hearts, we don't break. And we don't run away from. And we don't run away from, no weapon Once we have faith, we stand, no weapon Could cross by against way, no weapon But all the times that you hold them down Just take a look at them now You give them all but their hands still out Just take a look a them now They pull you back but can't slow you down Take a look at them know They see see you win and try to come back wrong. Just take a look at them, now. Fire, fire, fire. That's just before the water. We life is better than ever. Champagne somebody don't die. Champagne and shirley walker. Them are nothing so far. They try to destroy the other. Holy shit.
