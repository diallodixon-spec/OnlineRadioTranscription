National Ski and Snowboard Federation had initially barred them from competition, but the Court of Arbitration for Sport overturned that ruling last week, allowing the athletes to apply for individual neutral athlete status. The International Olympic Committee reviewed each application and approved the first group after they met strict eligibility requirements. While they are now free to participate in qualifying events, they cannot compete under their national flags or symbols. The decision follows months of appeals by the Russian Ski Association, the Belarusian Ski Union, and several athletes, with the tribunal partially upholding their case. More applications are expected to be processed in the coming weeks, meaning additional athletes could also be cleared to compete ahead of the games in Milan and Cortina, which begin on February 6 next year. And that concludes our sports report and our newscast at this time. On behalf of the News, Sports and Current Affairs Department, I'm Dawson Ho Sang. News next in the morning during First Light.
