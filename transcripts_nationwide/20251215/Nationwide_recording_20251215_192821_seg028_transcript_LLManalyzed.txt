20251215 192821 I remember. I will not forget. I remember every single solitary day people got up and asked, where is the crime plan? Where's the crime plan? When the five pillar document existed on the the website of the Ministry of National Security for everybody who wanted to read it. As far back as Robert Montague was minister, it was there. I remember the prime minister. And when, hold on, let me finish. Let me finish. Because I did my combo tonight. And when it was not enough, when they found the document, they said the document was not, quote, detailed enough. And I asked the question, show me the country. Show me the country with operational plans. Because point that was that's that's what they were asking for they wanted to know when the police was going to X how much guns they were going to have with them whether they were going to be wearing ballistic vest it got that silly and now nobody asked for a crime plan anymore
