20251215 133728 the Honorable Delroy Chuck speaking to, you know, increased investment in the infrastructure, but we do have a far way to go. And I just think it's important that we support that call. And in our 2026 advocacy Jade, I do believe as an organization, we have to do much more advocacy in terms of justice reform in these simple but practical means. Because there is no way we should have 13 years as the time period that a trial has not yet gotten underway. And we saw similar delays in the Mario Dean matter and it really is an injustice to have matters languishing before the courts due to lack of sufficient space and so on. So I think we need to do some more advocacy there.
