20251224 200204 Now, if your only exposure to Jubilee is a hospital downtown, you may be wondering how what at. The concept of the Jubilee, or liberation year, is one in which every 50 years or 7 sabbatical cycles, all debts were cancelled, ancestral lands were returned to families, agriculturally the land was wrested, and Hebrew slaves were given their freedom. Grounds for celebrating, don't it? Wouldn't you want every debt cancelled? This season, after Melissa, Jamaican farmers in the West are seeing their own version of a season of Jubilee. They're not getting cancellation exactly, but they are able to access a three-month moratorium on monies owed to the National Irrigation Commission, NIC. If you're a farmer in the West and you have outstanding balances up to October 31, NIC Director of Commercial Operations Wayne Barrett says you have up until January 31, 2026 to clear outstanding balances. The other thing we also implemented was the billing right off to give them further assistance financially.
