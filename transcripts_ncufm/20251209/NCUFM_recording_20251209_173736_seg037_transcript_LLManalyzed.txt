I think I am very aware. I mean compared to many other people I'm very careful with what I do online because I know it's stay with me for a long time. Okay, okay. Oh, so you're thinking about maybe like when time comes and you need a job like right first is it you know for you know all the while growing up I've never Concerned myself about that Maybe because men are really do nothing bad like that for lines to learn. That's not me, but I've never really concerned myself about that part of it. And then now you see a big thrust for companies who are saying, oh, they are tracking you to sell your ads.

I've seen it with a lot of people, especially with celebrities, especially in the whole Black Lives Matter movement.
