20251222 130705 I hear those sleigh bells ringing Sally won't you bring me the one I really need Please bring my baby to me I don't want a love for Christmas This is all I'm asking for I just want to see my baby Standing right outside my door I just want him for my own More than you could ever know Make my wish come true All I want for Christmas Is you It's live, 2Live, the 2Live crew on the Big 94. Keep it loud.
