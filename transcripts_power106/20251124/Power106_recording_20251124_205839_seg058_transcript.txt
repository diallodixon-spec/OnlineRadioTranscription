============================================================

I tried so hard to tell you, baby, in my heart that love is no more. But love here inside my lonely world, I feel so cold, yet reluctant to let you know What we had, has passed, and gone I just can't seem to understand this sudden change Girl, could we regain the laughter, loving and happiness That we shared before? Please don't tell me there is no more, no more
