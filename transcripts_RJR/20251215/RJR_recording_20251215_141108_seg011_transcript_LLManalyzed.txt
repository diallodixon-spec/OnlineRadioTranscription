20251215 141108 you are my christmas yes you are no frosty windows no sleighs on the street but your presents make the silence oh so sweet the snow might fall or it might stay away but you were my all year round christmas bouquet sorry santa i don't wanna waste your time with someone else, I've got mine. But everything I need right here with me. Merry Christmas, everyone, wherever you may be. I don't need a stocking or a fireplace. Because I have you to put a smile on my face. We have each other.
