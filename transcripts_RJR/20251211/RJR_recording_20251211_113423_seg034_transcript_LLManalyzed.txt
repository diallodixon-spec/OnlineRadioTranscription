is happening in that parliament and I'm gonna tell government members especially where opposition members are saying we were the chief architects of particular laws that have been passed by this parliament you need to listen more to them and look at the law that they're talking about I watched a couple weeks ago Mark Golding take to pieces the order that came to suspend the fiscal rules because it was drafted with an incorrect year and he had to point out that he was the chief architect and the year that we had in the order would have deprived us of at least one or could be two years in terms of our debt payment exercise with all the loans that we're taking on. And we appreciate it and welcome that Mrs. Jesus. And it has to continue.
