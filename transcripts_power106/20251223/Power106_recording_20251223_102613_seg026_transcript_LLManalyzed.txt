20251223 102613 So when I went up here three weeks ago, they run and they look at the computer and they say yes, but that RADA ID expired. So I have to talk to about the process. I didn't know I have to talk about the process. It cost me $500, so whether I have it, yes or no. I said to them, I can't really deal with that now. So the lady said to me, I am from Springfield Pierport and all of them, so whenever anything comes, they will get to me. I don't know if the fertilizer is through RADA, or from Senator Grant, through the Mavis Bank, or the Coffee Growers Association. So I don't fool it. but I don't call him Lentless, right? But one of the key persons, he's a part of the Coffee Grower Association and I am a member of it still, which I intend not to pay no more money until I see the thing working for the farmers.
