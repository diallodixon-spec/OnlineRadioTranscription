2025-12-12 08:36:01 To be fine Today, you're not here. I'm so lonely. It's the waiting that's driving me out of my mind Don't know how I'll sing in that big city How can I perform if you're not there? This will be the worst of all my journeys. The image of your face will follow me everywhere. I need your tender kisses, the feel of your hands you caressress Your perfume has me burning My heart's yearning to touch you I miss you so much If you're not here by my side
