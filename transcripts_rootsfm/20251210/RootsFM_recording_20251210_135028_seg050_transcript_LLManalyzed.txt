============================================================

The way you smile, the way you retire, the way you take care of yourself. In every way you make my day, you know I want you so bad. I see it in your eyes that it's me. It's only me who can love you so, baby baby Hot like a fire My heart desires You're pretty like a fire A brown skin Girl I wanna wrap love in every direction in my song.
