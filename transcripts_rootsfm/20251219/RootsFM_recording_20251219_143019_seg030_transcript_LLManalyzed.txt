20251219 143019 But let me tell you, pregnancy is something I call for all different things. Clothes, Pampers, Crepes. How you read so far already. I don't hear you talk about clinic check-ups, iron, folic acid pill, healthy food and them something there. Well, all of that for my mother and father we are never going to clinic and she eat what she feed for and we did alright. Your pregnancy and your mother own are two different something. You are climbing up in age now so you are high risk for sugar, high blood pressure and other things that can affect you and your baby even before the time for the clothes, pumpers and cream. You try your best, go to clinic early and go get your checkup. You hear me Diana? Once a baby business, clinic is a must and a healthy body is a must. Healthy baby, healthy you. It's easy to learn what to do. A message from the Ministry of Health and Wellness.
