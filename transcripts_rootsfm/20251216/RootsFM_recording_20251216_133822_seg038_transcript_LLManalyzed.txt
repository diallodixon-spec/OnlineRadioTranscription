You could stay with me tonight Good if that's what you were like and take a real woman make a home feel warm inside promise I won't bite unless you got a sister, I go Shelly I thought of you, keep my mouth watering in Ridova Got me feeling for a slice of that apple pie You the apple in my eye, wanna drop my Johnny Appleseed And you wanna grow an apple tree, so we can live happily You like soul food to me, these other girls is Applebee
