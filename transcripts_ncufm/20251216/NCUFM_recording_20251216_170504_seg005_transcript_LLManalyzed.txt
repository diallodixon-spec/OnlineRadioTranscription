20251216 170504 Mr Darvaz says the bill increase approved by the OUR underscores several issues the government has with the existing JPS oil island license. He says it's for this reason the government has decided to loan the electricity company 150 million US dollars to fund their post-hurricane restoration efforts instead of extending the license. The bottom line is that the current JPS license cannot continue in its current form. For this reason, as Energy Minister, I could not entertain the extension of the existing license and the existing terms for another 10 to 15 years. The current license does not protect the consumer and the independent regulator can do very little to intervene. Though this increase is significantly less than the amounts announced post-burial, which was as high as a better license must be the way forward.
