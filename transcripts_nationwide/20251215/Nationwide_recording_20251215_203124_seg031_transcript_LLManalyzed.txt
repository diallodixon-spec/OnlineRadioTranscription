20251215 203124 I wasn't into cars, no inner petty wars I knew I was a winner who was destined for Mars But it suck cause I have all these emotional scars Everybody thought I would end up behind bars Now, a lot of y'all thought I wouldn't make it A lot of you're not real, I'm just a fake it But I don't care if you are whatever dude I'm busy tryna get this food them can't shake me fit Cause I know within myself that I was born to be great But sometimes they burden me every year and I can't take the weight short Enough time to mess up my life
