20251224 102009 I really push through big ups to everybody who have that keeps Sun City running every single day. Thank you so much, you know, for giving of yourself, for showing up when you need to for giving that extra hour, for giving that extra time. It's because of the team why we're able to survive and stand the way we are. I want to just big up everybody who keeps the train running. Big ups to everybody. I wish you all the best. May you have a wonderful, amazing Christmas, you know, day and we get for chill a little bit. Big up to the Sun Jacks who will be playing tomorrow so that we can get a little time off. Big up on yourself. Thank you so much. I know it's a sacrifice and it does not go unnoticed. I appreciate every single thing that you, the Sun Jacks do. Big up on yourself. Thank you so much for keeping the airwaves alive every single day. You know, it is not. And big ups to our hosts. Big up to the hosts.
