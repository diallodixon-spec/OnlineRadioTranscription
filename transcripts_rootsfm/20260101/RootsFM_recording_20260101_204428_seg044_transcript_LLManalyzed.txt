20260101 204428 Remember those walls I built Oh baby, they're tumbling down And they didn't even put up a fight They didn't even make the sound I found a way to let you in But I never really had a doubt Standing in the light of your halo I got my angel now It's like I've been awakened. Every rule I had you breaking. It's the risk that I'm taking. I ain't never gonna shut you out.
