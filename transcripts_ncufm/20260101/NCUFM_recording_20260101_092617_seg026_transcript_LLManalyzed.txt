20260101 092617 I owe you my love, I can't break. Somebody declare, even if I had 10,000 turns, it wouldn't work because you've been so good. You have been so good. Somebody raise up your voice tonight. Now listen, we're getting ready to testify of the goodness of our Savior. You've been better than good to me
