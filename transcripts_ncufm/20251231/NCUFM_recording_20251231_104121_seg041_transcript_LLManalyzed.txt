20251231 104121 Oh, welcome to Healthy Alternatives where we share quick, easy, healthy and delicious plant-based recipes. Today is our final holiday edition of Healthy Alternatives with the one and only Eden's Valley. Now, tell me cruisers, wasn't it fun and exciting to see the food that we were talking about being made? If you didn't get a chance to see the last videos, don't worry, you will be able to see today's video and all the rest on NCUFM's and Eden Valley's Instagram page, which is at NCU91FM for our page and at Eden's Valley Food JA for Eden's Valley. Now, joining me today is Mr. Alton Scott, the managingaging Director. Good morning, Mr. Scott. How are you doing? Good morning. I'm doing great, and you? Wonderful. I'm not too bad myself, and I'm doing wonderful this morning. Now, tell us, what will we be making today? Well, today...
