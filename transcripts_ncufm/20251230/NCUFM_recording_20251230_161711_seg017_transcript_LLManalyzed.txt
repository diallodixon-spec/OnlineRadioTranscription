20251230 161711 I got a home on the other side Why don't you swing down Cherry Star and let me ride? Swing down Cherry Star, and let me ride Rock me Lord, rock me Lord, come and easy I got a home, on the other side Now there were two white horses standing side by side This old chair is gonna let me ride And one of these mornings, bright and early I'm going home to the other side Why doning down, cherry-stopping, let me ride. Rock me, Lord, rock me, Lord. Calm and easy, I got a home on my side.
