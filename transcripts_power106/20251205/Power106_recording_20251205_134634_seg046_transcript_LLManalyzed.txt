We don't keep enough of the foreign dollar for us to grow the economy out of tourism. The components that make up the tourism industry, we don't own it. We don't own those hotels. If I were to book, and I never will go to an all-inclusive hotel. Never. You won't catch me there dead. When you book a week at one of those all-inclusives, when you pay with your credit card, that money don't touch a Jamaican bank. And most of those hotels are owned by foreigners. Most of what happens in tourism is extractionary. I agree with you and yet it still is responsible. The suppliers that make the hotel function.
