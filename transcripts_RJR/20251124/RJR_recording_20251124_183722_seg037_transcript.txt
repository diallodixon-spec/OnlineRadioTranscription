when the population is at a very low number, that's the time when you need to act. After that, there is no return. Well, one of the first things Damian did along with me is to send it on to Nepal. So Damani, let me bring you in here. What happened then? Well, we were also put in contact with Sir Johnson who sent you the video and we asked for him and the person in the community to keep an eye out and inform us because we don't have the personnel to be everywhere all at once but it's a public effort to have eyes on the ground and basically report if they sight. Luckily the residents not only sight but they captured it and then Nepal was able to get it because they actually took it to the police station. Wow. Alive?
