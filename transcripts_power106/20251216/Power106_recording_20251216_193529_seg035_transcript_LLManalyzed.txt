20251216 193529 and having competitions. And we are grateful for that. And that is what also gave us the strength and the initiative to push on through with the national tournament that we are scheduled to host this Sunday, December 21st at the Port Rhodes Club in Discovery Bay Center. After our original location for the tournament was actually in St. Elizabeth. That's the port of Carlotel. But as you would understand, it was badly damaged in the recent passage of Hurricane Melissa. So we're encouraged by the continued excitement, the continued play of our players across the island and within those areas that were affected. So this tournament is strengthened by the resilience of the draft community. Well said, absolutely well said.
