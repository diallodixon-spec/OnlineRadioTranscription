Two months of conversation, man. This is a magic. Spit the game under cover. I'm lethal like Danny Glover. Got you running to your mother, making plans for life. Yo, I'm only 15. What I need with a wife? We can walk through the mall while I hold your hips, so you can hang out the drop while I'm pushing the whip. Take you on a ride, you will never forget. Go on your home, tell your friends, Lil' Fizz is it. Got you knowin' by the way that I lick my lips. Man, I got many guns, honey, sweatin' your chick.
