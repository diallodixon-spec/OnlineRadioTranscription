20251230 110906 sweet deliverance I will rest by and by one of these days my life is over sorrow will disappear I'm gonna walk all around all around the streets of gold I'm gonna lose him and decrease him in glory Sing a happy song and tell the glad story Walk all around, walk all around the streets of gold One of these days when life is cold, sorrow will disappear Walk all around, talk all around the streets of hope. I'm gonna meet the city and greet him in his glow. Sing a happy song and tell the glad story. Walk all around talk all around the street of hope.
