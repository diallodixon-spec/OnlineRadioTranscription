20251229 171313 I tell it to you I love whenever you bring a vine With your hands them up in the sky Watch we drunk and having a time Carnival time again And we have all money to spend And we go right down to the end Watch me with me cannibal friend Then, then me cannibal friend, friend, friend Now me cannibal friend friend, friend friend Make cann yeah. Now, we're carnival friends. Until we meet up again. Ah! We meet, meet, meet. Meet, rumble. Meet, meet. Meet. Meet. Things so sweet, sweet, sweet. Feel complete. Cause we love you back and now. Meet, meet, rumble.
