20251230 111209 This is a fight. Our love is like summer snow. You are hot like summer. Warm my heart. I don't need no other. I love spending time with you like the sunlight. You see me through. It's a holiday when we love this like summer time. Fireflies lighting our way as we walk, words floating in the air.
