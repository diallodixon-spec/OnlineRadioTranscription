20251215 160101 You're listening to Sleek Radio, 93 FM. I feel your frequency from miles away You come alive with one wine baby With you I want to dance the night away One jam turn a lifetime baby So don't feel away You don't like the fast life The look look on the bright side. I go take the blame. I just want you to come and light it up. Just a little winding up. Come and meet me in the truck and we rev it up. All day, keep throwing it back up.
