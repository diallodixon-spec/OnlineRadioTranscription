20260101 110001 And look what we've become We can make a million promises, but we still wanna change It isn't right to stay together when you only bring each other pain I don't wanna to cry Don't want to cry Nothing in the world could take us back To where we used to be I'm giving you my heart and soul I'm giving you My heart and soul I must find a way to let it go Cause baby, I don't want to cry I don't wanna cry
