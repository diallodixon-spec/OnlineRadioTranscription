20260102 090507 But just a few thoughts I wanted to share with you and the first of course good news in terms of what can now be clearly defined as a dramatic decline in the number of murders. Murders fell by 42% when compared to last year. 660 odd murders as at the ending of last year. And this is the lowest murder rate which we have had as a country in 32 years. Can you imagine that? It is significant. It is good news. It is cause for celebration. Obviously the JCF and other members of the security forces are in for commendation.
