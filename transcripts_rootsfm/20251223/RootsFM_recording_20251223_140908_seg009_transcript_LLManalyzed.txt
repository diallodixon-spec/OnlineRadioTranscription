20251223 140908 Baby, baby, baby, baby. I get so high when I'm around you, baby. I can touch the sky. You make my temperature rise. Oh, baby. You're making me high. Baby, baby, baby, baby. Lending my money, you don't think about my day upset. That very thought of you makes me want to get undressed. I want to be with you in spite of what my heart says. I guess I won't feel too bad. All I want is you.
