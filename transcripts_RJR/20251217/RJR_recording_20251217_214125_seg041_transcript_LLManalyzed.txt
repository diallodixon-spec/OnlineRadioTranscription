20251217 214125 I'm waiting for the right time to shoot my steel. You know, waiting for the right to flash them keys. And I'm leaving. Please believe in me and the rest of my heathens. Checking out a lock at the top of the Four Seasons. Penthouse, rooftop, birds are feeding. No deceiving, nothing up for sleeping. No teasing. I need you to get up up on the dance floor. Get that man what he asking for? Cause I feel like busting loose. And I feel like touching you. And can't nobody stop the juice. So baby, tell me, what's the use? I said, it's getting hot in here. So take off all your clothes. I am getting so hot. I will take my clothes off. It's getting hot. It's getting so hot, I want to take my clothes off. Oh, it's getting hot in here, so take off all your clothes. Oh, I am getting so high, I want to get my clothes off. Why you at the bar if you ain't popping the bottles? Come on, kill it. It's all the fame if you ain't fooling the models. I see you driving sports cars, ain't hitting the throttle. And I be down, I do a honey top down and goggles. Get off the freeway.
