When somebody calls and you identify the person that's Metro or St. Pete or Mary or whatever the case might be, some of the times when the text messages, you must call out their name because you just read text messages and I remember, like this morning, right? Metro called and I was talking and said something about him know the size of the army and a man called, right? Metro mentioned know the size of the army, and a man called, right? I said, make a mention about the size of the Army. He dropped off, I'm sure, because I was laughing, right? No, I can't say I know this size of the Army, because when I was there, right, we have a Chief of Staff, we call him Brigadier, we have Dunstan Robinson, we have Parkwood, that was the first one after Independence, and we have David Simit, right? And then you have a full Colonel named Mascall, and then you have a Lieutenant Colonel who controls the military, that's Dunstan Robinson, right?
