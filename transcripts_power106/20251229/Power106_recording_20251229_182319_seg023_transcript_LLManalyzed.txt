20251229 182319 a long way to go because this group of under-16 players only started playing together, as I said, early September. We had a little two-day recruitment, Ms. Nadia Adams-Richards, our treasurer, and we had that recruitment over a two-day period, and they turned out, and I'm really proud to see where they are right now. The challenge is to have them continue to play together so that we can play matches or compete, do more competitions together so that we will have a better shot of doing well if we are able to go to the GNPR tournament early April next year. Okay, Cayman is coming around 37th in the world and there's talk, when I see this template that you have there, or this plan, in top 20, is the goal? Is there a timeline for that?
