2025-12-12 12:53:35 I can't explain this feeling Night and morning, sometimes I can explain this feeling I tell them every single time. I want to spread my life living in this kind of way. Feel that kind of way, yeah, feel a kind of way. Huh, huh, we go! Sometimes I can't explain this feeling. Night and morning, sometimes I can explain this feeling. It's always jumping, sometimes I can't explain the feeling. Night and mornin', sometimes I can explain the feeling. Hey, hey, so let me go with you.
