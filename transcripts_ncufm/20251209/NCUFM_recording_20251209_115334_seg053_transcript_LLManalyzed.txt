and blessings towards us as your children. Lord, as we come to you today, again we lift up our voices in presenting your people here on the island of Jamaica who have been displaced, who have been broken, who are grieving God because they have lost loved ones. So many are without a roof over their heads. So many have no beds to lay on when night falls. But we are reminded, God, that the earth is still yours and the fullness thereof the world and us that dwells therein and so I ask in a special way today that you will remember your people for those who are calling upon your name God and are seeking your face you have promised
