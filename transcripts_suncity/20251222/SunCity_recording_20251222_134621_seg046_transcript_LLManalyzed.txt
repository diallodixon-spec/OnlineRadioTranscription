20251222 134621 I'm a hustler, baby I just want you to know It ain't where I've been But where I'm about to go I just wanna love ya But be who I am And with all this cash You'll forget your man In the Ferrari, a Jaguar, switchin' for labor Top down, streamin' out money in the bank Bubble hard in a double law, flashin' the frames With the window cracked, Hollaback, money in the bank Jigga, I don't like it if it don't gleam Gleamin' the hell with the price
