============================================================

I've got the candles glowing in the dark I'm hanging all the stockings by the Christmas tree Oh, why? Cause that's Christmas to me Oh, why? cause that's Christmast to me I listen for the third of reindeer Walking on the roof As I fall asleep to the lullabies The morning's coming soon The only gift I'll ever need Is the joy of family, oh, why? Because that's Christmast to me I've got this Christmas song in my heart I've got the candles glowing in the dark
