Tracey? Hey, girl, what's up? So hold on. Why you look so vexed this early? The energy just stopped. Lisa, it is so good to see you. But sorry you catch me like this, girl. My uncle said when I'm bailing, when my family go for clarity, you don't want to hear the price the people then put on the something. Make matters worse, me hear say half of the things are missing and I don't see any customs. Girl, how do you not see any customs? At least stop going like you don't have any sense. You don't see everybody talking about it in the media. You don't want me to stop listening to you. Have you ever experienced that? Customs don't go in your package, suitcase, barrel or cargo unless you ship the item or the agent stand up right there when they might inspect it. Listen, customs job is to protect the borders, collect revenue and to facilitate trade. Them not collect or store shipment, them inspect it and somebody off-represent it for inspection.
