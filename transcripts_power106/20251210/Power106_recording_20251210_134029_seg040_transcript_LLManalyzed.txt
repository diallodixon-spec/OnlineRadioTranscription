MP does that, and the MP does that in order to endear himself to his constituents and those who didn't vote for him or her last time. So I agree with you that that is part of the reason, Beresford. It doesn't, however, take away from the point I was making about the role that they do play. For instance, I was talking to one who said if you don't go to the Nainai and the grave digging and the funeral and whatnot, you are frowned upon as the MP. Well, me not even go funeral for me mother much less, so I could never do that job in order to cater. But maybe that is important in the absence of real governance in the constituency. I did the MP network and bring more jobs to his constituents, more business, more factories.
