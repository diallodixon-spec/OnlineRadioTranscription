2025-12-11 21:32:37 To serve and protect you Police are everywhere, it's like you're shining armor Come to your rescue at the sound of your alarms Blue and white flashing lights I ring Patrol the streets while everyone's asleep So if you're serving, be proud to be a member Show off your badge, show off your regulation number Your oath of office is a promise to the people So why should I be scared when the police approach my Vika? As I raise my right hand, and I take this oath to serve and protect. To serve and protect, yeah. In peace, in war, the police reassure to serve and protect, to serve and protect ya. Respect the members of our security forces from the K-19
