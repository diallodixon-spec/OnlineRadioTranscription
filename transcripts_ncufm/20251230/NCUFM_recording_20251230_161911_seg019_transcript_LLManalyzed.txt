Can you believe persons are just getting back internet, electricity and all of them things? Right before going off, I had a message from one of the members of the Drive Time family saying that them electricity just come back. Parts of Black River just get back light. That was Christmas Day. Good evening, Michael. Thank you, thank God my electricity is back. No internet has yet but I'm grateful. I did not hear you on air but I know you were on vacation. I know you enjoy your vacation. Oh you know that, oh you know that. Oh you know what's going on. greeting Stee and your lovely wife. Welcome back as we all enjoy the journey together. Sister Price, good day to you. Welcome on board the Sistling Manderson aka Vaddney. Happy, happy birthday on this year's special day.
