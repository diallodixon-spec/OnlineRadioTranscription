2025-12-11 19:37:43 Good afternoon, Independence City. Hey, good afternoon to the crew right here in Kingston. It's been a while I haven't heard anyone out of Craig Town. I'm not feeling good. Guess what will be happening tomorrow along Arbor Street. 13 to 19 Arbor Street will be blazing. Courtesy of Spectrum. Roost Radio will be broadcasting live. We're gonna be kicking off things early in the morning from 8 up until 4 p. It's going to be awesome. So I want for you to be a part of that reality. Good afternoon to the crew. Spectrum Massive, 13 to 19 Arbor Street.
