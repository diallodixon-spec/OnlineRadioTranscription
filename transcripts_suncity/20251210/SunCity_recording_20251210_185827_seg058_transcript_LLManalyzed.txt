============================================================

Rise me up this morning. Give thanks to see the rising sun. And even when it's dawning, give thanks to see the day is done. Cause the time is so perilous, mankind is so dangerous, in this time you don't know who to trust, no. But it's so easy, to give thanks and praise, to chat every day. Oh, yes. It's so easy. Give thanks and praise. Jah, every day, oh, Lord. Oh, Lord.
