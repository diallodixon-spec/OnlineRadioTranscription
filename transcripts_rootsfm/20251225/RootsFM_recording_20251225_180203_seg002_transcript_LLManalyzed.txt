20251225 180203 We wish you a eerie Christmas We wish you a happy eerie Christmas And a happy, happy, happy block pocket day Christmas I don't know what that means, love. Love in Africa, love in Jamaica. But I knew to really tell you when your name is Baker, I'm for sake, y'all. I ain't say Jah, Jah, me, I'm y'all. Oh, no, so we speak, and make me rock it on top. But I tell you about the summer, baby, nigga, we all be cool. I don't want to, what you do, we all say, yeah, you don't.
