20251231 103217 Good morning to our listeners. Welcome to Quality Health Inside Wellness Wednesdays here on Route 96.1 FM. I am yours truly Adira Truth. Substituting for ISIS this morning, we are joined by Dr. Steven Longmore, General Practitioner, as we focus on a topic that affects many families, especially this time of the year, managing asthma. Dr. Longmore, good morning. Hey, good morning. Thank you for joining us. To start us off, Doc, for listeners who may not fully understand the condition, what is asthma? That's a good question. Asthma is essentially a chronic disease of your airways and it typically affects your lungs and we typically diagnose asthma in childhood.
