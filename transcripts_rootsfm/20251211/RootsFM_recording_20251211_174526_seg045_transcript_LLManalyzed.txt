2025-12-12 02:23:43 Today is the day We'll both be walking away Cause love is gone And we have no reason to stay No, we won't look back On the happy times We'll just both look away To lose the night So hold your head up high Oh, and try not to feel bad. Because we gave it our all and all. We gave it all we had. Oh, baby. Baby. Goodbye, my love.
