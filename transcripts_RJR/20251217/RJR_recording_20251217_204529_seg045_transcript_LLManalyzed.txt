20251217 204529 I really care what people say I really watch what them watch Just got paid and I got a little money to burn I gotta get a slave, gotta find me a sexy girl So listen, hey pretty baby, wanna ask you your name I like the way you groove, I hope you're feeling the same Got me attracted to the shape of your frame Let me introduce you to my group or my fame No, don't get it twisted I'm just being plain Wanna stain your mind with lyrics and get in your veins If you got the tunnel here comes the train Baby let me know if you're down to my game Cause I just got paid and I got a little money to burn. I gotta get laid, gotta find me a sexy girl.
