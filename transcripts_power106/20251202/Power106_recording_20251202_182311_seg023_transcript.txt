you know, heading forward, considering, you know, 40% of goals are scored on set plays. You know, the club I support Arsenal are deemed set-piece FC because they seem to always end up doing those games off of set plays. But the reality is in the modern game, it's very, very important. And I think, you know, having analysed it the last 48, 72 hours, I think you know, we could have probably been a little bit better in front of goal on set plays as well. So yeah, look, we're nitpicking, but that's what we do, as you said, as we as coaches tend to do. And yeah, we're going to take that away and continue to improve on that aspect of our play. Set pieces are very, very important because it's an opportunity. And so I'm very impressed that you are one of those coaches who think that it's of that importance.
