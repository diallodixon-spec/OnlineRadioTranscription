20251219 124029 It's been a long time since I've been in a car. It's been a while since Saturday night and the rest of your life. Anyone with a heart would agree. It's so easy to fall in love when the way I do my hair, the way I make you laugh, the way we like to share a walk in Central Park. I could be fresh air, might be the girl of your dreams There's no need to hide if you're into me Cause I'm into you quite intimately And maybe one night could turn into three Well, I'm down to see cause I make it so easy
