20260102 165642 This question and Natalie we may have to carry some of these questions over to Monday, but this one says Which guest brought the most vibes in 2025? I'm going to go ahead and say Luciano. I absolutely love Luciano's interview It stands out to me every single time when I remember that the energy and you just it's just beautiful because it was unexpected the man is such a storyteller That's a great one. He was very interactive, you can feel that he respected us, which is very important as a legend of his stature. You can tell that he really respected us as interviewers and he even said it that this was one of his best interviews that he's ever done. And that too I think is one of the best interviews that he has ever done.
