20251225 180002 We come to the end of the city. Why the music bling? And the hiking stanky? This is dream dancing. You didn't see a man. A dance with me woman. Me no make a the rules Me and you make no foes No matter what the party dance, dance, dance We come together, we skip the air We come together, and we skip the air Entertainment It's a form of empowerment No We come to enjoy, we seek the earth. Please Mr. DJ, nobody feel the wind. Not for the music plays. In a different style, in a robot of style No matter what you call it dance, dance, dance, we come for you
