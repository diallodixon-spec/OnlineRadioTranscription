20251219 200806 When you pray, when you pray There should be a fire in your heart And the rain, when you pray Consume it, consume it Every part becomes you know The God is heard, the God is heard Make His presence known When you raise, praise will bind Confuse and break the enemy And call his hands to be still. So we charade our hand and jolt of victory.
