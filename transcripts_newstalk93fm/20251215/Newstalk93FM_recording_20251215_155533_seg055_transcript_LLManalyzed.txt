20251215 155533 Just love me Deep as the blue sea, deep as the blue sea Love me really and truly And even though the storms will come, no we won't run Just love me, deep as blue sea Nice and easy, so deeply we submerge under this emotion Like an anchor, you keep me safe, I'm not afraid of the ocean I keep you warm and cosy you be coming on me arms when the storms approaching so why funny when all of us think like the titanic the lighthouse we are where I fall in Deep as the blue sea your love's flowing into me and even though the waves are rough this love is tough just love me Deep as blue sea, deep as the blue sea Love me really and truly And even if the storms will come, no we won't run Just love me, deep as a blue sea Wherever the wind may carry us
