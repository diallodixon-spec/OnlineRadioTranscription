Speak about the Minister of Parliament. It speak about the member of Parliament. It don't speak about the minister of Parliament So the minister should not have more rights Because it speak about the constitution speak about member of Parliament not ministers of Parliament depends on what you're talking about Depends on what you talking about Because the minister has more rights in the Jamaican outdated standing order and parliamentary practice system in Jamaica and I am saying listening it analyzing it watching it and observe it and come to my conclusion it is outdated and the speaker must not have more latitude rights than no member of parliament when When you go to court in Jamaica, the prosecution do not have more rights in the courts.
