20260102 131211 You're at the top of my list cause I'm always thinking of you I still remember in the days when I was scared to touch you How I spent my day dreaming, planning how to say I love you You must have known that I had feelings deep enough to swim in That's when you opened up your heart and you told me to come and hold my love A thousand kisses from you is never too much I just don't wanna stop, oh my love A million days in your arms is never too much. I just don't want to stop. Never too much, never too much. Never too much.
