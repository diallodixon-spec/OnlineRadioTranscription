20260102 160707 It's like we're making love for lost time You just spell it out for me Passing over all night It's like a bag of alcohol for me Introduce me to your best friend Satellite ain't even that far I kinda wonder where you are anymore I can't leave it alone, you're on my mind Already gave you the time and the place Don't be shy, just come be the man I need Tell me you got something to give, I want it I don't like it when you call me for the fall Whatever the type of talk it is, go on then I gotta know you're meant to be the man
