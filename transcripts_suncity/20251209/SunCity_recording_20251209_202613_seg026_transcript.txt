============================================================

The sun will shine, the pain will fade We'll rise again unafraid We see the youth and every elder's neighbors come together Love gets stronger, no light, but still we see If no food or water, we have plenty of food We're proud of the island fight Spirit of the people, still alive We rebuilt with hearts and pride One love one step side-by-side From the hills to the sea, let love be the key. Together we're strong, one family. Sweet, sweet Jamaica. The sun will shine, the pain will fade.
