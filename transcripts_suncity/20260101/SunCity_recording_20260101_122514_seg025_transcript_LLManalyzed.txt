20260101 122514 I belong to you with every breath I take. Write your name across my heart. And all my thoughts and all I do and all I say, I belong to you. With every breath I take Write your name Across my heart I want the world to know that I am yours forever And I'll wear it like a shining star Write your name across my heart
