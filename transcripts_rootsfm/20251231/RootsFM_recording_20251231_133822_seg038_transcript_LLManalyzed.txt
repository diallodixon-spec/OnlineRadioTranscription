20251231 133822 Cross me in the evening Need your sweetness twice a day And then when the night comes You know it's time for more Fire and desire When we're lost behind the door You're magic, you're like music You put the words into my song, yeah You're magic you're like music Now I know know that we belong You can't stay away from me. We've got the love that glows and glows. You're the one for me, yeah. Whoa, yeah. Oh, yeah.
