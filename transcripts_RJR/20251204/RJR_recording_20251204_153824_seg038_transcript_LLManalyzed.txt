not every artist has that kind of diversity. I think every artist can do it, but many artists, like we just said before, scared to step off of the beaten path because, you know, you may not think, well, what may I say? You may not think we don't understand. We don't understand how the audience can be savage. Yes. And many artists don't want to take the chance so they might offend, you know, people, especially in this era. You're not going to get no diversity ever again. And the audience are complaining about it, but it's not their fault because they're not sensitive. Everyone is so tender. They want to tenderize. I don't know who in the back of them beat them with a little tenderizer. It will be. But if you cough, it will offend them. If you grow a strand of hair, it'll offend them. But if you hit barley, you'll offend them too. It's like there is no pleasing them. So you're not going to get diversity anymore, even less diversity. If a man does a bad man song and finds a working mother, sing bad man song and you're going to be stuck in that monotone for the rest of your career. Because we have shrunk.
