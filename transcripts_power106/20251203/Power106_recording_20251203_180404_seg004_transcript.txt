Christmas carols over many, many years. And we gave you that version to start us off. Yesterday, we gave you Kenny Rogers' version in the country and Western music soiree. And today, you're going to be hearing from that outstanding multilingual French-Canadian singer, one of the greatest performers we've ever seen. And she did grace us with her presence here in Jamaica about 20 or so years ago. And of course, once I say French Canadian, you know we are talking about Celine Dionne. Sit back, relax, and savor, in all respects, her version, interpretation of O Holy Night.
