Stop this foolish about this GLP and PNP business. We are a Jamaican. It's not a matter of a GLP or a PNP. I think it's more like where it is that you think you're comfortable, what support you can offer to make the country better.

Tune into Nationwide at 6.25pm for Public Opinion, where the people's views matter. Public Opinion is brought to you by Cleasing Industrial Supplies Limited, Industrial Automation and Control Solutions.
