20251229 175230 in terms of where we plan to go for what we have planned to achieve then, yeah. All right, couple of questions now. One, is the high command concerned about the increase in the number of police killings in 2025? The latest number I'm seeing using the Indicom tracker is 310 to date. Well, the answer, the simple answer to that is yes, because any number of police fatal shootings that you're going to register is going to be a cause for concern. We maintain that we are encouraging persons to not engage the members of the constabulary with lethal force. We maintain that persons should practice safe surrender. We are going to increase our operational work. We're going to increase our investigative and intelligence work.
