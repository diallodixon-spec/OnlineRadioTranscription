When you play but you still no one give thanks You still complaining, you just complaining Your part stirring up but it's never enough You no one give thanks, you still complaining You still complaining And when they ask you how you doing Your reply is not too bad I tell you delhi is in the place so i'm gonna have people have a catch-up because i can't respect delhi to reach here and we need to get a proper catch- as to where to go on. So daily were you here for me to listen? Were you here for the hurricane? No, no, no, no. You see it? I was telling people I wasn't getting the catch up. So daily you were watching us. I was. Were you worrying for us? Definitely. Were you? Yes I was. So tell me what was the energy like?
