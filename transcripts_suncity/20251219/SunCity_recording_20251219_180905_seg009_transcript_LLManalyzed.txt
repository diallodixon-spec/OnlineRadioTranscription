20251219 180905 I wanna fly Just in the sky I wanna fly Now I'd like to make it jump, jump, jump Now I'll let you make it something gonna jump back come at your knees, baby Shake it to the max. Did you please turn up the pace to the max? Please just rewind, let me shake it to the max. Young at the fear, number one in command. I came just to kill me in two militants. They won't figure it out, but I don't need a man. Started love, had me wine, and me true religion. You dealing with the body, of course. Or you dealing with the boss. If we break up, then you know that it's a loss. Upgraded every day.
