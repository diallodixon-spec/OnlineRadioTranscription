20251217 202013 Come down, Father. Come down. I beg you, come down. Father, come down. In my my heart I know that you won't let your chosen people suffer. Too long. I know you'll never let us down. No, no, no, no. Many times I could have picked up a gun. I could have go out the street and played it down. That's no fun, no. Sure ain't no fun, no fun at all. Cause I think what would happen if the other man thinks the same, then bullets fall like rain. It's no fun no. No, it's no fun.
