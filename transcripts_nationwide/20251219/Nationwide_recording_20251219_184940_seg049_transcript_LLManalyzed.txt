20251219 184940 of justice, Ministry of Industry, and whoever else is involved, come together. Let us set up a power table and iron out our own yard. Because there's going to be a flood in here. We foresee that there will be opportunity for investment. The minister was cautious. I don't know if you picked it up. But we were saved in the outset, in the 2015 act, by one clause. It saved us. A lot of big people who came in here, the whole of Bay Street boys came in here in 2014, 2015, and they stepped away because of this one clause. And I think we should fairly come down, talk with us, and know, the licensees cannot leave our sacraments.
