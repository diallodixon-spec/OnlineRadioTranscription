I've never compared them, so I don't know if the Trinidad one tastes better than Jamaica or Guyana. I don't know which one is the best. I don't which KFC is the best, I've never had it, so I can't tell you which one is best. Somebody who has had, Cory would have to tell you. Cory, like how you have had the Jamaica and the Guyana's KFC, you would have to tell us which is the best. And somebody who has had KFC in Trinidad and Jamaica, they would have to tell which one is best. So, for everybody who is saying, oh, Jamaica the best, but they have never had Trinidadian, KFC, that's not a fair judgment. That's not fair at all at all at all. Judeen says Dwayne your wife know how to pack. Her auntie carry up KFC jerk pork and fry fish. Now me wouldn't take it with Judeen. Judeen me wouldn't take with that too. Me wouldn't take that too. Ya go a foreign.
