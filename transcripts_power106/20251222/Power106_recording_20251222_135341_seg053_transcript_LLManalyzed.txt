20251222 135341 Mr. Brown, that can't be the text you're sending me. Mr. Brown followed everything. He got a narrow list in which of course he couldn't get any more documents and now he owes them storage. And the text coming in one by one saying Mr. Brown got it wrong. Mr. Brown was self-injurious, Mr. Brown was wasting time Mr. Brown was taking up a lot of space at the place because all Mr. Brown has to do is hand people them a brown paper bag, a brown envelope and a little money under the table. what kind of jamaica is that and clearly mr brown has dignity
