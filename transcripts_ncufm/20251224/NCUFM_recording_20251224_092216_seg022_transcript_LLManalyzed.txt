20251224 092216 morning here at nine sixteen during the cruise. This is NCUFM, transforming lives through education and wellness. Hey, this is Glacia and you're listening to NCU FM. Anybody in here dependent on Jesus? I mean like totally dependent on Jesus. And there's no point without him. It's a waste of time without him, right? Feel free to sing with us. This song is simple, it says. Tell me, what can I do? Cause I can't live without you. I can't leave without you. Oh, tell me what can I, I do?
