20251226 160002 I wouldn't be so ungrateful to you You've done so many things for me You'll even make me strong when I was weak So many people wanna see me Stop loving you girl, no way So many people want to see me me from loving you. No one can stop me from loving you Nothing can divide us Nothing separate us Nothing can divide us No one can stop me from loving you, no way Cause I was born to love you, you were born to love me too
