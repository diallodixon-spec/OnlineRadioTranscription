They know the good, they do the evil, hypocritical, they only come here to deceive you now. They know the good and do the wrong Burn it up, burn it down, nothing will be wrong They know the good, they do the evil Hypocritical, they only come here to deceive you They know the good they do the wrong Burn up, burn down, nothing won't be wrong Incinerate them with consuming fire Wicked stuff will melt well like Tyre I don if them all listen to the wire. Burn a soul, sell a run a buy a. Lava down the bloody empire. None of them can tell we notin'. The whole of them greedy and gloatin'. Can't yam with flesh like muddin'. Who the mama heard the vampire them won't come for.
