2025-12-11 16:58:36 You're supposed to be arriving now. 3.30. I can't come in. You're supposed to stay outside the parking lot. I didn't tell you I want to come and work. I want to give myself a little bit of time to calm down. Breathe, do my breathing exercises. I want to study my script. Is this planet earth? I don't think so. People are, I, I, I'm convinced that people be arriving late at work and they say, oh man, I got too early and get fired. Too early man. Can't win guys. Can't win. Too early, man. All right. All right. Moving on. Now black woman tracks down racist online troll and makes him apologize.
