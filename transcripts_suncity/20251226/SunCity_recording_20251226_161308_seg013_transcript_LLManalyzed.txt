20251226 161308 So, so, so Wait till me get you all alone, close to me Girl, me love it when you're close to me That's the way it's supposed to be We love to love it, our destiny Wait till me get ya out in the club Girl, me love is when you close to me That the way it supposed to be Feel up to love with our destiny Oh, thank you's getting hot in the club Thousands of females back in the club Bouncing to reggae and hip-hop in the club Don't forget the licorice rock Oh, damn, It's getting hot in this place Feel all the days like dust in your face Watch all the girls die right in their place Oh, wondering feelings feeling of them. Throw your hands up, dancing on the plane like you're feeling insane, and what? Keep those hands up, now we're up in the club, and at least a rubber dog, and everybody get work up. And I go down the wing, and I go down the plank like the land, playing work up.
