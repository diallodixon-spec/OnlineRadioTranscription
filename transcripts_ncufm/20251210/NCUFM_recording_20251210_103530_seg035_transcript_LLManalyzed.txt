Just cut them and set them aside and then have your heated skillet with slightly oiled, maybe one or two spoonful of olive oil or any other vegetable oil of your choice. And then, you know, then it's your fresh herbs and spices. A very simple combination would be maybe a medium onion, chopped, and maybe two or three stalks of scallion, also finely chopped. Sweet pepper, if you like that, and maybe a pinch of hot pepper, finelyek shot if you want it a little more spicy and also the flavors you like, garlic powder, we like to use little garlic powder, onion powder, paprika is always good.
