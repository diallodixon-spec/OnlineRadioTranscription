20251212 170404 You give me that smooth sailing friendship. We got something that's so authentic. Loving your style is so not basic. We got the time now, let's not waste it. Girl, I wanna keep you real up front with your friends with benefits. Let me run to your band and bless with your face and pick up with your body. Girl, I love your heart. And where do we begin? I would really like to have you number one and be your friend. Girl, you're looking so nice. Don't try it too often. I'm taking a bait I need to know where this is going It's getting late I'm running a dash now Will I see you again? We can make it somehow I'll do it again
