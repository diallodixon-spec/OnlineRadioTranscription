20251223 093621 What the customer service rep told me is that the plan that I am on no longer exists for new customers. Yes, if you have it already you can continue keeping it. But it's not being offered now so if they take it off they'll have to give me another plan which will see my bill being more than doubled. And I don't think that I should have to suffer that. Exactly, because since there are others who would have the same plan but don't have a problem, so it means that the problem can be worked out. It's not as if it no longer exists right across the board, if my understanding is correct. Yeah, I think your understanding is correct because that's the understanding I have as well. So I hope somebody from show is listening.
