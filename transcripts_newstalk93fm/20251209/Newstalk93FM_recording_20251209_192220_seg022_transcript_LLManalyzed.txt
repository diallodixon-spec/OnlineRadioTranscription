What is love? Yeah, yeah, uh-huh I walk it, I talk it, I live it What we do behind doors is our business On my body, he givin' me kisses I'm wet, I'm wetter, I'm poppin' like... Baby, dive in my beach and go... You know there's no limits Nothing stronger than you and I'm sippin' I'm still gonna finish I'm drunk, I ain't had enough One day you hit and you go Who's tellin' me lies and is killin' me slowly? Yeah, yeah What is love? Baby, don't hurt me Don't hurt me, no more What is love? What is love? Hey, what is love?
