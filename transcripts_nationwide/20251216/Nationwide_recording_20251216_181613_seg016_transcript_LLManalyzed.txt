20251216 181613 for the award, including Barcelona teenager Lameen Yamal and Real Madrid forward Kylian Mbappe. The former Barcelona and Borussia Dortmund winger was presented with the award after PSG's Champions League triumph crowned a landmark year for both club and player. On the women's side, Bun Marti continued her remarkable run by being named FIFA best women's player for the third consecutive year. The 27-year-old Spain international enjoyed another outstanding season at both club and international level. Bon Marti was instrumental in Spain's run to the Euro 2025 final with her Finnish runners-up to England and her influence throughout the tournament earned her the player of the tournament award. At club level, she helped Barcelona reach the Champions League final, although they were beaten by Arsenal. Already recognised as the world's best with the Ballon d'Or in September, but Marti became the first player to win that award three times, having previously claimed it in 2023.
