2025-12-12 14:13:31 I barely could concentrate I feel a sugar rush in my vein One cup it does make go say I hold in your clothes I could never let you go All day, through the night, I dreamin', yeah. Miss out she name. When you turn it up, make it smooth, my darling. When outside is pouring rain, put a button on the fire. Bubble in, yeah, bubble in, yeah. Bubble in, it's over. Raise the temperature higher. Coming in, yeah, coming in, yeah. Coming in closer. Make the temperature go up.
