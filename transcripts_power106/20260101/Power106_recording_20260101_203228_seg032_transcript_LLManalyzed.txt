20260101 203228 people and advocating tirelessly on their behalf. The circumstances facing our nation in 2026 present a unique opportunity to restore physical infrastructure and rebuild destroyed housing with greater resilience to withstand future natural disasters. We must empower our people with the practical knowledge on how to ensure that their homes are built back better than before and support them with the materials they need to do so. In restoring our damaged public assets, whether they be roads, bridges, hospitals, schools, water and electricity systems, we must ensure that we invest to achieve greater climate resilience. We must expand mental health support for the many thousands of our people who are struggling to cope with trauma and loss. But beyond the physical reconstruction lies an even deeper task, rebuilding trust.
