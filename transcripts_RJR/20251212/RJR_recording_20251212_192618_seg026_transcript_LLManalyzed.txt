You have one? In school? No, I'm joking. How do you guys access the internet? Is it just through your phone and what sort of things do you do online? Online, I use it for research or just entertainment, you know, like watching videos or something. Okay, cool. On my phone, entertainment, research and work and games. I can see everyone's quiet and I'm distracting you guys so I'm going to give you some skills or rather tell you exactly how you need to approach the online space to be responsible because unfortunately lads, it's on you. You have to know how to use the internet responsibly.
