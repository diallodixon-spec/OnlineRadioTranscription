20251223 103825 I just don't dream. But last night this morning I woke up with one dream or two dreams. The first one, I saw Henry Morgan chasing a Spanish galleon across the Caribbean, across the Caribbean Sea. And I'm saying is this galleon with present-day goals going to land up at Port Royal in Jamaica? You know? And then the dream changed. And I saw a fleet in the port in Sagoramos.
