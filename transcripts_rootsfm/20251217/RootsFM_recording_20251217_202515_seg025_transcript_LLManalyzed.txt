20251217 202515 I will be loving you still And you will always be your everything to me soon Hurry back and bring the sun Let me be your one and only one Cause just one stops the rain from the sky and the cheese from the sky Rolling down my cheese, honey, it's rolling down. Can't you see it, baby? Rolling down. Wearing out my silk shirt, rolling down. It's rolling down, can't you see it baby? Rolling down, wearing out my silk shirt. Rolling down, it's rolling down my cheek. And therefore since you went away, oh every day.
