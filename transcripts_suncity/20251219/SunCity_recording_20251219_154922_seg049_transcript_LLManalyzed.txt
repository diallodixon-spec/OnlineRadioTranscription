I'm a real giant partner, I'ma put a test on every rat. Cause when me say track it up, up, up, and I dress up, I put a touch on it, I lean on it, get the signal you I love it when we're mine with you Drop me a two and them round me with yes I love it when your looking at my face I love it when I'm mine with you, I love it when i'm mine with you Feel a beat, feel she a pop a heart Poppin' up your body and she a poppin' back You know she have no fear
