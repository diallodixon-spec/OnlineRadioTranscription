20251224 181008 I've been patient and I've been waiting Call me stubborn, but I can't get over it You left and never said goodbye Those tears I cried, no, I can get over it So don't you ever Let me down again Cause I'm depending on you So you better come through this time Please hear my cry and if I ever Let you down my friend It was a misunderstanding So we thought you'd get forgotten You I promise from today I'll go drunk like I never drunk Waved like I never waved Wired like I never won before Just to show you I'm sorry, I'm sorry And I need you back in my life Look at people buy me drugs
