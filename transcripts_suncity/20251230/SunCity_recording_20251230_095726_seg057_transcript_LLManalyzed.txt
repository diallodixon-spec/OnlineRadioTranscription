Yes, and do like a squat and hold it for 10 minutes or get a heavy bucket or something. There's something in the household that you must have that can give you that same resistance training that will mimic the gym. Also, invest in buying a few weights home. Yes. You know, you don't have to have this big elaborate gym structure at home. Start small, start small and work your way up. You can achieve your goals, whether inside or outside of the gym. I agree with you there. And what is your take on walking? I found that that is where my best results come from. Literally just walking. I don't know about the excitement and the cardio and this and that. Dr. Harvey, my best results is from consistent walking three miles a morning time.
