I would kiss the ground she walks on. Cause it's my word, my word she'll obey. Ain't no woman like the one I got. Well, I kiss the ground she walks on. To make her happy doesn't take a lot. She's a real good friend right to the end. So together like a hand in your mouth. I'm a lonely man when she's gone. People ain't no woman.
