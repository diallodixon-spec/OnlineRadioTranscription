20251231 130002 Hey, it's one o'clock right here in Roots FM, 96.1 on the FM band. Thank you so much, Adira, for news, sport, weather, and international news. As we segue right into the Must Bus, we start out with Zango Innocent, Crab Walkin', Jamrock Scramble for Africa, and Rise, Madeleine. Yeah, and of course, right after that, DJ Strike Up will take it away right through to 2 o'clock, where DJ String will take over. In the meantime, for joy, the must-bust selections. Oh, yes, must-bust, oh, yes must-bust. They are taking away my rights from me, give on to me the wrong room.
