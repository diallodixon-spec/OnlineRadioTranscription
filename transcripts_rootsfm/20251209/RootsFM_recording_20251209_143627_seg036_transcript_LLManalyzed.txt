With lipstick stains, I've got your tattoo. My double trouble is waiting. It's wrapped up in my bed. I'm tired. I'm sleepy. Can't take the noggin in my head. Double trouble is waiting.

Now fate's behind the door, got a promise or The night is so cold I can't take it no more, no She told me, we heard it I'll be waiting for you honey I'll make some money
