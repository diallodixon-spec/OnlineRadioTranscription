Thanks for having me. Yes, and I get particularly excited being a coach myself with a few championships. What a way to start the American girls club during the absolute demolition of Dominica 18-0, the biggest margin ever in a Jamaica World Cup qualifier. From police show returning with a hat-trick to be 16-10 at the goal. It's good. Jody Brown, Kalysha Van Zanten and several others time in the back of the net. So performance filled with confidence, discipline, and real intent. So it's an echo. Do you want to be able to be deeper into all of this? But let's start here. What was your immediate reaction to the team's execution and overall performance?
