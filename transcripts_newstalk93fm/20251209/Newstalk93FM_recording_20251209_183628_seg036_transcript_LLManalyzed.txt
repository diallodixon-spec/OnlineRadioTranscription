Why you got it? I got it Why you got it one way? They don't want me in their party day They don't want because I do one way They don't want in their party day I ain't don't know about you but I come here to fetch Come to play a mask I'm not leaving until I wet Come to play a mass I don't live my life with regrets No, I come to jam on on a bumper, come to drink on a liquor. Until my head gone and I'm miserable. All down on the ground, I'm causing trouble. Look how the security watch me, they don't know I'm out there. And they smash up the place and I defect like a zombie.
