20251216 125639 management of the Jamaica Public Service needs. They need to have a board meeting now and to address these outstanding issues. They need to address the raise for salaries. They need to adjust the 7% increase, which I mentioned that we are not in support of an increase at this time. I didn't say they must get an increase to them, but at this time, when we are just recovering from Hurricane Melissa. It's a lot. It is really unfortunate. And again, we will not have been having a Merry Christmas. I understand that the 7% is across the board. Whether it's across the board one time, two time or next, it is still an increase and therefore not in support of it better this time. And I go further to say I'm calling for a rollback. I'm calling for rollback and I'm calling on Darrell Voss to come and tell the nation what is this 150 million US dollars for? What is it for?
