That's what came to my mind because I said accounts payables. So the thing is that in order for students to really understand control accounts, although these type of accounts are called single entry, but they still have to understand the double entry that we speak about earlier. We still have to understand double entry ruling in order to know how to do the control account. The truth is that when teaching a control account, we normally have formats. Formats of the total data control account and the format of the total creditor control account. However, what I advise my students is that you don't have the format in the exam. You swatting it, not going to work.
