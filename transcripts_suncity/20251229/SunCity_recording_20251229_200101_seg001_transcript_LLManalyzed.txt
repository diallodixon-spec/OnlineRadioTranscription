20251229 200101 I want to show me a picture from 1992, you know. What happened? You look the same, man. You look the same. Rewind Mondays on Sun City 104.9 FM. Yo, yo, yo, what's the difference? I got a question for you. Oh, so pretty. So hot. Look at my umbrella. Still, I want to ask you, will you cry? No. Make me cry? No. Do something behind my back and then shrug? Cover it up. Well, neither would I. Baby, my love is only enough. Yes. I'll be faithful.
