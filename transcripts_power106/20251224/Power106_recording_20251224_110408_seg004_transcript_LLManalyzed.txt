20251224 110408 Hey, morning. Welcome. Christmas Eve, 24th of December. We are going to be doing something different today. We're going to be taking greetings, we're going to be playing Christmas carols, We're going to turn Ralston from the Grinch into Santa Claus' cousin. We're going to be having a Christmas show today. We'll take your calls, your messages. And we don't normally do greetings, but I was telling Cillies Pinnock a little while ago, when we used to do Smile Jamaica, the segment Neville and I used to enjoy the most was greetings from across the world. Manana sent greetings to somebody who was sitting beside him. From New York, from London, Birmingham, you name it. So we're going to take your greetings today. So you can send greetings to your loved ones, your friends, and they're so
