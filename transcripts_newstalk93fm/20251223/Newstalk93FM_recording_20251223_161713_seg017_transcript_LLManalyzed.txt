20251223 161713 So many people won't lick my skews, so baby chew, make I serve your tools. And if I undo your two by two, you fit to scream, you can lose in your pool. So many reasons are written in the stars on my card, you're the reason I do what I do. So baby make you give me your love. Make you give me that love. If you give me me, I'm not gonna let go. Give me me kakyo, my zanko. Feelings gonna be hitting on the freaky dance floor. Diallo, diallo, if I give you my love, make you no disappointo. Here I got you from hand, oh. Diallo, Diallo, if I gave you my love, oh. Make you no disappointment, oh.
