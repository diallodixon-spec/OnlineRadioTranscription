Check on the elderly, look out for the vulnerable, and keep in mind the families who suffered the hardest blows. They will need our support beyond today. As Leader of the Opposition, I stand with you. I remain committed to a Jamaica where our infrastructure is stronger, the system is fairer, and every community is safer. We will continue to push for a recovery that reaches everyone, no matter where they live. My family and I send warm Christmas greetings to all Jamaicans at home and across the diaspora. We wish you a season of joy and comfort with moments of true connection. May this Christmas bring peace and understanding in every home and may we all carry the spirit of unity and hope into the new year.
