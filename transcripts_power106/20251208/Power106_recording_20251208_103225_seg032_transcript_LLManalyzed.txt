I was saying to somebody this morning, I said, the problem with us now, too many of us sit down and say, look, we're on the side of the two political party, and that's why you notice from, for some time I've been saying that we need a third political party. Because since we have such a large portion of the population who don't believe, who say they don't have no interest in higher party, we cannot hollow less than 50% of the voting population to determine what impacts the life of the majority of the people. Because those who are running down and rabid, they don't care, mostly. All they want, as you say, is a little boom and wipe them, and then dangle them and treat them until the election time comes around.
