============================================================

You better believe it, cause maybe I'm living with something. It's better than the d*** you had before. Smiling cause you know I know you know I. You better tell, I'll treat you well, I will. It's good I can tell, come give me hell. Come give me hell, baby. Tell under your spell, for real. I read you out, I read you out. I read you right away. I read you like no one has ever made you feel good
