Yes. And it's especially a positive sign for persons who, you know, have miscarriage, the women who have experienced miscarriages. And because it's a very traumatic event, a woman can never go through. And so to see that scientists have found a way to study the early signs of the early development of our embryo and see how they can maybe, if they see this is what go wrong, they can further develop treatments or like things so women who suffer from multiple miscarriages can have more accurate and more successful pregnancies and so forth. I can definitely work with that. I can applaud that one. That's good.
