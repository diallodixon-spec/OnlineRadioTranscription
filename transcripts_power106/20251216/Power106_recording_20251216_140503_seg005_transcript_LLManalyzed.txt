20251216 140503 God doesn't intend for you to handle all the pain and stress in your life by yourself. We were wired for each other, we need each other. Life doesn't make any sense without interdependence. We need each other and the sooner we learn that, the better for us all. When we seek for connection, we restore the world to wholeness. Our seemingly separate lives become meaningful as we discover how truly necessary we are to each other.
