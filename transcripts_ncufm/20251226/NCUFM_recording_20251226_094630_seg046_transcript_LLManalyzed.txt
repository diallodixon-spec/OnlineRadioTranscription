20251226 094630 Now, our inspiration today is featuring a woman named Clara who lived in a bustling town. Christmas was her favorite time of year. She loved the lights, the carols, the meals with family, but every year on December 26th felt empty to her. The excitement was gone and she wondered, is Christmas joy meant to fade so quickly? So one boxing day morning, Clara walked through her town. She noticed something she had never really paid attention to before. The baker was delivering leftover bread to the orphanage. The tailor was mending clothes for families who couldn't afford new ones. Children were gathering toys they no longer played with, wrapping them in paper and carrying them to the hospital. Kyra stopped.
