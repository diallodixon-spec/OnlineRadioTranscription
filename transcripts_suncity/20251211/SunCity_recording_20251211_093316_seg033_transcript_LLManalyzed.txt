you only live once, you're not live twice, yo. Follow the road on the righteous path, stay focused and can't just put you in your tartar, say. Don't make the wicked them corrupt your heart. Do the right thing, becoming the worst, yes, yes, all. Take away yourself from trouble, from trouble. Because it come in a double. Take away yourself, from trouble. From trouble. I say, mind the sinking sun. Take away yourself. From trouble.
