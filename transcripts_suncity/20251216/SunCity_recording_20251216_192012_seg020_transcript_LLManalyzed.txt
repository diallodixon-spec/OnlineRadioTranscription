And that's what I want to hear from you tonight. It's just 25 minutes. Only 25 minutes. We ask for you to allow us to hear some songs and dedicate this time to the Lord. The Lord has given us so much. We have so much to give. Thanks for. We've overcome so much to give thanks for we've overcome so much and we need the Lord so much
