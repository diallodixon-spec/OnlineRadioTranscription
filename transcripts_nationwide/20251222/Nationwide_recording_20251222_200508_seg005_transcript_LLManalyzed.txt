20251222 200508 I'd rather die with you I want you In all the morning, in all the evening, we're a punk in the deck I feel amazin', just serve it, I'll keep it, come on baby In all the mornin', in all the evenings, baby I got Moana, I got Benicio, what we have Is something special To you I'll give my all and all My love is unconditional Good things come to those who wait I know your love was worth the wait My life is complete, now I'm bound
