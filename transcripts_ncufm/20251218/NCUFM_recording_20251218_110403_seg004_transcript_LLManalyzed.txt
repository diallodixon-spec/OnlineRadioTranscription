20251218 110403 We declare, you will fight our battle. We declare your blood, your blood has overcome. We thank you for the victory, it's given. And we sing glory to your name, thank you, Lord. Not in my own strength, not in my own power, only by the blood. Victory is already here. You're so faithful, you're so awesome, yes, you're wonderful. Thank you, Jesus.
