20251223 185147 continue to bear fruit, we'll continue to invest in them. I mentioned MOUs. We have a very strong MOU with customs. We have, as I mentioned, one with FID. We have an MOU in place with Crime Stop to push our anti-corruption tip line. And you may very well see that these MOUs become the de facto state for our relationships with all these other law enforcement bodies. And just finally from me Major Jarrett, in terms of MOCA as an organization itself, you made the transition from the JDF to a civilian body. Do you find MOCA to be up to the task, so to speak, coming from your military background as to how it comports itself in terms of operations and other matters? Well, the vast majority of MoCA personnel are comprised of former JCF and former JDF persons.
