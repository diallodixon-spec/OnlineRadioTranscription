20251230 101811 Mr. Mullins, I call you to ask you if you could just highlight this one, please. I'm living in the Washington Boulevard area. And I'm asking you, if you could just ask Mr. Transport Minister, Mr. Vaz, if he could just help us on the Mullins route and the Doheny Park route, Mr. Mullins, it's killing us. So Mullins and Doheny Park? Doheny Park route. What happened? The fare is absurd. Let me tell you something. There's at least four different fare you have to pay. When it's not 150, it's 180. When it is not 180, it's 200.
