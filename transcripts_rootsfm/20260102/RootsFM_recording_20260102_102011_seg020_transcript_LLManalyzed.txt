20260102 102011 It's a beautiful day, it's a beautiful day Don't waste your time, let us unite We've got our lives at stake, oh It's beautiful day, yeah It's beautiful day So yeah, don, do I walk through the valleys of the shadows of death? How if they know we even won't be this way? When I see the clock ticking away And the things are not in place Everything in life happens for a reason Disappointment comes with a lesson. It's a need to get wiser, got to work harder. In the end, it will get better. But I thank you for sunshine, thank you for rain.
