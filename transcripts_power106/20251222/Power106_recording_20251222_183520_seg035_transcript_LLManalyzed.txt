They have a sport park and I did my first skateboard workshop over there and in 2020 I started the foundation because I knew I wanted to do something you know for the youth in Jamaica. In 2019, when I came here again, I started building a skate park in Huey and, you know, linked with all the youth that love skateboarding from, you know, Bull Bay, Kingston, Boston.
