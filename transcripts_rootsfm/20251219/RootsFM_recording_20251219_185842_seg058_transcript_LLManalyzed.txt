But I know you hear me. Maybe my reasons are wrong. But I know that you lead me This is the reason I love my life I was his star for many, many nights Now the roles have changed And you're the leading lady in his life. Lights and cameras are on. Just remember you've been warned. Enjoy it now, cause it won't last. Same script, different story.
