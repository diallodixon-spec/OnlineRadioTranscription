2025-12-11 18:29:41 So it's just now for us to execute all the things that we've been doing at training. In support of Jamaica's hurricane recovery effort, England Netball has pledged to donate £1 from every ticket sold for the matches to a charity of Netball Jamaica's choosing. Fans purchasing tickets online can also add an optional donation to further assist relief efforts. The gesture has not gone unnoticed. Netball England has been really helpful in that term and supportive of us as a group and as a country. So we can't be more thankful for what it is that they're doing for us. The preparation is going good. All the support around us has been good. But like I said, it's personal to put what it is that we're learning, training and execute during the game.
