Be with Desir, who needs money to buy a medication that she needs urgently. Send help out of Zion, Lord. Send help out out of Zion. I pray that those who you have, who have a heart of compassion and love that you'll provide for them so that they can reach out to those who are in need. We thank you that you're a prayer hearing God. We thank you, that you're a God who send your only son to Dan Calvary's Cross to save us. And so we pause to praise you. We pause to give you thanks. We pause to lift up lift up your name Jesus because there's no other name like Jesus that brings hope that brings cheer that brings Lord that peace of mind Jesus Jesus Jesus
