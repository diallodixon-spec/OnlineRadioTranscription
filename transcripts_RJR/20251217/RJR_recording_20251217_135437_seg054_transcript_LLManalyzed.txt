And it's coming from Grandma Pauline, Grandpa Warren, Mother Camille, Father Dave, Brother Ajani, Uncles Andre, and Le Don. Hi to our crew. I'd like to send birthday greetings to my loving husband, Leonard Coley of Hibernia District in Manchester. He's celebrating his birthday today. It's coming from his loving wife Evadney, your one and only daughter Shanae, son-in-law Darian, and your two grandchildren Joshua and Skylar.
