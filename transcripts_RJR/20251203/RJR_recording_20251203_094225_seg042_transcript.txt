Check on the quality and the measurement, right? If you're supposed to get 35 sheets of zinc, count them. Make sure you got 35 and not 31. And deal with the disagreements with your vendor or the dissatisfaction. Please don't let it escalate to violence or let it escalated to the point where you can't resolve it anymore and you have to call the cops. People are a little bit on edge because every dollar counts. So we want you to be taking some care, due care in completing these transactions. And always, always inform the other party. If the material is going to be delivered late, we are asking the businesses and the delivery service company, call your client. Let them know it's going to be a couple days late. Let them know the shipment is short.
