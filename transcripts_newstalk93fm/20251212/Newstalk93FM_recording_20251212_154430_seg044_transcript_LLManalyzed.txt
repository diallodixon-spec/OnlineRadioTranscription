20251212 154430 Oh, so to me, yes. I love you so, never gonna let you go. I want the world to know, with answer to my prayers. I'm loving you so loud, louder than the loudest thunder, higher than the highest wonder. With answer to my prayers, you are the answer to my prayers. You are, you are, you are. You're the... Answer to my prayers. More than a wish upon a star, you're the......answer to my prayers. Was a dream, now reality. True love is here with me. You're, you're, you are. You're the answer to my prayer. I love you so, never gonna let you go. I wonder what to know.
