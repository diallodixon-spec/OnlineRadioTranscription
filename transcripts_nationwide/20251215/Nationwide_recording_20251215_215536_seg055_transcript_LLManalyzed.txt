20251215 215536 I will stay with you when no one else is around And when the dark comes around I will stay by your side And I know we'll be alright I will stay with you Though relationships get old And have the tendency to grow cold We've got something like a miracle I will stay with you Through your ups and your downs I will stay with when no one else is around And when the dark comes around I will stay by your side And I know we will be together
