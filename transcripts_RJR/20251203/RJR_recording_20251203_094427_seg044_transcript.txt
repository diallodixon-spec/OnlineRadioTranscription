what source this water is taken from because it is now causing persons to die, right? They're drinking contaminated water and we are getting the counts now. It's so sad to hear that persons are dying because they've consumed contaminated water. So we are asking persons to be careful and we are asking the businesses, the persons who are in the business of delivering water, please do not refrain from being unscrupulous with your product and your delivery. Because people, it really, really is painful to see people dying because they're consuming something they need so desperately. And we have to warn consumers about those new springs. The public health officers have asked persons to be aware that that's not the kind of water you want to consume.
