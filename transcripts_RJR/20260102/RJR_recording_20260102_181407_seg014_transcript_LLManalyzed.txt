20260102 181407 region with its full measure of devotion. A medical drill occupied the headlines for weeks. This, after opposition spokesperson on health, Dr. Alfred Dawes, raised the concerns about the purchase of a $31 million neurosurgical drill for the Bustamante Children's Hospital. This is not about politics. This is about the blatant misuse of taxpayer dollars. The question is further compounded. What could have possessed someone to spend $31 million on a drill when they could have bought 100 of those same drills? Health Minister Dr. Christopher Tofton insisted that proper procedures had been followed in buying the drill. What matters to me is that the process was followed and that the equipment is being used to enhance the services in the hospital, Bustamante Hospital, saving children's lives. Everything else to my mind is hype.
