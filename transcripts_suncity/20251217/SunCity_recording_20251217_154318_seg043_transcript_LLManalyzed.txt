20251217 154318 Big up to Om Roy, all the way over there in Alberta, Canada. Locked in Sun Millie's set. Sun City, load, load, load. The whole of Kitsitone right now listening to Sun City. Yes, we rate that. Thank you so much for that, Sun Millie, and thank you. She says, go on, spread positivity to the world. That is it, Sun Millie. Big up yourself. And let me just read this last message, and then I'll play some music and read up the messages while I'm playing the music. DJ Spangy is sending love to nix. He's not waiting until Thursday, he's not waiting until Monday, he not waiting until Tuesday, he's sending love now. Okay? So you can go and talk about this Pangea and nobody sent you love when you weren't listening. Well, we know you weren't listening, but you weren't, you know, sending us messages on the WhatsApp line, you weren't active on the WhatsApp line.
