20251226 094530 As mentioned before, today is Boxing Day, the day after Christmas. When the wrapping paper is tossed aside, the feasts are finished and the laughter of yesterday still lingers in the air. But Boxing Day is more than just the day after. It carries a tradition, a heartbeat, a reminder that joy is not complete until it's shared. Centuries ago, people would place gifts in boxes, food, clothing, coins, and deliver them to to workers, neighbors and those in need. It was a day of generosity, a day of remembering that abundance is meant to overflow and that tradition still speaks to us today.
