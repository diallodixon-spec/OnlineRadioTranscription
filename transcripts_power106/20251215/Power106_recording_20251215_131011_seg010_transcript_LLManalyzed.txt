You have to ask the Europeans, ask the Americans, ask the North Americans, ask all the goodly white people around, ask them why they haven't given Haiti a five-year break. So you're now sending me back now to go and study history because... You're better because I'm telling you, Haiti has not received a five year break from anybody. As a Haitian, when you get up something, yeah, before we started to eat turkey, you know, we used to eat swine. Am I where?
