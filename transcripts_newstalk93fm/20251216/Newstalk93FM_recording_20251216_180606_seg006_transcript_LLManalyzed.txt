20251216 180606 I don't listen to nothing they say Every breath I drop Jumpin' up Doin' what I want Jumpin' up Tell them I ain't livin' Right they don't want me going there Until my head gone and I'm miserable All the money grown, I'm causing trouble Look how the security watch me They don't know I'm out there I just smash up the place and I be fat like a jumbie I don't wait They don't want be in their party, they Don't want me cause I choose one way They don't want in their party, I ain't no listen, nothing to say Every time I drop, jumping up Doing what I want, jumping up Tell them I ain't late
