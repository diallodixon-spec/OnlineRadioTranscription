20251217 214740 Oh my god. So we're going to play this Christmas game. So it's to put your food and knowledge to the test since you're not a big chef. So on this screen right here in front of me and for the YouTubers at home or for anybody that is actually watching, you can also play. So you'll see a cropped photo of a popular Jamaican Christmas dish and your challenge is to identify the dish based on the small section of the photo. So, is it sorrel, Christmas cake or maybe a festive piece of curried goat? It's time to show how well you know Jamaica's holiday flavours. So, guests and viewers, get in. Ready. And so and so, right? And it's all about who knows their Jamaican Christmas table best. So let's start the game. Here we go. Okay. Back to God. Ox tail, for sure. Ox tail and bean. Come on, ox tail and bean.
