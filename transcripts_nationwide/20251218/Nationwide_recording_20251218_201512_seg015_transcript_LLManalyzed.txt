20251218 201512 Pretty much. Our nature will. My concern is, is there no inbreeding problem? It's just weird to me. I'm just thinking about it. I don't know that there's a problem for tortoises. I don't think so. Genetic testing of little tortoises. No, inbreeding can't be done with animals. It can, but in the case of tortoises, I don't think, I think because of how human DNA is constructed, then inbreeding is a problem for us as a species. But for like tortoises, et Espanola Island has been done regularly since the 1990s. Now listen to this, it revealed that Diego fathered about 40% of them. Another tortoise called E5. Now listen, Diego gets a proper name and he's just E5.
