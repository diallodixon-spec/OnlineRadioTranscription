20251216 140101 to a Paris labor court last November. While the French champions countersued the Real Madrid forward for 240 million euros, the 26-year-old argued the claim stemmed from unpaid wages, bonuses, and what he described as ill-treatment during the final months of his contract. On Tuesday, the court ruled that PSG failed to pay three months of Mbappe's salary between April and June 2024, along with an ethics bonus and a signing bonus. While the final figure awarded was significantly lower than requested, the court confirmed the club had breached contractual obligations. In a statement, Mbappe's legal team said the ruling reinforced the principle that labor law applies equally within professional football. PSG have accepted the decision, but have not ruled out an appeal. Mbappe joined Real Madrid on a free transfer last summer after seven trophy-laden seasons in Paris, where he became the club's all-time leading scorer with 256 goals in 308 appearances.
