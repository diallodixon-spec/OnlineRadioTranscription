20251225 123730 I lost on the road already Tell them that it's okay I will see you on Wednesday I'm not coming home tonight I'm not going home tonight Cause I need party Girl, don't send no search party to find me I'm not coming out tonight I'm not coming up tonight Cause I'm drunk in the party So why don't't you go to the party tonight? I was a member of the melodies. Now the liquor take all of me. And the bass knock my soul out. I'm extra sober, won't let me leave. I don't know if I'll survive. Song after song, wine after wine. I go sing strong and fit for life. Weak like the masses, kryptonite. You can't find me. We're bound for shaking. people fighting. So complain if they want to know. Tell them you can find me out on the road. I'm ready to walk. Chest up, work. Time to free up. Ghana bow, let me go. Go send us a party to find it.
