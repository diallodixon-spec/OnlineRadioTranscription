No chimney smoke, no bells to chime Just the clock above my head ticking in time but your bright eyes lights up the room alright you're my holiday you're my star tonight sorry santa i don't wanna waste your time give Give someone else a present out that night. Put everything I need right here with me. Merry Christmas, everyone, wherever you may be. I don't need a stackin' or a fireplace.
