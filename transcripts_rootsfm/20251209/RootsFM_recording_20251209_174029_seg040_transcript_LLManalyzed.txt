============================================================

So why should I be afraid of you when you bleed just like I do? The more you try to fight, the more your light keeps shining too. So I've got no time for you. Cause in my view, you want to step in on my shoe. You wish you never live alone, feel so damn confused. How every day you wake, you ache because you know you're fake. And every step you take, I bring you closer to your grave. But I am like a column when I easily shake. The certain set of timid are the one who can't take. We guided by the monster defender of the fight. Yes. All done to be great. HoldOPS FM 96.1.
