This is from Jerry Rice, one of the greatest wide receivers in the national football history and obviously a legend. That's our program for today. Certainly hope you enjoyed it as much as we did enjoy bringing it to you. My name is Kate Williams. Freud Wright is the producer of the show. That being Thomas the technical man. God's willing we'll be back tomorrow at 6 p.m. to present just another edition of the show. We're only near the station for one of his Mondays to Fridays from 6 to 8pm. We are still in the Christmas mood here and David Archie later when you hear me in the background singing Oh Come On Ye Faithful.
