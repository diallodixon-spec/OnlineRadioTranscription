20251215 120606 Just like a script tonight, it keeps me up all night I tell you, I've fallen and died since we have it Sweet woman, we have it Greatest on the planet, boy Suck for the radio loud, playin' a song and it goes in the fuck And if I lose myself inside this place, well I show my shit off If this hoes got unblast when the beat drop past the madness, what's up? Just give me one more shot inside my glass and love where we from We get these powers from this same nation Sweet like steel, drop the sweetest vibrations Don't let the rhythm get you, just run, run, run
