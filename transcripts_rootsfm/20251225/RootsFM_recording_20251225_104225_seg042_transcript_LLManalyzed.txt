20251225 104225 With Santa Claus, I just can't wait. I'll do anything, I'll go anywhere to have you near. I'm making my wish so stars above So I can be with the one I love. Cause it don't feel like Christmas time without you. No, It don't feel like. So there's a hope I'm falling down. And my heart beats, but there's no sound. No, No, No time without you I'm reaching out across this winter wonderland Knowing you're here
