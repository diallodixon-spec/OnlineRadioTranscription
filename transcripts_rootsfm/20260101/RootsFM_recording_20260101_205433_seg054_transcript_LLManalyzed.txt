20260101 205433 Sometimes I wanna walk in your shoes Do the type of thing that I never ever do So I take one look in the mirror And I say to myself Baby girl, you can't survive like this Taking one step back Freaking best in my closet. Y'all safe in it, I don't be skirting. I look damn good, I ain't lost it. And I ain't missing the people you been hanging out at like tonight. I'm staying after tomorrow. Dancing on them tables, ain't got no cares, no sorrows. I ran into my ex, said what up to his besties Now we reminiscing how we used to practice in Texas, don't be jealous If you give me a promise, you can lie, you're jealous
