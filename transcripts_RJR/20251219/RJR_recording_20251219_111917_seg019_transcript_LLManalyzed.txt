20251219 111917 So on Tuesday, I had a conversation with the CEO of H&L and they were talking about exactly these things, the homes. Yes, these complete units. All right, I have him with me. Mr. Chambers, morning. Welcome to Hotline. How are you doing? Good morning, Orville. Thank you for having me today. Yes. Well, great. H&L Homes, it was, believe it or not, in as much as I've been a long time customer of your company and the group, I really didn't know this much about your portfolio, H&L, Homes. Tell us about that. Well, you know, Orville, this is a product that we've been working on for nine years would you believe. You know H&L, we don't put anything to our name unless it reflects quality and so we've been worked on this product for about nine years.
