20251224 141007 She's the one with whom I share up the treasure. Enough, enough love. It doesn't make sense to me, Joe. And baby girl, enough, it hurts me. Anything I give to her, no matter where it cost me, because me love her so much, so me treat her with such tenderness, she and me, baby. Because I believe that love is a powerful thing. I'm feeling deep within. And if you believe in love, free up your mind Let this go within As early as the morning star I'm giving thanks for this lovely thing And if I ever dream me a dream And I won't wake up because you're still holding on And no other girl can hold me, hold me. Hold me so tight. Yeah, baby. None of them ever please me, sir. Treat me, sir. Lord, you feel so right. No girl never squeeze me, squeeze me. Squeeze me so tight.
