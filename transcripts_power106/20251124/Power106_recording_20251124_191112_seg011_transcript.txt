Welcome back. I'm glad you were staying with us. The program is Power Play. My name is Greg Williams. Power Play is heard Mondays to Fridays from 6 to 8 p.m. on the station for 106 FM. The digital sound will all those channels indeed contain. We move on to the second segment of today's edition of the show. And very shortly we'll be giving you a great musical selection from the great Jimmy Cliff. Did you know we also featured Jimmy Cliff? And we have a couple of conversations to take us up to a sports update to be followed by your quote on the day. and then Jimmy Cliff will take us out in style. All right, here we go. This is a long song. He didn't think he could do that. Of course he did a lot of that. And here he is talking about, especially I'm sure he's involved here,
