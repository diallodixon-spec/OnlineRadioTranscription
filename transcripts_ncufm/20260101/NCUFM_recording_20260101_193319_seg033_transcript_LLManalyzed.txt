20260101 193319 Wait a minute, one more time, before I say it again God's been so good to me, he's my closest friend I've got two, four, two, three, four from now I'm gonna stand, I'm gonna wait, watch God work it out somehow No matter what comes my way, I'll lift my voice and say Hallelujah, anyhow! Hallelujah! Anyhow! Alleluia! No matter what comes your way, I'll let my voice go. Alleluia! Alleluia!
