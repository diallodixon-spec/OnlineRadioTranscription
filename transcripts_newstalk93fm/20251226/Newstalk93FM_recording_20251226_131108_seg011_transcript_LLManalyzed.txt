20251226 131108 The greatest pleasure in my life Cause when you're living for the new Honesty, hurry please Home is where the heart should be Pretty feathers in disguise Not together we will rise So don't you ever Let me down again Cause I'm depending on you So you better come through this time Please hear my cry and if I ever Let you down my friend It was a misunderstanding So if I took you for granted Then I promise from today I'll go jump like I never jump We underpin the sky Just running down with high Can't you tell that we're sorry?
