20260102 163719 I'm a rebel, I'm a rebel I'm a rebel Yeah, yeah, you a rebel, yeah, yeah, yeah I'm the rebel, I'm the when you bump up and bubble up. When I go there one time, make me take a double up, you know. Money money in your grave, things are doubled up. A hundred and a grade of cocaine, them are snubbed up. Black milk, so we cobbled up. When I look in my bedroom, my love up and I touch up. Street bars and my bum, I turn it up in a deco. P.A. into one, a deco, it's a yo' honey cup. So I'm gonna burn weed.
