20251229 180906 When I walk on sinking sand Feeling lonely in a crowd When everything's pulling me in every direction You're my anchor, you're my solid ground All I'm searching for is a fight Your medicine for my mind You give me hope You light the morning sun And I'm not alone You give me hope, hope You light like a sunrise No, I'm not afraid Cause you give me hope, oh Such a blessing, oh, oh You're everything, oh, oh Do I say hope?
