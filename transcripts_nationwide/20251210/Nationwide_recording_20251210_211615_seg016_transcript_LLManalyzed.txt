Last night, love you till the sun starts to rise Tell your son to meet at night Take it in a gear and drive it like a jeep I'll take it for a ride Don't be dealing off with the little stripes Don't worry about your money tonight Don't watch your money all night One time, bruh When I'm a real bad girl, then pop up a link It says she won't give me king treatment, cuz she free Be the bad fee like cheap, but she start and fix me He said be the bum, but we are the mess, he said she messaged me She said she don't sleep She don't sleep, don't sleep She said she doesn't see us She don't see us Said she ever need me over there Told her I'ma see her shine the light She told me that you could wake up
