20251223 193622 I don't know where you young people get any information from. But all I know, no hurricane has stopped my Christmas dinner. Here's the list. Eggs, chicken, vegetable. All these things don't make sense because we're not going to find anything. What are you up for there mumbling Karen? Mummy, I just don't see how we're going to get all these things. I don't even think some of these things are available. Girl, put on your shoes, because we're going shopping, so make sure you carry the list. Mommy, look. See, they have chicken, so we can cross that off the list. I don't know why you doubted me that we're not going to find anything, because the government announced just the other day that chicken is going to be available. When I that i know if i if i even just chicken we can do it seven different ways well as long as it fry me good you can keep everything else i know your father can't eat fried chicken so we have to bake it for him oh karen look they have eggs pick up two tray for me
