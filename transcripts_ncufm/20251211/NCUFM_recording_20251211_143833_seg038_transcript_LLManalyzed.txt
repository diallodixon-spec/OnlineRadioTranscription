weeping as they sow. They are hurting, but they are planting. They are discouraged, but they continue to scatter what they have. They're tears. Imagine a farmer planting and the tears running down the face. It's almost like the tears falling in the same hole when he put down the seed. He's scattering the seed about. God is saying, through your hard work, a harvest is promised. And through this passage we can learn something vital. Faith planted in hard seasons produces some of the most powerful testimonies. Have you ever felt like you don't want to go but you push through you're saying you know what God has been good to me. He will carry me through and you up going out there and you have such a wonderful day. You have such a wonderful experience. You've got an opportunity to share God's word with something. You see? Planting in faith.
