Having seen the alert in two WhatsApp groups, he then saw this man walking with the small child in the uniform that he knew was the uniform of the school in question and that something just never looked right. Because that's what it basically comes to. Something never looked right, he took action, rescued the child and held on to the man until the police came. DSP Green, let me bring you in on this point. So give me your perspective now on what has happened here, what has unfolded. Hearing me, DSP? I'm hearing you. Right. So I do believe that the investigations, as they are being conducted now, will tell us a story. We're still trying to put the pieces together we're interviewing persons but I do believe that the the minor was taken from the school as was initially reported but let me pause here and permit me please just to say a very big thank you to Mr. Barr
