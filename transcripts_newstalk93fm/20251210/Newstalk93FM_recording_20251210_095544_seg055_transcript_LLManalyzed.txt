Thanks a lot, thanks a lot. Well, we want a finance minister that will basically look at the affair of Jamaica and when she's on her feet or he's on his feet, certainly you get a level of clarity and come across as someone. The lines are open. We'll take your calls, eight, seven, six, two, one, two, nine, eight, two, four. Let's go to the caller. Hello, caller? Caller? Not hearing that one, Madam Producer. Caller? Hello? Hello? All right. Hello? Hello? Go ahead, go ahead, go ahead. Go ahead. Remember, you're still on the radio, my friend. All right? Go ahead, sir. African?
