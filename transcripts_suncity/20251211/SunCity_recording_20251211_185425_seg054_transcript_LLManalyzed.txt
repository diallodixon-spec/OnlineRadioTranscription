2025-12-12 12:31:55 is not in the likes that you get, or the comments that you get or the video being a trend or a post. I once had a conversation with somebody and they were saying that it's a numbers game. No, it's your numbers game. I don't care about the numbers because really and truly what makes me respect people and admire them is the work they do when nobody's watching. What are you doing and how are you impacting lives when nobody's seeing you, when nobody's going but remember, if you are not secure in who you are, that's going to be a reality. When you constantly have to be showing people, hey, hey, I'm a good person. Hey, I'm loving. Hey, I have a good husband. I have a good job.
