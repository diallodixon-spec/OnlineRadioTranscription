20251217 121413 The 65th RGR Glena Sports Foundation Sportsman and Sportswoman of the Year award ceremony will take place on Saturday, January 16, 2026. With the series on the line, West Indies captain Ruston Chase says confidence remains high in the Caribbean camp as they prepare for the third and final test against New Zealand starting this afternoon Jamaica time. He's insisting that belief and improved batting hold the key to levelling the series after a druggy opener and the first game, we lost the second game, so the only thing left for us to do is to win and we just have to keep believing. I think that we've had some sparks of brilliance throughout the series and it's just for us to put them together for a longer period of time, especially in the batting. I think the bowling has been doing an excellent job.
