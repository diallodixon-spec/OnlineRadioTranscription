Come and pray for Jamaica Out of anyone people, out of anyone people Out of anyone people out of anyone people Don't be Japanese, we love Jamaica, something that will never ever leave We feel the way we see the island I love how anybody needs. We love the sun, we love the sea, we love the cool breeze. Jamaica, don't call it my baby. Wipe those tears from your eyes, don't be crazy. We're gonna rise again, I'm stronger than a name, yeah.
