Customs not go in your package, suitcase, barrel or cargo unless you worship the item or the agent stand up right there when they're inspecting it. Listen, customs job is to protect the borders, collect revenue and to facilitate trade. They don't collect or store shipment, even though it's them we tend to talk about. Look at it this way.
