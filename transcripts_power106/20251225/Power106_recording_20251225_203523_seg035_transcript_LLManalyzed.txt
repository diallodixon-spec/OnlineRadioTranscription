20251225 203523 of all-time Jamaican Christmas in country and in town. Stay tuned. For Winsome Fuller, preparations for Christmas in Amity Hall, St Jan in the mid-50s to early 60s meant intense house cleaning, the washing of crockery and the white washing of houses and trees by community members. Those signs meant the Jingle Bell season and the much have the clappers then. So we enjoyed it, looked forward to it and sometimes you make it a little dolly and you play with your dolly and comb the dolly hair and so it makes you excited. Everybody in the Christmas spirit and you're here.
