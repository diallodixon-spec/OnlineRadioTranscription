20251222 151710 Funny how people always have something to say But I'm finding peace in knowing that you love me anyway. And no matter how I'm feeling, you will never change. It ain't always easy living. But now that I have a choice today I can't help but smile Cause I realize what you've done for me All those battles you won for me And that someday soon you will come for me
