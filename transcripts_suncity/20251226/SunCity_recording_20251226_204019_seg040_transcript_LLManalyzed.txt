20251226 204019 On TNS. I was raised to hustle, but not too old Told to move out, never shown a home Working two jobs, still broke in the phone Whole life gone, and I don't even long Can't rest, can't build, can't breathe They keep us in debt just to watch us plead Post the wins, hide the grief But I'm done cappin', I'm out this leash I see the scam, I peek the game They rich off labor, we live in pain Fake American dream is shame I'm stackin' little LCs, not chains Lil Miss got it locked in. Let me give it to the whole team.
