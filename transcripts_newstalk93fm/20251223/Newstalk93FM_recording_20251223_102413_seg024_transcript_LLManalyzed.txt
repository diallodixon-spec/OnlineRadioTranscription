20251223 102413 Come on, Sabine. Deep as the blue sea, your love's flowing into me And even though the waves are rough, this love is tough, just love me Deep as the blue, deep as the blue sea Love me really and truly And even though the storms will come, no, we won't run. Just love me. Deep as the blue seas. Nice and easy, so deeply we submerge under this emotion. Like an anchor, you keep me safe.
