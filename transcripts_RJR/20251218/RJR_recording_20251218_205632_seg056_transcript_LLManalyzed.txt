20251218 205632 We just have about three minutes to go, sir, darling. We're still talking storage as we are getting ready to close out the program. Secure storage. For persons in the Western region whose homes are damaged and they have lost their storage capabilities, what's your advice? are affected out there. We could make special arrangements for storage. We have offices out in the region. We have police stations because the police don't usually store fire. But at a time like this, we could facilitate storage at the police station. We could do it at the FLA office.
