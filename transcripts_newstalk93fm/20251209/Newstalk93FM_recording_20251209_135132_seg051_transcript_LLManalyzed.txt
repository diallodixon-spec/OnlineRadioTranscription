Not at all In comes King Kabaka, lyrical champion Watch me chop up the rhythm like a sword from Japan So bright and first wind like a real Chinese man Practitioner of yoga but not Indian Lyrics them a weapon of mass destruction Me have nuclear bomb like a American Can't overstand like an Egyptian I'm a glyphic when I shift it to the fifth dimension. And the rhythm not a fit me religion. You get twist up and flat up like a Brazilian. File off your face with the mic in a dance. I come from the nice of the area. I come from nice of Jamaica. I watch your jet. Dance off the clock. Dance and sell off. Lick and sell off. Charge you and sell off. People really see it and have to laugh. Oh, Lord.
