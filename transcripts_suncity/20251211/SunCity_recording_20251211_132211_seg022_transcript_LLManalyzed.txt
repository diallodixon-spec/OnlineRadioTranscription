I wish my daddy was here. For every heart and every, every, every, everywhere. Every year, every day. Oh, Christmas is one time a year. I wish my daddy, my daddy. My daddy. My daddy was here. Oh, I want to see my my baby. I wanna hold you and tell her how much I love her and I miss her. Ooh, I don't know. I was so wrong to leave you all alone and never come back no more. I love you, baby. Oh, I'm so sorry, darling. You better love ya. This one's coming from Ricarda.
