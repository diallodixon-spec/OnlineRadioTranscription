The relationship is split between public office in cricket and political office in St Vincent. and Uttaraj Gaiquad's maiden century of 105 both went in vain as South Africa pulled off a record chase to level the ODI series against India at one-all. Riding on the 200s and Kale Rahul's quick-fire 66-not-out, India posted 358 for five. Marco Janssen took three for 63 for the South Africans. South Africa then came up with a collective batting effort led by Aidan Markram's turn of 110 and 50s from Matthew Britsky with the 66, the world bravest 54 as they got over the line in the final over with the four wickets in hand.
