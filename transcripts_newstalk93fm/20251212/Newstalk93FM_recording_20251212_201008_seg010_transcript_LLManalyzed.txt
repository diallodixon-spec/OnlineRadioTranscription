20251212 201008 Said I'm falling, falling, I'm falling As I lay my bed with my head to the ceiling Say I'm drowning alone and I'm lost in my feelings Somebody send somebody send me a sign, cause you know that I need it. Can't even come back to me, cause you know you're my healing. I said it's okay, it's my therapy. Therapy, my therapy. It took away all of my anxiety. Anxiety, my terapeh Hit ya can't wait, all of my anxiety Anxiety, my remedy I tell ya that we all need love Jump up and show me love, wait up, and show me love Together say we all need love
