20251218 151508 You're listening to Sleek Radio, 93 FM. I don't need nothing from you Your beautiful autism use I've been reckless with my choices Can't seem to get what the point is Life can be rough, can be smooth And not every fact is the truth Advancing, I've laid down my burdens Can't seem to silence the voices You are deserving of the love you are not getting.
