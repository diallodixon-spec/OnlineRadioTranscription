You cannot negotiate from you had the opportunity in 2020 to do so and to come up with a new license that everybody could live. Yeah. So let me think that through because if you renegotiate the terms of the license within the context of the current license, then I think you'd actually be locking yourself in with this licensee because the terms are then favorable. You cut off the scope of even looking outside for other individuals who can introduce things that are probably substantially better than what you now have. And it seems to me that this government has opted not to change, but to say come the end, you're not going to have a rollover. So in other words, are you not wishing for your way to be had and not appreciating the Darrell Vars way, which is different, but not contractually inappropriate?
