20251217 195538 I did 25 points and was named NBA Cups most valuable player. The victory was the next sixth straight and their 10th win in 11 games. That's good form. Although the final does not count toward regular season standings. New York sit second in the Eastern Conference with San Antonio fourth in the Western Conference. And that mascot board story brings us to the end of our sports update. We go immediately to the quote of the day, Danica Patrick, a lady, an American professional racing driver. And she says, take those chances and you can achieve greatness. If you play too safe, you'll never know what's possible. I truly believe that what doesn't fail makes you stronger. And even when you fail, learning and moving forward can be the greatest victory of all. Very wise words indeed from the lady, Danika Patrick.
