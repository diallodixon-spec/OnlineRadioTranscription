I think I think based on what I've said, you have an idea which I've been trying to join. No, it's a party. I will not. I will not second guess you. Yeah, right. Don't do not second guess me. Uh huh. So, which of them? Uh absolutely, Jamaica Labor Party. Absolutely. Why? Absolutely. Well, I tend to tie myself to Dr. Andrew Holness. So, I'm trying to work on uh business ventures right now and how he works, I try to work in that same way because I find him to be very progressive. And I like progression. So words he uses, I tend to take them using like stick-to-itiveness. That was not a word I knew prior to him using it. And that's a word that has carried me a lot through this year because you need stick to-itiveness to really get anything done.
