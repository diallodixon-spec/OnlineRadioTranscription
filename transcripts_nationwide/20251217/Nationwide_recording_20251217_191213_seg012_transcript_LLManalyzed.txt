20251217 191213 to find a solution to a problem, a national problem where all of us together can definitely try to find solutions to problems that affect our people. I wanted to also to be here for a personal reason and that is the fund that I have the distinguished ones leading the secretariat believe our support is not just about funding, it's not just about funding. It's also compassion. It's empathy. It's also solidarity. And when one of us is hurt, it's important for us to be here to demonstrate the solidarity. That's why my presence here is really a testament of the commitment we have at the front to make sure no one is left behind. And when the vulnerable are affected, it's important to be here to show our compassion and our support. And that's why I'm happy to be here. I am delighted this is taking place in the university. Very much reflective of what we believe in the fund. All the actors and stakeholders should be part of solutions. In fact, the university is a center of excellence.
