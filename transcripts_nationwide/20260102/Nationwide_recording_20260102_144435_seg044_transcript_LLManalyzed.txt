20260102 144435 I just want to love somebody Who won't leave a hole in my heart I just want love somebody That don't want me fallin' apart And I'll be lucky if I ever find Something more than just a crazy guy I just wanna love somebody who ain't hypnotized By all the signs of blinding lives like they tend to be I need someone that I pray will take home back my whole time Molest eyes that just ain't gonna live to long enough Even when she's up against me It can't be said I'm a mullet bird It's ten o'clock before I say a word
