20260102 140002 Here in January, huh? Big up to the Two Live Crew, sending a very special birthday to Chate Thompson. Well, that's right, Chate Thompson at Shelton Avenue in Westchester. And of course, birthday greetings to you. It's all coming from Mrs. and Mr. Mack. Do I have time? This one says, birthday greetings to my granddaughter, Carla Brown. And yeah, and that's coming from Derek in Peckham, London. Good afternoon to live crew. Please send birthday greetings to my nephew, Anthony Smith. He's called Fatty of Winterhaven in Florida, USA. And of course, coming from your aunt, Henrietta Brown in May Penn. Final one. Happy 50th anniversary to Lester and Melba Lloyd. I hope they have many, many more from Mount Salem or Bay. And greetings coming from the entire family, especially your daughter, Sons Michaela, and the entire team. That's all the time we have. Happy birthday. If it's your birthday, happy anniversary.
