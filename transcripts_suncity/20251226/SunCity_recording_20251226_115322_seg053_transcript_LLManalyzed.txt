20251226 115322 Here we go. Here we go. Oh, girls You know you are the one for me Oh, girls Oh, girls And girls You know you made my dream come true My dream come true, if my dream come true. Tell me some girl from over London, girl from over Spain. I'll give them a call, notice the wind. Send them on the sugar cane, send them on the vein. Tired of the snow, send them off to feel the rain. She never drive a car, so she have to take the train. Wish my me live round a Sherlock.
