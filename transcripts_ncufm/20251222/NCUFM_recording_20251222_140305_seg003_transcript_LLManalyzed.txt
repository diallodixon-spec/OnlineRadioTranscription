20251222 140305 fan during Sunday's 29-24 NFL win over the Detroit Lions. Television footage showed Metcalf approaching a Lions supporter leaning over the railings at Ford Field in the second quarter, grabbing the fan's wig before seemingly throwing a punch. The fan, later identified as Ryan Kennedy, said he had called out to the player moments earlier using his full name. Officials did not witness the incident, allowing Metcalf to remain in the game, where he finished with four receptions for 42 yards as the Steelers recorded their third consecutive victory. However, the NFL has since confirmed it is reviewing the altercation, with Metcalf potentially facing a fine or suspension depending on the outcome. The Steelers' win strengthens their playoff push as the regular season enters its final stretch. And finally in tennis, Australian star Nick Prigges is edging closer to a return to competitive tennis after being awarded a wild card entry for next month's Brisbane International. The 30-year-old has played just five singles matches in 2025.
