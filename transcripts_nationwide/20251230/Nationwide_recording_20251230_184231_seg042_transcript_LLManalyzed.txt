20251230 184231 I just want to say one thing that is worthy of noting, however, is that the design of the network in some communities is aerial, right? And we're ready to get a certain level of hurricane as it was in the case in areas of St. Elizabeth. If the network is completely decimated, what took some time was the complete rebuild of the network. um if i may say so i've understood that you know jps has you know expressed similar uh point so to the extent where we can put miles and miles of the network underground we're doing that but depending on the strength we've done all the backups all the residences the powers the generators the fuel arrangements the inventory of equipment but i just want you to understand and the listeners to understand that in areas where the complete rebuild of the network is required sometimes it will take some time that's not dereliction on our part it's just a force of um the nature of things
