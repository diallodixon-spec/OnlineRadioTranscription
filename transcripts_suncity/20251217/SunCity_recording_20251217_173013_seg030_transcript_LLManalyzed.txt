20251217 173013 It is now 530 p.m. Hey girl, what's up? So hold on. Why you look so vexed this early? They're not just that. Lisa, it is so good to see you. But sorry you catch me like this, girl. My uncle sent one by now and my family go for clarity. You don't want to hear the price the people then put on or something. My mother's the worst, me here's the worst.
