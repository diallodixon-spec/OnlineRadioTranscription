20251231 165340 and her entire family. This is amazing. Look at this. This is beautiful. Congratulations, June. You have a wonderful family. All look well and comfortable over there in Norway. And it seems to be a lovely time as you get set to ring in the new year. Everybody under one roof. The food's going, the drinks are flowing, and it looks great. Congratulations, June, in Norway. Beautiful picture. Beautiful picture. Thanks, June, and all the very best to you and your family. All right? All right. All right. This message says, Mr. Jesse, do you know that some of the churches have to bury their members, not the ones who give the big money because they choose to worship at that temple? In our denomination, we have a care fund to take care of the less fortunate.
