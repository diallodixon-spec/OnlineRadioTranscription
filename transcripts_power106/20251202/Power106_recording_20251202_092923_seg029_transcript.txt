of GDP in tax revenues, $260 billion or 7.91% of GDP in borrowing, $4.629 billion or 0.14% of GDP in grants, and $887 million or 0.63% of GDP in transfers from the Capital Development Fund, which was created by the former Prime Minister Michael Mandel during the 1970s. Nominal GDP was originally projected at $3.289 trillion during this fiscal year. The finance minister at the time, Nig Klath, was supposed to tell the world that he planned to finance it until March of last year, but he never did so until October 8th after pre-selling some 12 years receivables from the Norman Mann International Airport for $75.5 billion and then promptly jumped ship for the Washington-based International Monetary Fund. Both Fitch and Moody's have placed those special vehicles on a ratings watch negative. The government is also projected to spend $1.26 trillion during this fiscal year, $126 billion less than the revised $1.3 trillion it spent last year, and the plan is to finance it with $949.49 billion in tax revenue.
