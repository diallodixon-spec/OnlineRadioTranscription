20251216 203122 Life won't be the same. Dying for a cure. This is how the story goes. Wasn't fool for love, ready to propose. Wasn't lady or suppose. Thought the perfect girl was the one he chose. Now he's thinking something else. Worried about his failing health Nothing's on his shelf That ever seems to help Now he's dying for a cure He just can't take it Crying from the core And nothing can change're living right, it's your life, yay!
