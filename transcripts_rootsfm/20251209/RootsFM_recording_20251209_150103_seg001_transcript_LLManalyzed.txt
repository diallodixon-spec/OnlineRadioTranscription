Let me see you bustin' like you're just a gay. Girlfriends when you roll, wind up your body gets out of control. She goin', she goin', she got soul. Pretty like money, girl, pretty like gold. Wake up to the tubs, you know how we roll. Have to get a call because we depp on patrol. Go extra, let them girl too hard, she gets cold. Girl, them love the flex, so we cold. Cold like the dogs pull. Let me see you bustin' in the air When I see no one we play with and we scare Let me see you burstin' like you just don't care
