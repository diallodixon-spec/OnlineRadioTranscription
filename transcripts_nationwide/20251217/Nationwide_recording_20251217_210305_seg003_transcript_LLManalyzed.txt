20251217 210305 I have a co-worker here, right? So Kronix, if you hear this, her name is Norah Gay Banton. Norah Gay is one of Kronix's biggest supporters. Like, what I'm telling you, every single song, even the song, they were not even, like, chart-hard. Like, well-known like that, she knew them word for word. No, man, I'm telling you. And every day she'll say, Jesus, all I want is just an album from Kronix, who else is one of your influences? I have a lot of influences, so I don't even know which one to start with. We can go with Berries, we can go with my grandfather, Hobarton Lewis, on a more international scale.
