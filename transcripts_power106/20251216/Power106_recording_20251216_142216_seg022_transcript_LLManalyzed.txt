20251216 142216 that is concerned yeah yeah it's not exactly winter solstice just yet winter solstice begins this Sunday coming so officially it is still the autumnal equinox but those cooler temperatures have descended especially on the diaspora in North America and other relatively cooler sections of the world definitely looking well number of those areas are experiencing those cooler than normal temperatures at this time not as temperate a climate as what we have here in Jamaica although the maximum temperatures expected for both Kingston and Montego Bay have been trending down in the last week or so usually would be around 32 33 they're getting more 31 and 30s we had at
