20260101 111812 Now I'm looking in your eyes Somebody tell me how Cause I would've never had imagined You and I would be rocking with each other. Take my heart and sit down. I feel you ready. I never knew I'd need a feature. You say if you keep singing, I bet you I'm on the street. You're such a keeper. Turn it up like a speaker. Pull it up and repeat. As long as I know it know, say it's sweet, oh. Cause anytime you cross your mind, you would jump in and speak, oh. Drive many miles, just to repeat, oh. I'm gonna feel speed on me, oh, baby. I would have never had imagined you in that.
