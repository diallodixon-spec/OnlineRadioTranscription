So for anybody who is sitting down where you might feel as though, boy, never make as much money this year. You are alive today, and God's willing, you're alive tomorrow. God's willing you're alive for 2026. You get the opportunity to make that money that you didn't make today. You never find the love of your life, no worry yourself. Man or woman, don't shout.
