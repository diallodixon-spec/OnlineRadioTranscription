For something you don't longer have You should have been around me tonight Someone else is holding me tight right now, girl You should have been holding me tight Someone else is around me tonight, right now, yeah You should have been here right now Won't even die tight till the morning light Should've been around me tonight Yeah, you're crazy, crazy, crazy for what? You're crazy for something that you've had You're acting all crazy, crazy crazy for what? For something you no longer have You should've been my lifetime Your emotions left you blind I called your phone at the right time I saw your message on my life Late night in the studio Staying on my grind That love and hip hop told you bye
