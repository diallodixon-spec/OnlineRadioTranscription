20251229 121009 can get a mediation, even if you can't afford a mediation. Of course, there's other ways of doing it. There are private mediations where you can ask a mediator if you're already afraid with the process. You may look for a mediator at the Dispute Resolution Foundation. So it's easily accessible. What I'm advocating here is being proactive. So prior to a disaster, have trained teams in place, whether they be legal professionals, whether they be mediators, who can actually have the authority that when a disaster hits, you have these teams in place that go to community centers, that go to facilities in order to assist people, or Disputes Resolution Foundation have been utilised in landlord and tenant disagreements. Oh yes, oh yes. Mainly land matters? Land matters and community matters as well. What would be a community?
