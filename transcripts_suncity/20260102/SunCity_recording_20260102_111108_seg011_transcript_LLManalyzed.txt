20260102 111108 Thank you for joy, thank you for pain. It's a beautiful day. Beautiful day. Beautiful day, yeah. Don't push and bite. Let us unite. We've got one life, so let's make it right. It's beautiful day So yeah, go I walk through the valleys of the shadows of death I will fear no evil won't be dismayed When I see the clock ticking away Things are not in place Everything in life happens for a reason Disappointment comes with a lesson It's for me to get wiser, got to work harder
