2025-12-12 10:56:50 our hardest hit Appleton as you know is close to where the epicenter of the storm so we had some damage we had some structural damages nothing major compared to the rest of the community but we also had staff affected so when we think about the impact of the business for us is our staff yes the first response for us was our staff our staff who lived there would have lost their rules and so we have a very large encompassing staff program that we're rolling out now, a welfare program to our staff. It is about rebuilding their homes, about providing medical and mental support. So we have that program going on now. So we're providing grants to the staff. So for us, we're doing everything we can to ensure that our staff recover is the businesses we support recover or communities recover. So we're doing several things to ensure that we rebuild together and stronger. Good. Thank you very much, Samara.
