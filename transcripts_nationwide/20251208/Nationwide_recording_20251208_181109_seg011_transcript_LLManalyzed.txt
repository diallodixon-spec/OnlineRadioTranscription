A British High Commissioner to Jamaica, Alyssa Herbert, is counting down the days to the start of the FIFA World Cup finals next year. Herbert has particular interests in England and Scotland, who both had interesting opponents at the group draw in Washington last Friday. England are in Group L with Croatia, Panama and Ghana, while Scotland will face Brazil, Morocco and Haiti in Group C. England, who opens against 2018 finalist Croatia on June 17, is set to reignite members of their 2018 World Cup semi-final where the Three Lions fell short. England's only World Cup triumph came in 1966 while Scotland has yet to lift the trophy, adding extra spice to what promises to be an unforgettable tournament for British football fans. High Commissioner Herbert believes England has the history and the talent to make a deep run, and Scotland has a golden opportunity to finally make their mark.
