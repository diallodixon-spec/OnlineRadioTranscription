20251215 101509 the local government are doing something you understand me so many different politicians are doing things so him can just answer if him answer it would only be the answer would only be from what he's doing so he had to gather information the man didn't look like he knew hardly anything because the man said how much people have been I think he what he had to be very careful How how many times have they received packages? Can you confirm the man can confirm nothing? Okay. Yes now because obviously it was arts I've gone now and got all of these calculations together, but for me Middle business I don't see it I'm not saying I didn't give because they must have give some because they have to do it to make it look good. But I refuse to believe that 225 million has been spent and a big majority of that on food for the people then. Because if they're saying they spent that and we as a people them and artists them did what they did.
