20251224 210503 But I'm gonna be changed, in a moment, in a twinkling of an eye. Oh it's, cause at the midnight cry, one of these days He's coming back for me. At the midnight cry, I can hardly wait till Jesus returns. Cause at the midnight cry When Jesus, when Jesus, when Jesus comes home On a cloud that calls his children He's gonna call his children But's hear it twice. So long to meet in the end. Vain a boy.
