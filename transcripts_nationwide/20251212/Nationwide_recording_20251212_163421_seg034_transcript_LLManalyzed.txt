20251212 163421 I don't see the internet or the media as a way to lash out or bring my business to so if I have a disagreement with Kareem I would never come on the internet and say Kareem, I don't like your shades. Your shades are bad but I use it as an example. I think that clout and all those stuff is something so we are drive with culture and everybody wants it so a slight thing will come up is a problem so the reason the reasoning behind of the whole ups and downs I feel like it's playing and and telling to how people have seen my career go. You get me? I've had my ups and I've had my downs. But one thing the downs never yet keep me down. I'm always fine. God bless you.
