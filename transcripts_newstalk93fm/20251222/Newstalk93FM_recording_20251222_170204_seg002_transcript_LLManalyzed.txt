20251222 170204 I have a lightning spirit Early in the morning I had it Me cooler ready Me heist done ready Me punchin' that's automatic I have a lightning jumbie A kind of energy inside me And it ready for the rum Ready, ready for the rum, ready, ready, for the rum Ready for the action A spiritual encounter In me soul taking over So let we go, let we go down the road Let we go, it's action time let we go It's bacchanal time we go! Hands up! This sweating spirit havin' me feelin' good!
