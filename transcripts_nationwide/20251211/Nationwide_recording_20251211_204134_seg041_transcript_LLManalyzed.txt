2025-12-11 20:55:13 Kids birthday tune I get me upset. No, but then I don't have that problem. Oh, but then Yeah, and always uptown birthday party, okay Yeah, yeah No, but then that's a one thing because I think so far I've not had that issue I can say mm-hmm so far have not had that issue because I think give thanks the parents that we interact with. Okay. Have at least for understand say hey you know this is a kiddies party. You might hear some ding-dong, some little ding-dong and so forth which is fine. Corporate ding-dong is quite good. Big up to ding-dong. He's going to be a dad soon as well. Big him up. Congratulations. Happy to have you on Jamaican dads by the way, Ding Dong. One of these days. Yeah man, absolutely. So what my child will probably hear is, like I said, Chris Stapleton and so forth.
