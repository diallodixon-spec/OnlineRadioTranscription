20251225 101006 so different being here i was so used to being next to you life for me is not the same starting over it's so hard seems like everywhere i try to go i keep thinking of you i just had a wake up call wishing that i'd never let you fall maybe you were not to blame at all but i'm the one that pushed you away maybe if you knew i could you'd have never went nowhere but i should have been right there how would i breathe without you here by my side? How will I see when your love brought me to the light? Where do I go when your heart's where I lay my head, when you're not with me?
