20260101 215825 You turned out to be the best thing I've ever had. You turned out to me the best thing I'd ever had. And I'm gonna be the best thing you'll ever have. It's up to you right now to set your heart to gold. Oh, did you expect me to care? You don't deserve my tears. I guess that's why they ain't there. I think that there was a time that I almost loved you. You showed your ass, and maybe it's time to reveal you. Thank God you're blue, and thank God I blew it. Thank God I'm so over you. Baby, good luck again now. Won't it you be? I'm so through with it. Cause honestly, you deserve that.
