us into all truth amen amen and amen amen so how are you um pastor michael how are you how's england uh england is cold well not really it's six fifteen thirteen degrees so that's better than last week oh wow gosh i hear that there's some super flu going around is it true or is it just propaganda? Because I've seen it on the news pages. No, there is a type of flu affecting people, you know, making some of them have to just stay home basically and not engage with other people because they don't want to spread it or be contaminated even more. So we can only thank God for healing and restoration and that the people will recover yes that's our desire and that's our prayer wonderful so today's reflection is anchored in psalm 70 verse 2 a powerful reminder of divine opportunity and unshakable access the verse
