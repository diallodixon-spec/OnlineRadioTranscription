20251224 161213 okay and also just uh based on your question my what you call new yorkese tradition used to be going out to a party where i'm home at 12 and then i'll go out after 12 but the last couple years i've kind of been a homebody so that's what i'll be doing again this year you know as you get older you realize that you really don't need to be outside. Like the night Jew by your face. Stay inside and cover your mole. You get sick and stuff. Stay inside. It's safer inside. I also just wanted to say to the NNN family, Annie Smith, Errol, Rick, Marigold, Jean, everybody else, you guys have been awesome the year and I appreciate you guys. Thank you. Bye bye.
