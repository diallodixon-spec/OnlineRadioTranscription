all right which is why which is which is is important next time because the next time you do this go to lawyer first all right thank you okay all right one the other thing with the lawyer was saying to me that if i go to the court it would have cost me um a lot of money right is there another way i could do it by myself um to go you know is there another option option? Well, as I said, I don't know, in relation to you and the individual, arbitration could be one, but I'm not sure who would lend itself to that, because it's a situation of transfer of land and so on. I would always go to the courts and so on for things like that, you know, unless there's some provision in an agreement about arbitrating these matters. Because it seems to me the issues are pretty clear. You pay for the land, you want the titles, and now what's there to arbitrate over? Follow? Go to court and sort it out. All right? But let's take another look at who does that kind of work. Thank you.
