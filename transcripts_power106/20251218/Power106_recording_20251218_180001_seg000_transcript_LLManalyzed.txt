20251218 180001 Last night and beat the living daylights out of the eight meds of milking because they found them carrying on with the eleven lords of leaping. Meanwhile the swans got over the living room where they've been hiding since the big battle and savaged hell over the lords and all the maids. There were eight ambulances here last night and the local civil defense as well. The mother is in a home for the bewildered and I'm sitting here up to me neck in bird's droppings, empty whisky and valium bottles, bird's blood and feathers, where the flaming cows eats the leaves off the pear tree! I'm a broken man! Come to Shawlownessy! Guarding services, alarm monitoring and response, vehicle tracking with stolen vehicle recovery. It must be King Alarm. The time by King Alarm is 6 o'clock.
