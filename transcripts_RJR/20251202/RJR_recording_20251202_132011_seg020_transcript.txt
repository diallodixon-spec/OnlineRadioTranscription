Active for the good of the nation. Two live crew on the Big 94. It's a Tuesday afternoon. Good afternoon to my sister, Dalia. How you doing, sis? I am doing great, Johnny. How are you doing? I'm up and running, you know. December. Yeah. We're trying to make sure that we at least bring some energy and some cheer and some joy to the end of the year. So we're keeping it positive sis. We're keeping it positive right through, you know what I mean? Yeah man, definitely. It is the month for it, the season for it. We're spreading love. It's the season for love, giving every piece joy.
