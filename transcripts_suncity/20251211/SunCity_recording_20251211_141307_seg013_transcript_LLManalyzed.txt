It's not like I can't escape What's in my soul? Cause with you, so hard Where can I go? I don't go through life without you. Without you, there's no me. Why do the days come before to stand? Why the summer startin' too? Why do the wishes come too soon? Why do people fall in love when they're always thinkin' of home? Why?
