20251219 151411 The good thing that, the good thing that The good thing, the good thing, when we do I feel that the good thing, the good thing The good thing, when I do what? I feel the good thing then The good clothes and the good shoes then Good chain and the good ring then I shop in the mall at the good store then My car when I drive at the good car then No chicken head, that's the good girl then Pretty face with the good shape then, I'm not running, that's it good. I got a country girl that told me set me well up. Had to sing in the streets and now we say that's it. Everything when me put on the mouture to look with the tan, Jimmy Choo with the lion, Balenciaga. Someone said dem a god, me a god. Let me wait in a bit while I let me man up. Every girl is incomplete, you don't put it on, put the feet, it doesn't fit in.
