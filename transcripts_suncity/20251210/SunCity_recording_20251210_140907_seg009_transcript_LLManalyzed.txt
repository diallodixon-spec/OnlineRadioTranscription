============================================================

Just leave up right and sit down And you will be okay, okay Sit down first and if you're lost You will guide your way, you will guide your way Like a swing Looking at the shooting star Up in the sky so far And the moon that shines in the night That make me you It seems like it's daylight Only a supernatural, actual, ordinary person Could do what you do So I know we've got to be you. Change my heart, change my heart. Change my bones, change my bones. Change my song, change my girl. Change the one that runs my world. Change my everything, change my everything.
