20251226 214120 Season greetings to you and your family also. All the best, man. One Sun City. One fry eye. Yeah, man. Your son, Jack Fry, I, the ultimate Sun City, keep it blazing. All with the rain fall, and the ground wet. Sun City, the bloodiest, and the rum chat. I said, I'll know, because I'll know. Because I'll know when I see it.
