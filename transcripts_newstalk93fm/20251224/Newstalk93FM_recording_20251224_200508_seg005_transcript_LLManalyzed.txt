20251224 200508 I'm not coming home tonight, I'm not going home tonight I'm drunk in the party, so I don't think no such party can find me I was clapped by the melodies, now the liquor take all of me And the bass knock my soul out of my chest, so God won't let me leave I don't know if I'll survive, song after song, wine after wine I go say shung a pitful life, weak like the mass script tonight You won't find me find me where bumper's shaking. Highest meeting, people fretting. So complain if they want to know. Tell them you can find me out on the road. I'm ready to walk. Chest up, walk. Time to free up. Gonna bow and let me go. Don't send a third party to find me. I out on the road all night. Tell them that this hookah hang me, you'll see me Wednesday I'm not coming home tonight
