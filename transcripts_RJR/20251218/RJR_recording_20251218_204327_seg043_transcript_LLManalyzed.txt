If you're overseas, if you're a US citizen or a green card holder, that is not an excuse for not coming to renew, register the firearm. Because the law actually provides that if you're not an ordinary resident in Jamaica, you ought not to have a firearm because it's to protect life and property.

So if you had a firearm previously and left Jamaica to live elsewhere and visit occasionally, you should not be maintaining the firearm there.
