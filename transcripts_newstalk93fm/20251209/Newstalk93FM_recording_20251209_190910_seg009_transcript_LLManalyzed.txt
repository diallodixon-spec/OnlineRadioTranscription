But I just keep on saying Baby, baby, baby Oh baby, baby, baby No way, baby, baby Baby, baby, oh Thought you'd always be mine Girl, I got you so right And I know you like So come on, push it on me If it feels all right Wanna drop it low and break me up No, she doesn't mind, she doesn't mind She doesn't mind Girl, I got you too Push it back on it, get back on it Give me the thing, become a waffle lock on it Bind it, wiggle it, set the track on it Two more shots, now we in a hot panic Two girl and I'm ready to jump on it True to my word, I'm ready to dump on it Ready to run on it, ready to dunk on it Tag team in for your truck, we pump on it Heads up high, we burning up the sky. We got the devil crazy. Got the club on fire. I like the way you dance. You got me. Push it back on it, bring it back on it. Give me the thing.
