20251224 095643 I'm a bee, in a dangerous mood, can you match my timing? Telling me that you're really about it, why'd you hide it? Talk is cheap, so show me that you understand I like it Can you blow my mind? Set it off my whole body. If I give you my time, can you stretch my soul from it? I don't want to wait. Come take it. Take me where I ain't been before Can you blow my mind? Set off my whole body, whole body Make me sweat
