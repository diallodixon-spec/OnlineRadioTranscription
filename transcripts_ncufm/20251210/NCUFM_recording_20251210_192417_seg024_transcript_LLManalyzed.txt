============================================================

those who are have been affected by the hurricane Melissa and are distraught at this time, not knowing what to do. Some of them are so depressed because they they they they look at their future and they see no future but there is a god. There is a god who cares for his children. We just need to reach out to you Jesus. we just need to hold the touch the hem of your garment like that woman with the issue of blood did and was healed. We need to learn to reach out and touch you, God. Touch you, Jesus. So that whatever is bothering us, whatever is taking a hold of us, we are able to stand up and stand out like the palm tree on the hillside knowing that God is on our side. Then I ask you to remember, remember those who are doing their exams at this time. It's exam time to close off the year.
