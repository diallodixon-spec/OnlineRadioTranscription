When they call you must answer, respond with your hands up In my flesh, in my mood, I can feel it up in my soul Lighten up everything I know, everything I know. Hey, this is rock, this is road. This is vision and this is hope. Soak our spirit best in this world. Come and let it show. And it's all day. The spirit telling me jump until I'm all in. And we're not going to stop until we're all in.
