Meanwhile, JPS says electricity has been restored to cotton tree and areas from Anchovita to Biggest Steath in St. James and the NWC's Rock River Pump in Claridon within the last 24 hours. The Office of Utilities Regulation, OUR, says JPS customers currently receiving service will see a 7% increase on their December bills for November's consumption. In a release today, the OUR says this was anticipated as JPS has had to rely on more expensive fuel sources for generation because of Hurricane Melissa. It says the big hike is also due to an increase in the fuel and independent power producer IPP rates after JPS sales dropped by 30 percent. But it says JPS will defer some of the increased costs and recover it by spreading it over the next six months to avoid bill shock to customers. The OUR says it has urged the JPS to discuss the added charges with the regulations
