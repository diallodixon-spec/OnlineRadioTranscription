20251223 110810 It's so easy to fall in love with me They say the holy water's watered down And this town's lost its faith Our colors will fade eventually So if our time is running out day after day we'll make the mundane our masterpiece oh my my oh my my love i take my look at you you're taking me out of the ordinary i want you laying me down to the dead and buried? On the edge of your knife, staying drunk on your vine. The angels up in the clouds are jealous knowing we've found something so out of the ordinary.
