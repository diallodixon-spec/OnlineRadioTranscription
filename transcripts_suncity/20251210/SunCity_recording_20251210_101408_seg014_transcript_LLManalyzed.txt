Perfect as it starts. I'm thinking movie. So You know, we've all traveled through heartbreak and healing and you know loss and and stuff What advice would you give to your listeners or to our listeners? Hoping to rediscover love this season or just to rediscover love in general, you know, what advice would you give to our listeners? Slow down, don't rush. Slow down. Don't rush. Listen, listen to your, listen to your heart, really. Pray, hold that, pray without ceasing. If a family must come from you, it will come from you. If love is what you desire, then you will be loved. But the true love that we all need, it is literally sitting in the hands of God. And He's just getting ready to hand it over to us on a platter. But we have to pray.
