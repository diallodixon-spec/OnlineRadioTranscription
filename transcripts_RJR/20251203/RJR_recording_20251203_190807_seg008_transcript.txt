might happen in life. So you always have to have a plan B. I could have given up, but I decided no, you know, this in this life, there are a lot of unpredictable things that can happen.

So I decided, you know what, if I have the ability to pursue another path for myself, or at least open that path for myself, I'll do it. So I decided, all right, you know, the music is taking off. I love the direction of where things are going. But at the same time, let me also work on this backup plan, you know, in the event that something might fail. I love it. Law is your backup plan.

You know, the funny thing is, every time I go off to start the application process, something will happen.
