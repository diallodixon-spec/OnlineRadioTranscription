20260101 142515 All the night is my world City light, painted girl In the day, nothing matters It's the night, time that matters You take me safe, you take my self control So you can't be living only for the life Before the morning comes the story's told You take yourself control I live among the creatures of the night I haven't got the will to try and fight Against a new tomorrow, so I guess I'll just believe it Tomorrow never knows, I said NIGHT!
