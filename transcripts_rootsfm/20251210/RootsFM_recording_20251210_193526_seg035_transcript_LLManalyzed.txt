Imagination, imagination Imagination, imagination Imagine being with you every hour of the day Loving you in a certain kind of way Can you understand what I'm trying to say? You're like a bundle of cotton in my arm Girl, you're ripping me off with your charm Imagine waking each morning with you In my life At night I close my eyes. I imagine I'm loving you. It's that old song they're playing, baby.
