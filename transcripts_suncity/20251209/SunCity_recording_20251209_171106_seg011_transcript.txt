victory in the Visit Jamaica trophy at odds of 99 to 1. Winless in 16 starts this season, the Donovan Russell-trained runner piloted by Jackie Roger Hewitt surged from the back of the pack in the final strides to snatch the win in the six-and-a-half furlong event. He edged out Chesney by a nose with Rockola finishing third. The winning time, 1 minute and 25 seconds flat, marking Russell's first victory of the season from 30 starts. A dramatic finish and one of the biggest surprises of the racing year. That's it for this evening's sports report. Up next is our entertainment news. It's now time for your entertainment.
