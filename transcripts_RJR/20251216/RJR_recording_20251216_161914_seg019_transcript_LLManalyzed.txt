20251216 161914 And I get lost in your eyes I'ma gain all my soul Girl, you just captured my soul I'm a gain all my soul Baby, wanna just take you home I'ma feelin' vibes on vibes I'ma takin' dynamite I blow your condo lights You know I'm just that type No No, I'm not thinking. I'm not thinking I'm not thinking Why is that? If you hit your enemies, enemies shine. If you're not a friend of me, enter the light. Cause you can never kill my vibe. Cause there is no sacrifice. Is everything worth taking? Still have to make it vibe killer. See, I'm not gonna take you. Vibe killer. That my leader broke that my energy from your father right? That my pastor say I'd be my healer.
