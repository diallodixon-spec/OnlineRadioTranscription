active for the good of our nation. I'm happy to be alive, happy to be here. Good morning. You're listening to Radio Jamaica 94 FM, and this is Hotline. Orville Taylor is here. The man in the middle, the man in black. Daniel. Not here. Not here. I know that you weren't all here but not HAIR, right? No, you're you're looking company. I'm not in your company. Meaning what?

What, because you have a beard? No, but I can grow here. Meaning what? You never see me. You can grow here too. Oh, I would imagine so. Exactly. But not by your head top.
