20251230 175635 August, he had done a little feature that he posted on his Facebook page that I watched again and look up in the series again. That just spoke to Mr. Craft, how he managed to put the script, the visuals, everything putting it together to tell a beautiful story. And that was the story of Mr. West's career. It was a very beautiful story, one that spoke about growth, development, and just trying to be the best he could be on every single occasion. I told a story on the Michigan guest earlier this evening where he sent some clips to Peter Jury, football fans didn't know who Peter Jury is, just trying to get some feedback from him as to how he could improve his craft as a commentator. And I remember him calling me and showing me the response from Peter Durie saying to him that his work is fine, his work is excellent. And I think that for me spoke to what Donald was.
