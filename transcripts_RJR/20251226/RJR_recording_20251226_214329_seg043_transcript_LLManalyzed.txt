We'll make me I roll a gal you want tech when we solve every card on the decks every fall on the pleasure where you get when we grow. You're warm like a blanket when we call from your from your beat make it roll out it roll Outfit in your jeans, take it tall You'll not run when it up, we'll take it all Your heart, me no regrets, let me stall Slip up, pose now Touch your toes now Rip, yuck, yuck, down Ah, make it bounce Up, down, up, down, up And make it bounce up, down, down, up. We chillin' on a lissy on me baller. When a man's in love, we're not solo. Life too short, so we all up. She vickin' my box as a parlor.
