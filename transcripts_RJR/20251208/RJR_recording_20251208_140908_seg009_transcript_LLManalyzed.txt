============================================================

Gave you love, you did me wrong Didn't know what to do But baby I'm strong, gonna get over you A new boy I'm gonna choose My love was true, still you threw it all away Now by the gods who have me, you'll appreciate my love. Tell me, how does it feel? You know that I needed you. You know that you meant the world to me You know I had to have you Now I'm gonna find somebody new I'm looking for a new love, baby, a new love
