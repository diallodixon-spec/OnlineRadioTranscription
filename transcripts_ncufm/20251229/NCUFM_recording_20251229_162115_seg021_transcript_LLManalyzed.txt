20251229 162115 You'll be with heaven, you'll see. It's a privilege here to help another. Just to tell if it's love. In all I say, my soul will fly over Chile and Jordan, over Jordan. On winds of love, I'll fly away. Not a moment to lose Make up your mind Take a moment and choose Gods are divine From the moment you're saved How happy you'll be Take a moment and live eternally For heaven is free, how happy you'll be When heaven you'll see All the wind is white out of the water But the sinner will come on me someday
