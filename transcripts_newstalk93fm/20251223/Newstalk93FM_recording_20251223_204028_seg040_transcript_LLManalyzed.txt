Give me one look, and I'll just fart this. Oh no. Oh no. But they say, yeah, take your time when you go down there. You go speak all you want, then end up in a dead. But I ain't afraid, yeah. One piece of that Chup-Chup, darling. So long you've been saving it, non-stop you're like craving it, I want something that chooks you, darling. Treat this when it's rolling, rolling, look back when it rolling, rolling, things nice when they're rolling, rolling, and I love how it's rolling.
