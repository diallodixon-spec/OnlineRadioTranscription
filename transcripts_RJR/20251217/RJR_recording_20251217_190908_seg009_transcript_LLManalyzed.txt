Yeah, because everybody, it seemed like 90% of the people walking around in natural senses would tell you they actually want to be in med school and only a fraction make it. Right. And it was far more competitive then because UWI was the only med school in the Caribbean at that time. So everybody from everywhere came here. And they also took far less students than they do nowadays. Did they have a bad doubt as to whether you would make it? No, I never think about that. I just think that I'm going to work hard and get the grades. But what was interesting was the physics, because I needed the physics. I needed to do the A-level physics. And I couldn't do it. I couldn't do physics at N2, because I never did the O-level physics. So I didn't do O level physics and then I needed to do A level physics to get in. So I decided to buy the A level textbook which was Nelken and Parker. But the problem is that I had to do a practical exam. So where am I going to sit the exam?
