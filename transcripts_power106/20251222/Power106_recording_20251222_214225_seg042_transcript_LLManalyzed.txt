20251222 214225 Take out my drivers like this. I realised an update, so I didn't put the $10,000. I never remember saying I didn't put an update. Never remember saying I took it out of my pocket. So, it's like, I have to say, you know what to say, I'm not going to call or tell Aaron to come on to Christmas, somehow I'll use that now as a halibut if you cut in on the Christmas, yeah? Because you don't know until Christmas the woman, they want bling bling. They want their house set up. They want curtains. They want bedspread. They want gold.
