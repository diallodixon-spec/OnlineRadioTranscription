If Adjust the Truth has done anything over its first year, I hope it has encouraged you to pause, to ask one more question, to check one more source, and to take one more step toward care. Whether that is care for your body, your mind, your community, or your country, the conversations continue, the learning continues, and the work continues. Thank you for reasoning with us. Thank you for trusting this space. And as always, Truth Fam, keep being safe and continue being awesome. Thank you for an awesome year.
