20251223 194955 The world is ever changing, the world is ever changing. But you are still the same. Please order my steps, Lord, I'll pray for you again. Order my steps, in your word. Guide my feet in your word. I need you to wash my heart in your word. Show me how to love in your word, I need to know how to talk. In your word, show me how to walk. Show me how to talk. I want to learn how to talk to you.
