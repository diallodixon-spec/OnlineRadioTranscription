The preceding program was brought to you in time, made available for government broadcasts. You're listening to Sleek Radio, 93 FM. I love the way that you bring a vibe With your hands them up in the sky Rollin' back and havin' a time We in lightning again And we havin' money to spend Yes, we jammin' down to the end
