Crime Stop or Call Crime Stop at 311.

Superintendent of Police Victor Barrett of the Counterterrorism and Organized Crime Investigation Branch CTOC said the police are actively probing incidents and urging the public to report them. He said that the fraudsters are using fear and urgency to manipulate victims into bypassing their better judgment. He's also imploring the public to refrain from engaging with these individuals if they receive such a call. Further to that, they are asking that you actively look into these incidents and ask citizens to report them to the police.
