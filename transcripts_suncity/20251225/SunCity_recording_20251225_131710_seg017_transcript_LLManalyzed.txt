Exactly what is on my mind Seems like everybody's breaking up And throwing their love away But I know I got a good thing right here That's why I say, hey Nobody gonna love me better I'ma stick with you forever Nobody gonna take me higher I'ma stick wit' you You know how to appreciate me I'm a stick wit' you my baby Nobody ever made me feel this way I'm a stick with you
