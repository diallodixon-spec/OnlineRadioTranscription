20251229 101812 Welcome back to A Business We Continue our conversation with Editor Newman, President of the Transport Operators of MSSA Civil Services, talking about the 373 road fatalities and the impact on families, the economy, the transport sector, as well as how to deal with this massive national problem. Welcome back, Mr. Newman. Thank you very much. Yes. So, Mr. Newman, I mean, you and your organization are taking such an active role in this, and you're not even responsible for 5% of these fatalities. So, what is happening? Why aren't we hearing anything? $100 million is nothing compared to the loss of life, the cost to the healthcare sector, you know, people who are disabled, the cost of families. You know, I want to ask Dr. Jones.
