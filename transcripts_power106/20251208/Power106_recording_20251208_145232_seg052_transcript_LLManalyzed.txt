we have been seeing where the applications have been taking a little longer because of the backlog. So the easiest answer, the best answer I can give you is because there is a backlog at the National Land Agency. But I mean, as inconvenient and as frustrating as the waiting period can be, please don't let that deter you from making your title applications. You know, nothing beats having your registered title in your hand. And as I always tell persons, you've had the property for 15, 20, 25, 30 years or more. Waiting another one, two or three years to get the title is nothing compared to all this time that you've had in land without your title. So don't let the wait deter you. Please take steps to get your title applications in. If you haven't started, remember the first step is to get the property surveyed. So contact a surveyor. The survey diagrams themselves are taking a while to be finalized, so contact a surveyor
