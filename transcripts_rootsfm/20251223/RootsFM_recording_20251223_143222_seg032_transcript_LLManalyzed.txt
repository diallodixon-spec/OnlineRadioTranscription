20251223 143222 It's Friday night, and I feel all right. The party's here on the west side, so I reach for my 40 and I turn it up. Designated driver, take the keys to my truck. Hit the shaw cuz I'm faded. Hoodies in the streets, say money, yo, we go it To all my name-mates, you've got much river This is how we feel it. All hands are in the air. And wave them from here to there.
