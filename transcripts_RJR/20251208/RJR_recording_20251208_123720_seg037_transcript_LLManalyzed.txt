have gotten their water supply restored. But we in Aberdeen have not gotten our supply restored. Instead, they have gotten water bills of more than $11,000 sent to us, even though we have not received any water for more than six months. Sir, please help us. We are being robbed right now. I'm being asked to pay $50,000 for water, which I didn't receive. This is how you rob it. Hell, please, thank Aberdeen, and say listen, you're not eating the water, what are you going to do to sort this out? Instead of sending them these bills. Have a heart man.
