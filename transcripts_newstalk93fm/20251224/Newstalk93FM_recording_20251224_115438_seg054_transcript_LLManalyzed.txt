If I broke down my business I like it when it go bright too Fall like a funny night too Life and living are never thanksgiving They don't know it's short and busy The girls don't move for easy Long side Tyler Now the world hot up like fire The way we move, skin on the skin No separation, need no conversation Nah, nah, nah, on everything It's automatic, going several to a hundred Right in wishing the wheels would fall off Time is ticking the clock
