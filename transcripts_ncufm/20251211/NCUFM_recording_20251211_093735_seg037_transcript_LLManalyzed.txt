Be edified by the word of God and accept your special invitation to listen to power in this page. Join me, Liseth Martin, on NCUFM as we read the Holy Bible, one chapter each day, Sunday to Sabbath, 530 a.m., with a repeat at 9.30 p.m. So join me daily for this wonderful experience on NCUFM. Sister Gregor requested this one. Sweet. Sweet. And all I take.
