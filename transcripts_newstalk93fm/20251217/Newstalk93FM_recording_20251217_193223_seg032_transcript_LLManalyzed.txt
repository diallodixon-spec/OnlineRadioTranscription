20251217 193223 and I was moving correct Been running around trying to do the home run Left that girl, she was no fun I tie one, smoke one Big Chief Skeppy and I answer to no one Counting my blessings, I'm feeling special Birds eye view, SK level Give them the shaku when I dance with the devil Young fella Kuti, the return of the rebel I told her I need some space Real busybody, never stay in one place And she knows I got more tricks under my sleeve That's why she never wants me to leave She tell me bad man see I need your love See I need your love Me need you close to me Me tell her save me or stay on the road Bad energy stay far away Make you stay far away Just gimme love for tonight give me love for the night yeah i waste no time
