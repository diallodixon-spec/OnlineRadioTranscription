Cause I wanna take a ride Let me blow your mind Ride it from the passenger's side It like that, yo I got the sweet and the spice and the everything nice It's like that yo I got the hen and the lime with the cream on the side I hate it when you have to leave But I don't say a thing Cause I will absolutely get the ring No worries, no worries Baby, baby, baby, baby I'm to use my expertise. I'm going to keep it nice. I'm gonna keep it neat. I'ma keep it sugar.
