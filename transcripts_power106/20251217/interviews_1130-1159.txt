**Office of Utilities Regulation Explains Recent Electricity Rate Increase**

In a recent interview on Radio Jamaica's "Talk With Substance" program, Director General of the Office of Utilities Regulation (OUR), Anzard Hewitt, and Acting Coordinator of Consumer Affairs Operations, Beverly Green, discussed the recent 7% increase in electricity rates approved by the OUR. The increase has sparked concerns among consumers, particularly in the aftermath of Hurricane Melissa, which caused widespread devastation and disruption to the island's utilities.

According to Hewitt, the OUR's role is to oversee the utilities' preparedness for disasters like Hurricane Melissa, and to ensure that consumer interests are protected. He explained that the recent increase is a result of the higher cost of fuel, particularly heavy fuel oil, which is used by the Jamaica Public Service Company (JPS) and independent power producers (IPPs) to generate electricity.

Hewitt noted that the IPPs have contracts with JPS to sell electricity at a fixed rate, which includes a fuel component and a capital cost component. The fuel component is determined by the price of heavy fuel oil, which has increased significantly due to the hurricane. The capital cost component is fixed and is built into the rate that the IPPs charge JPS.

The Director General explained that the OUR has a formula to determine the fuel rate, which takes into account the price of heavy fuel oil and other factors. He noted that the formula is indexed to the fuel market and is designed to reflect the actual cost of fuel.

Hewitt also explained that the 7% increase approved by the OUR is a phased increase, which will be implemented over the next six months. He noted that the increase is necessary to reflect the higher cost of fuel, but that the OUR is working to minimize the impact on consumers.

When asked about the possibility of JPS storing more heavy fuel oil for emergency situations, Hewitt noted that the company is required to have a certain amount of fuel in storage, but that the use of heavy fuel oil is not the preferred option. He explained that natural gas is a more efficient and cost-effective fuel source, but that it is not always available, particularly during disasters like Hurricane Melissa.

The interview also touched on the issue of transparency and accountability, with Hewitt noting that the OUR is committed to providing clear and timely information to consumers about the factors that affect their electricity bills.

In response to a caller's question about the significant increase in their electricity bill, Hewitt explained that the OUR is available to assist consumers with their concerns and to provide information about their bills. He encouraged consumers to contact the OUR with any questions or concerns they may have.

Overall, the interview provided valuable insight into the factors that affect electricity rates in Jamaica and the role of the OUR in regulating the utilities sector. It also highlighted the challenges faced by the sector in the aftermath of Hurricane Melissa and the need for transparency and accountability in the regulation of utilities.
