I filed for my husband in October 2023. I am a permanent resident. Uh how much longer do we have to wait? Well, the I 130 itself should have been approved already because right now they're actually in 2024. They're processing applications at the NVC stage for green card holders who are filing for spouses from 2024. So they're actually at February 2024. And so since she filed in 2023, it all depends. Has the I-130 already been approved and the file sent over to the National Visa Center? Have your spouse done his police report? Have you submitted your affidavit of support? Have you even become documentally qualified as yet? All right. So if you want further consultation, then you can continue listening. Opal will give her contact
