containers are scheduled to arrive in Falmouth in short order to establish a temporary facility for the Trelawny Infirmary. The facility sustained severe damage from Hurricane Melissa in October, with approximately 60 residents and 40 staff members of the infirmary displaced following the hurricane. The residents are currently being housed at Hague Primary School. Local government and community development minister Desmond McKenzie says the installation of the facility will allow residents and staff to relocate by the end of December. The facilities will not be as the same as what existed before, but it will be a little bit more modern and more cultural because it will be the first time that a facility like the infirmary will be using this node to host the residents. Minister McKenzie was speaking during a recent site visit to the new location for the Chilono Infirmary. That was JIS News. I'm Andre Pamo. A production of the Jamaica Information Service.
