2025-12-12 14:01:20 I like how you do your thing. And may I say to you, you have learned well at, you say you went to Manning? The great Manning School, yes. Yes. You have learned well. And I would say to you this afternoon that you come from good stock. Yes. And if we, if we as Jamaican can emulate, all of us as Jamaican, can emulate these good principles of you and other stalwarts from both political friends who have said good, good leadership qualities, then Jamaica under God will be a better place. Increasing beauty. Thank you so much. And I like how things is going on despite of the warlike hurricane Melissa that have destroyed St. Elizabeth, Westmoreland, Hanover, St. James and a part of Tritonians. I'm talking about the whole of Jamaica. I like what purses are doing from the diaspora and here in Jamaica.
