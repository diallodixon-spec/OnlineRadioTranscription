20251224 194520 Another year is about to close Happy memories filled with those Joy and laughter under mistletoes While kids are sharing toys and clothes Surrounded by the ones I love My favorite place to be Surely feels like Christmas to me I hope you have a Merry Christmas And I hope it grants you all your wishes And all you you dreamed of The King was born this day New blessings on the way So have yourself a Merry Christmas
