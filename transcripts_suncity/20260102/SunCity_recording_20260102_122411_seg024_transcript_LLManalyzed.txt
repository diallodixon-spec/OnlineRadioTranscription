20260102 122411 I guess you wonder where I've been I searched to find a love within It's done up for a day I came back to let you know Gotta think for you And I can't let go My friends wonder what is wrong with me But I'm not dead from your love you see. I came back to let you know, that I live for you, and I can't let go. The party weekend starts now. Some people go around the world for love.
