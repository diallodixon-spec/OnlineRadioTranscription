20251216 092317 When you've done your best And it ain't good enough You can't please mankind Because you're so unjust God understands your pain Don't give up, no way They don't like to see Greatness around They'll do everything To keep you down God feels your pain Don't give up, no way But I'm sorry for the times When I gave up on you I regret every moment When I never worshipped you Lord, I'm sorry for allowing them to steal my joy away. I won't let it happen again. No, no, I won't.
