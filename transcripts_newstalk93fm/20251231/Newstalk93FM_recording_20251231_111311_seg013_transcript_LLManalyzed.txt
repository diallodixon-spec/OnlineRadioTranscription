20251231 111311 I used to sleep on Stagger Coach, I used to sleep in Curry Coach, the man that never left me out, I used to live at Eddie's house, I never keep my own keys, Shaquemah used to let me out, That's true sport. But I have been so fortunate Surrounded by so many people, make sure I say me got pathetic And them the thing me can't forget Your daughter and me daughter, once me leaving, she no happy friend But if I make it in a lie You are gonna believe me like royalty So me and me say the thing alright
