2025-12-12 06:07:51 How to be strong with me is where I belong No one's ever touched me Quite the way you touched me People search a lifetime To find what we have You are the love of my life One thing that's good in this life. I'll spend the rest of my days just loving you. You are love of my life, the heart and soul of my life. Once I was lost and alone, with you at last I am home You give me so much of you
