I'm convinced. Next time you see your mama, tell her how she raised a boy. Out on the pop out. Cause it's hot out. You was playing games. But you on time out. I don't find. Don't try to find. I been cuffed up too long. Let me remind. I ain't see your car. I ain't hear a ring I'm in the studio, call you when I leave Who I'm with? I know you're lying Whereani. It's you and I, baby, I, I, baby.
