We just started my life. Me, I watch, we're eating on my side. I hope you take care of me and mine. No off, no times, and no cross-cast vibe. No, no, it's how weood. I'm just a walk and a move. Gonna make me rock and groove. No, no I'm just homomooood. I'm a just a walk and go through. Gonna make we rock and groove.
