20251216 194537 on board, and we look forward to any sponsorship or assistance that can be preferred. All right, good. The final question, running out of time, in fact, we are out of time here, but Vice President Robinson, Nicole Young, female participation, are you happy with what you are seeing? That's the final question. Tell me, please. I'm not happy, but it's a starting point, because even in in the last tournament the APCA that was held in America up by Jacksonville they request that the next time we come in to bring in youngsters and also female participation so we know it's trying to do that so it's a start and it only can get better from here. Absolutely. Vice President, I'm calling on Robinson and Treasurer, Oren Thompson of the Jamaica Drops Association. Thank you very much, gentlemen, for being here. It's gonna go great. And thank you. And your station again for your coverage. Thank you both. All right.
