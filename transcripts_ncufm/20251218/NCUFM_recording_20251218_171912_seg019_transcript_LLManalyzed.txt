20251218 171912 One day I was in my room and I wasn't feeling you. I said, Father, are you there? I'm feeling real scared. So I got down on my knees as I began to work, hoping that the Lord heard what I had to say I said I started begging, I said Pleading and I got on my knees So as I began to cry, I said, I never left your side. I've been right here all along, so you can dry your eyes. You're seeking me like I knew you would, praising me like you know you could. That's when I realized.
