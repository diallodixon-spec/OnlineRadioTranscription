Moon on your skin Hands round your waist Music is love And I hear a tune I play The way how you moving Got me feeling away Away, away Yeah, bassline Go on, turn it up until you feel it in your spine Excess amount of the style manna bring Boom Boom tune a play girl, balance pan, redeem. Redeem. Redeem. Earth start to shake and the world start to spin. Can't take no break if it upstart again. Well consistent from this you can depend. Pull up quick from your hands. Let me know when you are feeling good.
