20251230 155539 Mr. Big Man, who are your dreams? Dynasty When you come from a certain place Them they show love Come from a certain race Your love Them love when you fall on your face And slow down Needs to travel with faith And hold on No hospital for the sick and the kids don't have no school Them set only fans for the girls and the boys getting cool Mr. Big Man, who are you?
