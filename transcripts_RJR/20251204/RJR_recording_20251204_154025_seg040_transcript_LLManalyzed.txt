You know, I stand up comedians in in one one of the things that we do and we know and say, alright, me I me I put a joke together. Um that joke, I go, I go learn, you know, and sometimes we up there and we say, how do you know like when you when it's when you're in the studio and your master, you say, I don't know. I don't know at all. I never know. This is why when you will hear some artists say, they're going to they're going to intend to make a hit song, I never make a hit song for my band. I make a song and the audience determines whether it hits or not. If you ever try to venture down that path, first of all, it's a futile journey. And when I work with you, I work with you. And when I don't work with you, then don't. Some artists come out and make fool, fool song, and they're my biggest thing. And then they grow up mature and make some of the baddest song them. Nobody cares. You have some artists that the producers say they're going to release the song and they say no.
