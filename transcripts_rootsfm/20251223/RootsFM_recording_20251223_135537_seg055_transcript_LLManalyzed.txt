20251223 135537 all the callers, all the listeners, all the participants. This has been Rootsology, your first edutainment classroom on air anywhere in the hemisphere. Been with your C.G. Yorker giver, Denise Isis Isis Isis Miller, some say Impressional, some say Princess, some say Queen, some even say Rootsologist. I mean, I'm healing up all my lions and my lionesses in the concrete jungle because only the fittest of the fittest will survive in this time, you know? Mentally, physically, spiritually, emotionally, musically, and magically, and... On this here, we call this... We call this... 23rd day of December 2025. Choose yourself first, that's where the king and the queen reside. Huck up yourself, love up yourself, bless up yourself. Bless your conscience and start badmouthing your country.
