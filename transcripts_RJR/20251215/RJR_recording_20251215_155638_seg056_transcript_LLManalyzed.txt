Well, you know, many of us may have not been in the situation where we lose so many things, but I just have a heart for the people. And even though it looks bad, God is still good. And I want people to understand that he is still good and he has not forgotten you and you are going to build back stronger. Just be hopeful knowing that you you're going to build back strong. Take heart draw closer to god in this season because truly people of god when it's all said and done we're in the end times times are drawing closer and we need to look to Jesus. So let this not just be a distraction But let this let this let us let us make changes, you know We see our father draw closer to him and be so much grateful because we realize that the rich can be affected and the poor can be affected So who's who's the most important thing right?
