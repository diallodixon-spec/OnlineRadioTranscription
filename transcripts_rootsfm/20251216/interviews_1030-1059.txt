**Kingston Creative Art Walk Festival: A Celebration of Resilience and Community**

In the aftermath of a devastating cat five hurricane, the Kingston Creative Art Walk Festival is set to take place on December 21, bringing together artists, artisans, and the community to celebrate resilience and creativity. The festival, which will feature a grand market edition, will be held on Church Street and Water Lane in downtown Kingston, with a range of activities, including live performances, a free walking tour, and a hop-on hop-off bus tour.

Andrea Dempster Chung, co-founder and executive director of Kingston Creative, spoke to Roots FM about the festival and the importance of supporting local creatives. "We think it's really important to be intentional about who we are spending our money with this Christmas, to ensure that we are supporting Jamaican creatives, hiring Jamaican creatives, and gifting things from Jamaican creatives at every opportunity," she said.

The festival will feature a range of local artisans, including those from West Milan and Treasure Beach, as well as performances by Grammy-nominated singer Mortimer, Tivoli Dance Troupe, and the Southern Strikers Marching Band. The event is sponsored by the Jamaica Tourist Board, the Tourism Enhancement Fund, and other local businesses.

In addition to the festival, Kingston Creative has also established a Creative Resilience Fund to support creatives who have been affected by the hurricane. The fund, which has received donations from the Miami Foundation and an anonymous donor, will provide grants of $30,000 to support creatives in rebuilding their livelihoods.

"We realized that we would have to have some kind of support grant for creatives, because we have seen during COVID what happens to creatives when you have an external shock like this," Dempster Chung explained. "It takes a very long time for this sector to get back, and we want to make sure that we are supporting them in a meaningful way."

The festival and the Creative Resilience Fund are part of a broader effort to promote cultural tourism and support the creative economy in Jamaica. As Dempster Chung noted, "We need to make sure that some funds and some awareness are also directed towards the creative sector, because they are also entrepreneurs, and they are also contributing to the economy."

The Kingston Creative Art Walk Festival is a testament to the resilience and creativity of the Jamaican community, and a celebration of the power of art and culture to bring people together and support economic development. As Dempster Chung said, "We're really excited to have this event, and we're looking forward to a great day of music, art, and community."
