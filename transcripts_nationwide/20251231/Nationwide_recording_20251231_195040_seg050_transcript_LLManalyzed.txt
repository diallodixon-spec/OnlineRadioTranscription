20251231 195040 We're late, with you, I could stay there Close my eyes, will you hear? Forever, you and me together Nothing gets better, cause there's a side to you that I never knew, never knew All the things you'd say, they were never true, never true And the games you'd play, you're always weird But I'll set fire to the rain Watch it pour as I touch your face Wait and burn while I cry Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name
