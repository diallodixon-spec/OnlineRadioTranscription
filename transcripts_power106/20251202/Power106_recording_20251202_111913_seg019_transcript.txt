The Office of Disaster Preparedness and Emergency Management, that's ADPEM, is seeking to assure the public that its National Emergency Operations Center remains activated in the event of an earthquake. It follows a 3.1 magnitude quake recorded in sections of St. Elizabeth. Early Monday morning, that's yesterday morning, the epicenter was located near Goshen, which is about with a depth of 10 kilometers. Oh, that's pretty deep. It's reported that the earthquake was felt in Santa Cruz. Atpen is telling people to rest assured. You don't look so confident.
