20251231 210908 I pray for your wisdom, O God, and a heart that's sincere. Lord, I lift my friend up to You. Lord I lift my friend to You You My best friend in the world I know He means much more to You I want so much to help Him But this is something He has to do Lord, I lift my friend up to you. Cause there's a way that seems so right to him. But you know where that leads. He's becoming a puppet of the world.
