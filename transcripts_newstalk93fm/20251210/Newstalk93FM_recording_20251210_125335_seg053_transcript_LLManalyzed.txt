Just get in the drop top, take the head out, don't cruise with your head outside. Go ahead, it's your time baby. It's your time baby, get my baby. That's the difference when you're my baby, that's how it is when you. Nobody make me stop the world. Tell me what do we do when these people don't know what you been through? You survive through the night, through the darkest of times. It's only right that you do what you like. I can't help you, don't anybody ever hate it hated Put you in baguettes, got you feeling like you made it Everything advanced, nothing that I do is basic Me and Rose Royce on a first name basis Look her with no chases Only give her hunnits cause she hates seeing new faces Know she want her mind by the stones in her bracelet
