20251219 180001 that you were making a point about that progressive decline that, you know, it's not addressed. So there will be something there. Yes. Yeah. And we do recognize that traumatic events can impact your mental well-being and it can also reduce your resilience, your ability to deal with future traumatic situations. And we do realize that there needs to be support into monitoring and there needs to be access where if there's an emergency we can act quickly and prevent any catastrophes or tragedies as we see in this case. So it's important to recognize that we have to, one, be knowledgeable of what exists in terms of the systems that are in place, and also be aware of ways that we can improve on these systems and expand the reach, expand the impact that they have in the community and even as community members to learn to work collaboratively so that we can ease access because that's where the critical thing is. It's cutting down the access time that persons can respond to persons in need because a few minutes can make a difference as we see in this case. Thank you Dr. Walcott. Thank you Mr. Maraj. We are out of time. We are on top of the news. Thank you so much.
