20251219 191614 Relax and take it easy. Cause you give me hope, hope. You're like the morning sun, and I'm not alone. You give me hope. Hope. You're like a sunrise. No, I'm not afraid. Cause you'll give me hope when I walk on sinking sand. Feeling lonely in a crowd. When everything's pulling me in every direction. You're my anchor. You're my solid ground. All I'm searching for, I find. You're medicine for my mind. You give me hope.
