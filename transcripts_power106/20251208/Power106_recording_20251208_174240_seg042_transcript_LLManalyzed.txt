Lost touch with my soul I had nowhere to turn I had nowhere to go Lost sight of my dream Thought it would be the end of me I thought I'd never make it through. I had no hope to hold on to. I thought I would break. I didn't know my own strength. And I crashed down. And I tumbled. But I did not crumble. I got through all the pain I didn't know my own strength Survived my darkest hour, my faith kept me alive I picked myself back up, hold my head up high
