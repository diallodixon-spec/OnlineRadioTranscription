============================================================

We just had Black Friday and Cyber Monday. We want persons to be aware that in a disaster, Cash is king and most vendors are likely to depend, not to depend on the digital transfer. Connectivity is unstable in some areas, so we don't want you going to hotspots to do banking transactions and so on. But we just want persons to bear in mind that this is normally the season for hacking and phishing and all the activities engaging online to get you to give up information so they can get into your financial, your banking information. So we just want consumers to be very sensitive to that. It's pre-Christmas, it's heightened time of year online, and this is when most of the hacking occurs. So be very careful where you insert your banking information. Borrow devices, hotspots, those are not recommended.
