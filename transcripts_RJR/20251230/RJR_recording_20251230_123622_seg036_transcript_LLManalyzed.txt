20251230 123622 and there was no balance? No, it doesn't show the balance because I have the first ticket and it doesn't show balance I know that there was an issue about that not sure if they had resolved it where for instance you would persons of late were not seeing their balances I think there was a change over the machine some time ago so I hadn't heard anything further so so soon that they had reconciled that or fixed it you know but um it should and it's so helpful why would you not want to do because you want to go by guesswork you know what I mean But when I put on 105, and I know I don't take JVTC all the while, my 105 doesn't have no time. So when I asked the driver to check my ticket, my smart card, it was $310.
