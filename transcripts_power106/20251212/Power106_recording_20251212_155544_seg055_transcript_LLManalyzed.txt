If there is any area that is still unrepaired, please take the photos or do the recording and submit it to us. Also, as much as you can, take reasonable steps to prevent further damage. So if windows were broken, cover those broken windows up. If you lost your roof or portions of your roof, cover the affected areas with tarpaulin, for example. Also, keep your receipts for your emergency repairs that you might have done or as I mentioned before, if you had to seek alternative accommodation and you're now incurring rent, keep those receipts, submit those to us. All or perhaps a part of it may be covered under your homeowners' policy. And most importantly, you need to let us know that you suffered a lot. Report it to us within 60 days, which should take us to about December 28th as the cutoff for the deadline
