20260102 190104 The theme this year, it means that whatever you do, you must aim for excellence. You can never stop. You continue to grow and you continue to grow. So it's at a final destination. It's an onward trajectory movement for excellence. These awards are geared towards showcasing excellence in our schools and showing appreciation for the hard work of our school leaders and workers within the schools. It is also geared towards highlighting the PEP students who have performed well in their examinations. So as a committee, Friends, we do this annually and this is our 19th staging in awarding excellence to hard work. Friends of Region 6 was established to support educational institutions within the Ministry of Education, Skills, Youth and Information's Region 6, which covers St Catherine and parts of Clarendon. It does so through student and teachers awards, relief efforts, food and supply assistance and counselling services, among others.
