============================================================

Yes, it should. No, I can't forget tomorrow when I think of all my sorrows. When I had you there, but then I let you go. And now it's only fair that I should let you know. Love is perfect. I can't live, if living is without you. I can't give, I can't give anymore. I can't live if living without you.
