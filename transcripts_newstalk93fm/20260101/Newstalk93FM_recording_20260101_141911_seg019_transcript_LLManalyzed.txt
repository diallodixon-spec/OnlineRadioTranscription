20260101 141911 I know I'm cute and funny. I know somebody want me. I might go sell a bit. I know I make some money outside. Love her outside. But be sick when that girl's got some outside honey. Bathing suit, body suit. Trying to let this body loose. This tequila 90 proof. Chasing with my juice. Heard them pictures got them f**ks Let me in that locker room And some ladies siding beggars Asia, we was popping boo Booty cheeks, got a shake, vertical Got some pay, let me know the time and place I'm just tryna ride this f**k PJKK Take me somewhere tropical Spidey, find my shoes Uber driver, kinda cute When I tell you these f**ks ain't shit Please believe it, they gon' f**k' on anything, these way too easy. Good for nothing, load on dirty dogs, I'm convinced. Next time you see your mama, tell her how she raised a boy. Out on the pop out, cause it's hot out. You was playing games, but you on time out.
