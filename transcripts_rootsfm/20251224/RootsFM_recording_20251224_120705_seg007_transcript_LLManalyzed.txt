I know that like me there are many who cares but you care the more oh lord about the poor and you would want to do everything through us to make a difference in the lives of these people. Those who have monetary donations, that can go a long way in helping those who are suffering and not able to provide for themselves. But we're also praying for those who are really, really, really hungry and is in need for their hunger to be filled. Father, I pray that as I seek your face.
