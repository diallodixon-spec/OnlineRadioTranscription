20251215 143325 Leave me all the way Don't ask for all your things back Cussing out my name, yeah Just to go and take back what you say Burn all the bridges Don't ask for forgiveness Walk away like I'm someone you hate Don't let me down easy If you're gonna leave me, baby Go and leave me all the way everybody's so punk on the internet everyone's unbothered till they're not every joke's just trolling and memes Sad as it seems, apathy is hot Everybody's cut throat in the comments Every single heartache is cold as ice When you found me I said I was busy, that was a lie
