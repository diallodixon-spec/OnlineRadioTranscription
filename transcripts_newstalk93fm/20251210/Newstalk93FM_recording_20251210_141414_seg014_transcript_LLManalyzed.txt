I'm going to add a little bit of color to my hair. I'm going to use a little bit of pink to make my hair stand out a little bit. I'm using a little bit of red to make it stand out. I'm also going to add a bit of pink to my hair, the way I make you laugh The way we like to share a walk in Central Park I could be fresh air, might be the girl of your dreams There's no need to hide if you're into me Cause I'm into you quite intimately And maybe one I could turn into three Well, I'm down to six I make it so easy to fall in love So come give me a call And we'll fall into us On the perfect mix
