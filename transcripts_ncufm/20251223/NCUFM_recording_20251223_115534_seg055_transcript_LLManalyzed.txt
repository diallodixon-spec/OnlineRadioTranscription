20251223 115534 Longer fall Oh, the world's always longer fall Sometimes, rains are gonna come. Clouds will gather on the horizon. Blue will fade from the sky above. Sometimes, plans will be disrupted. Life will take a turn. Hope will seem less than wishful thinking. Sometimes bad news will arrive, and we will weep, and we will wonder. Sometimes we'll get angry. We'll shout with the question, why? And in those sometimes, God is here.
