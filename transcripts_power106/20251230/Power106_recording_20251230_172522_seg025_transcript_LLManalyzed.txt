20251230 172522 breakthrough is its two-motor hybrid system, which works unlike most competitors. In typical hybrids, the gasoline engine does most of the work and electric power just assists. Honda flipped that logic. In the CR-V hybrid, electric motors are the primary drive, while the engine mostly acts as a generator. Honda calls this setup an ECVT, and it's one of the smartest drivetrain designs in modern SUVs. At low speeds, the wheels are driven directly by electric motors, delivering instant torque and smooth acceleration. The engine only connects mechanically at highway speeds, where it's most efficient. The payoff is impressive, around 40 miles per gallon combined in a roomy five-passenger SUV. The catch? The hybrid costs about $3,000 more than the gas version. Dealers often steer buyers away from it because hybrids need less maintenance, which means fewer service profits. Honda's hybrid batteries have an excellent long-term
