Every day we're helping out more communities, people who still do not have electricity. We're talking, it's going to be two months since Hurricane Melissa. And this event is going to continue to support people with essential needs. And most important, we're working, we're working that it should be a long-term effect. We want to help people, social workers, and we're doing this through the power of music. So we're going to get together, we're going to light candles for those who lost their lives in the hurricane, and we're going to pray for those who are wounded and lost all their properties.
