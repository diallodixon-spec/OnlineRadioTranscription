20251230 190003 when I was wondering what were some of those strategic deficiencies and how did you go about addressing them sufficient that the EU could say okay we can be removed from this list. Mr. Smith? No. Seems we lost him. We're talking to Courtney Smith. He is the General Counsel and Senior Director of Legal Services at the Financial Investigations Division. Some good news coming in for Jamaica. The country is no longer considered a high-risk jurisdiction for money laundering and financing terrorism by the, that is coming from the European Union. The European Commission list of jurisdiction was released recently. And you know, Ricardo, some stakeholders have previously argued that Caribbean countries including Jamaica have been held to a higher compliance standards than larger jurisdictions and I wanted to hear Mr. Smith on that one because many individuals have said that's the case. We were not treated the same as the larger jurisdictions. And it's interesting you say that Sanjay because I don't think it's only a matter of the prominence of the country or the economy, but also there's been a racial argument that's been raised.
