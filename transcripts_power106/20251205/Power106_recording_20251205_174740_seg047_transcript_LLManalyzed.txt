============================================================

We're walking in a world of wonderland In the meadow we will build a snowman And we'll pretend that he is far surprised He'll say I am married, we'll say no man But you can do the job when you're in town Later on, we'll conspire As we grove by the fire To face unafraid Lands that we've made Walking in a way to wonderland In the meadow we can build a snowman He'll pretend that he is Parson Brown He'll say are you married? We'll say no man But you can do the job when you're in town
