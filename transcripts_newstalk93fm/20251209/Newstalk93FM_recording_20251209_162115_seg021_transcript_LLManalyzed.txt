The eldest daughter of a nobleman Ophelia lived in fantasy The love was a cold bed full of scorpions The venom stole her sanity And if you'd never come for me I might have lingered in purgatory You wrap around me like a chain A crown of fire Oh Now I can see it all. They won. Now you took me out of my grave and saved my heart from the fate of Ophelia. I'll keep you 100 on the land. The sea, the sky, pledge allegiance to your hand.
