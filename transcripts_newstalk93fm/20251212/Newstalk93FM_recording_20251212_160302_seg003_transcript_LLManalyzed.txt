20251212 160302 I just want you to come and ride it up Just a little ride there now Come and meet me at the end of the truck and we rev it up Say hold it, keep throwing it back I know why you stopped us up Baby no way, we could pose up all the pictures you want When you're ready, I go over here Darling, you go over here But we could meet in the middle and start a bacchanal Play in the middle, hey What we gonna do now? Jam to a rhythm, heat a carnival. What we gonna do? Start a wine on it. I say compromise on it. Baby, spend time on it. I said compromise on it, baby, spend time on it. I say compromise on it. Oh, baby.
