and affiliated organizations. Today, I'm going to be speaking with an organization that continues to pour into other people through credit unions. And I'm talking of none other than Kuna Caribbean Insurance Jamaica Limited. Before I begin the discussion, though, let me once again, on behalf of the credit unions of Jamaica, extend heartfelt sympathy to all the people of Jamaica who continue to feel the after effects of Hurricane Melissa. Thank you for joining me today, Mrs. Georgia Morrison. And of course, Georgia is no stranger to the credit union vibes. She is the Assistant Vice President of Sales, Kuna Caribbean. Welcome, Georgia. Thank you so much, Katrina. It's my pleasure to be here with you today. Great. I want to talk to you, Georgia, about KUNA's involvement in outreach activities that were undertaken by the Credit Unions of Jamaica two weekends ago. So, as you know, KUNA Caribbean Insurance, we are strategic partners of the credit unions of Jamaica.
