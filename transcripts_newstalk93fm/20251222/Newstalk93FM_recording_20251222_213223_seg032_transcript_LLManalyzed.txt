20251222 213223 I go take the play I just want you come and rise it up Just a little winding out Come and meet me behind the truck and we rev it up Say full day, keep throwing it back I know why you stop baby no way We got most of all the pictures you want When you're ready I could overshshare, darling. You could overdo it. But we could meet in the middle and start a bacchanal. Play in the middle, hey. What we gonna do now? Jam to a rhythm, yeah. We could eat a carnival. But we could eat it as a compromisement. Ooh, yeah.
