20251229 152819 Black people are rising, it starts well up. Black people blood the wicked man been drinking. Corruptions they masters been thinking. Anyhow I saw them ships sinking. Black people they been lynching and wrenching. For too long the poor man they been suffering. They made the king of kings what joy it brings. Make a juggling, a hustling, no troubling. Out of life, we make all the living. So bless up. Don't get mad, mine and jealous. Bless up. In a Zion, I saw a sea of dwellings. Bless up. Heads up. It's time for you to step up, because when you fall, you're going to ruin everyone every man yard with some up. Living in your own, you got to act cool for real. Stop the youth from killing and you stop them from stealing. Teach them to make a daily living and not really be ill. Who can hear them have a feel? Rastafari!
