20251212 214423 Who could say to him, what are you doing? God will not turn back his anger. Beneath him the helpers of Rahab bow. How much less can I myself answer him? How can I choose my words with him whom I cannot answer even though I am righteous? From my judge I must implore grace. If I summon him and he should answer me, I do not believe that he will listen to my voice, who crushes me with a tempest and multiplies my wounds without cause. He will not allow me to catch my breath. Rather, he will fill me with bitterness. If it is a matter of strength, look, he is mighty. But if it is a matter justice, who can summon me? Even though I am righteous, my mouth will condemn me. Even though I am blameless, yet it would pronounce me guilty. I'm blameless. I do not care about myself. I loath my life. It is all one. Therefore I say, he destroys both the blameless and the wicked.
