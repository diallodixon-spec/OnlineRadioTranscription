20251230 121110 that there is no redress for certain things. So just say a prayer that the people will hold each other together. Say a prayer for yourself. Thank you for all the prayers that you have been putting in over the months. Well, we have reached that milestone where we are rolling over into a new year. So just a prayer that when the new year comes, a little blessing will fall on everybody's head. And just say a prayer for the Mustard Seed family, the What's Up family, Isis Miller, that lovely queen, that strong black woman, say a prayer for her, and say a prayer for all the rest of black women out there that is listening, Marvel, Marvelous, Angie, the whole entourage. Just say a prayer to all the strong men, Brother Dwight, Irving, just a prayer for all of the man them work out there and the behind them family. Their prayer that the new year will find us reunite and uniting together and unity, strength and oneness. Just a prayer.
