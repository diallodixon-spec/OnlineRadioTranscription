We could look at Minister of Justice Delroy. We could look at Desmond McKenzie, Minister Grange and also the Minister of National Security, Horace Chang. So could we see one of those asked to step aside and somebody whether from academia or from the private sector, being recruited and basically put there. And I deliberately go outside of what we are seeing within the Senate and indeed the lower house, because one could probably would say, so what about not asking a Duncan, Keith Duncan, to basically take a seat and you put him there. But again, I personally don't see Keith Duncan as a steady pair of hands for that, for that ministry of finance board. Let me suggest, let me suggest something to you. Go ahead. You don't have to be adept in finance to lead the ministry.
