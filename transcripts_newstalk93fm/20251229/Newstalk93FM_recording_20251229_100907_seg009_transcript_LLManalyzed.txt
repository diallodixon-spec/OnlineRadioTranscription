20251229 100907 I just need some solitude. It's not too much to ask. It needs a man. That's just all I need to find. Oh, gosh. I ain't in the mood. I just need some solitude. In's come the ting call. We'll drop them on the I-10 in Wally. Big sona. Batona. Big sona, batona. Sting! When my son play the big tunes, light is in the air. Vibes up in the street And that's just how it feels When reggae music plays Can't help but move your feet
