20260102 091715 I was just kidding around when I said you know later so if there's anything planned I guess I don't know but yeah and also I'm seeing in the YouTube chat here from Ines Campbell Murray Ines Campbell Murray is saying we are sending get well to Dwight Bono who is one of our loyal listeners at Nationwide, part of the Jamaican diaspora living in New York. He is in the hospital in New York so we are praying for healing for Dwight Bono and we hope that whatever he is going through right now that he will get through it and be out of the hospital in good health. So sending healing your way, Dwight Bonner, praying that you get out of this well. All right, we're going back to the phone lines now. Wesley, good morning. Happy New Year to you.
