Today is Thursday, December 11. I'm Pastor Robert Wright. Thank you again for joining us as we continue God's Word, to study God's Word together. Yesterday's study was really eye-opening. The Western tribes were elated when they realized that the building of an altar was not to set up a new system of worship over there in the West or in the East, but to identify themselves as one with the Western tribes. So today we're going to be looking at conflict resolution. Thank you Heavenly Father. Your word has all the answers we need in our in life, all the principles for godly living. May we spend time studying Your Word and living according to its precepts. And we thank You in Jesus' name. So, Joshua 22, verses 30 to 35.
