20251224 143429 I lost on the road already Tell them that you soaked my hand I'm not coming home tonight I'm not going home tonight Don't sign me backseat Girl, don't send no search party to find me I'm not coming by the melodies Now the liquor take all of me And the bass knock my soul out And my chest so calm won't let me leave I don't know if I'll survive Song after song, wine after wine I go sing strong for life. Weak like the masses crimp tonight. You can't find me, we're bound for shaking. Higher meeting, people fighting. Soca playing, if they want it, no. Tell them you can't find me out on the road. I'm ready to walk, chest up, walk. Time to free up.
