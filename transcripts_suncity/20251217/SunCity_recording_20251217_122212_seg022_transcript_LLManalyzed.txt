20251217 122212 Don't be careful. Don't make me cry. I don't want to hold my baby or wipe the tears from my eyes. Make me a proud mother. Let me see you grow to be a man. This is all I ask of you. I hope you understand. Talk to your songs, talk to them, reason with them. Oh, from my oldest to my youngest, I love you all. So all I ask of you is please stand tall. Stand tall.
