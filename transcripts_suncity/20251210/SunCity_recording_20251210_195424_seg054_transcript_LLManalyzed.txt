Do I need park locked in? That is how we turn on the sun And let our love surround To start that change And seek out our love life With the eyes of a child Dying in And I know we're in some way, somehow What more can we beg? Hold on almost a little longer. Try living. He's working away. Try living, he's working away. I'm in my misery, on my baby knees, when I beg and plead on. The most dying day when I go, yeah, yeah, yeah. Can't you see, I've got love with the eyes of a star?
