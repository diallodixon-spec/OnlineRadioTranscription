============================================================

Some boys kiss me, some boys hug me I think they're okay If they don't give me proper credit I just walk away They can beg and they can bleed But they can't see the light Cause the boy with the cold hard cash is always Mr. Right. Cause we are living in a material world. And I am a material girl. You know that we are Living in a material world And I a material girl. Some boys roam and some boys know that that's all right with me. If they can't raise my interest, then I have to let them.
