I went down to Digicel and asked them what is the issue? They said they were going to sell airflow. No, man, Digicel. I went down to the Digicel building there where it is. Oh, you are having the same issue, but you are having it with Digicel? Yes. No, ma'am. It's been like that for a long time now because I've been dealing with them for 15 years and I paid one round corner so I cut them off totally. So I'm on Dig what is happening. Nobody was able to go through with you when you went to the digital store.
