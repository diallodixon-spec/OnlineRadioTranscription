20260102 214326 Why are you going away? I want to know why are you going away. Why do you want to break my heart? Why are we going away? Why you want to bring my heart? Why? Why oh why? Why baby? Why? What happened? Tell me We can talk I knew that our love was meant to be Oh baby But now you're turning your back on me Seems to me your love is fading away Cause for me you're going farther each day I wanna know, why are you going away? And why you wanna break my heart? Why are you going away
