2025-12-11 22:52:46 Christmas gift. Let me take this call. Hello. Hello, Pastor. Good night. And how you doing? Yes, I was listening on the radio saying if whatever you need for Christmas gift, you could call him and ask. Who said that? Hello? Yes, who? Who said whatever you need for Christmas you can't call? If you need something for Christmas. Doctor, that I heard on the radio, I don't know. When did you hear that? Just now I was listening to the radio. Lord have mercy. I'm sure you didn't hear that from me. Okay, well maybe I don't now. No, no, no.
