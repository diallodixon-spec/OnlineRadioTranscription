He knew at the other end, England didn't have a lion. They didn't have someone who could give them control. He knew England didn't have Stokes. Stokes struggling with his body, maybe a bit of a tweak in his groin, whatever it might be. So he knew that there were going to be freebies on offer. England would tire again because they're batting again, have got their bowlers out in the field. He knows this is a quick scoring ground. He knows it's a short boundary square square where does he love to get his runs it was quite brilliant but I think Kerry also just played that role where calm down if we're here at the end tonight that's pretty close to sealing the deal the voice they're not so seen no champions will be crowned
