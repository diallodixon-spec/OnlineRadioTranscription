20251231 113732 Mr. Humes, many in government and even in cabinet. I don't know about that. He's suggesting that people in cabinet and in parliament are accused of rape. I have no evidence of that. Are those people going to be shot and killed by the police for this allegation or killing is just for the poor small man? What evidence do you have of this? because the alleged rapist was shot and killed for apparently wielding a machete in the direction of the police officers. I'm not so sure that that might have been necessary. I would have preferred to have seen him in court.
