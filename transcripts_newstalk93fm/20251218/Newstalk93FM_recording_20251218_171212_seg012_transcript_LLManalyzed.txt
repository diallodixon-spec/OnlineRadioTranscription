And you don't try to stop me vibe, so don't say You do what you want, I do what I like You ain't have to get no shame When it comes to party, I ain't such a man And I know when we come to party, we don't have a beat You don't tell me why I don't want you Why I don't know you like me? We doing's done Come and do your work, come and do your work Why not do your life, why not know your life? Like yourself, like yourself, like yourself. Until we party time. Jamalouya want, jamalouya want. Why not know you life? Why not know you like? Like yourself, I like it. Like yourself, like it, like yourself, until we party time.
