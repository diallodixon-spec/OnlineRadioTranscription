20251224 123822 The donation was made by a United States-based medical apparel company, Rep Scrubs, in partnership with the Jamaican charity, Sarah's Children. The items were officially handed over during a brief ceremony at the hospital earlier this month. Hospital officials say the scrubs will help to improve safety and efficiency in operating theaters, while also reducing the cost associated with laundering reusable gear after each procedure. The donation comes at a critical time as medical staff continue to manage increased demands following Hurricane Melissa, which caused the damage to several hospitals in Western Jamaica, including Cornwall Regional. Representatives of Sarah's children say the donation was made possible through support from overseas partners who responded quickly after learning of the pressures facing the local health system. Hospital administrators have expressed appreciation for the support, noting that the supplies are expected to last for several months.
