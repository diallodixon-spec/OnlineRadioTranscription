20251223 151720 You can wait your whole life wondering When the storm will come or where we'll stand You may have got your heart broken a few times In the past, you're never as strong as you used to And don't feel as good as you used to before And all the things you used to say, things you used to do Went right out the door Ooh, no more will you be the one That's what you tell everyone around you But you know they've heard it all before What more can you say? When love won't let you walk away And you can't help who you love And you find yourself giving it all away When you think you're enough, ooh I wanna be the one who you believe in Your heart is so proud I don't wanna go another day
