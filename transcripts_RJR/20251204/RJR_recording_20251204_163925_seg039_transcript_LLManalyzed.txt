Ain't no meaning of saying goodbye. Oh, no, no. Ain't no meanin' of saying goodbye to me, goodbye to me, bye to me. Ain't no a minute of saying goodbye, oh, no, no, ain't no a minute saying goodbye,, bye to me, bye, to me You want my heart and everything I dreamt of, okay, darling Never do nothing to ever broke your heart I say people, they try just to keep us apart But let us show them that this love will never end Cause ain't no meaning of saying goodbye Ain't no meaning no saying goodbye
