**Interview with Ricardo and Cliff on Education System in Jamaica**

In a recent radio program, hosts Ricardo and Cliff engaged in a discussion on the state of Jamaica's education system. The conversation centered around the performance of students and the role of teachers in the system. Ricardo emphasized that teachers are the single most important variable in student performance, stating, "If all the other variables are constant, then teachers are the single most important variable in the student performance."

Cliff countered that not all variables are constant in the education system and that people often misdiagnose the problem and prescribe the wrong solution. He argued that the issue lies in the systems of leadership, management, and accountability in schools, as well as the role of parenting.

The discussion also touched on the topic of rewarding teachers based on their performance in the classroom. Cliff suggested that there are too many "freeloaders" pretending to be teachers in the system and that poor leaders and poor leadership in several schools are to blame for the lack of accountability.

Ricardo pointed out that the education system has been like a conveyor belt, where students are promoted to the next grade regardless of their literacy and numeracy levels. He emphasized the need to fix early childhood education and primary education, stating, "If you fix early childhood and primary education, the high school will take care of itself."

The conversation also highlighted the importance of accountability and leadership in the education system. Cliff noted that politics plays too much of a role in determining who sits on school boards and that the quality of individuals on these boards is crucial in shaping the vision and direction of schools.

**Interview with Principal of Yalas High School on School's Performance**

In a separate segment, the principal of Yalas High School was interviewed about the school's performance. The principal rejected the view that the school is underperforming, citing improvements in CSEC passes and City and Guilds passes. He attributed the school's success to the hard work of teachers and students, as well as the implementation of new programs and initiatives.

When asked about the school's performance in math, the principal acknowledged that it was an area that needed improvement. However, he noted that the school's passes in math were in line with the national average.

The principal also discussed the school's plans to turn around its performance, including the implementation of new teaching methods and the provision of additional support to students. He emphasized the importance of data-driven decision making and the need to track student progress closely.

Overall, the interviews highlighted the complexities and challenges facing Jamaica's education system. The discussions emphasized the need for accountability, effective leadership, and a focus on early childhood and primary education to improve student outcomes.
