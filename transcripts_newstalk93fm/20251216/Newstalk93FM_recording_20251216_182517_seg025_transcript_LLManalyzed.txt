20251216 182517 I said five in the morning, I wake up to five of my yearnings Fear in my mind is a warning, pray to the one you're relying I've been wandering all day i tried to be fine but i can't bear the noise in my mind wouldn't leave me i tried to get by but i'm burning and behind my mind it runs all these thoughts stop traveling fighting to give up i've been fighting to be on my lane mind, running to the other side When it's time to leave my life, then it tries to take me out Tell you what I need, riot I really need, I really need time, I really need I need a free mind
