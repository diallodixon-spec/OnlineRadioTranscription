I feel the love I pull on me My heart is aching Call on me, call on me Baby girl I want you Love and life ain't meant the same We were young and playing games I fell in love the first time I saw you And I don't ever worry cause I know I can call you, yeah Even when I'm a thousand miles away In my mind I see your pretty face
