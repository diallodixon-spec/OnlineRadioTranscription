All right, so Nikisha says more love to her mommy, Lorna, over there in Greater Portmore. More blessings and prosperity. And Marcia in New York City says, Happy New Year when it comes, Ali Pachi. Yes, I'm tuned in also. All right, Marcia. Big up yourself, Zin. Yeah, manana. A blessed and prosperous New Year to you too when it comes. All right Marcia?
