20251226 134123 Same way. So one day at a time. Same way. So when I'm looking at my house and I'm saying, but this is cleaning, it can never be finished. And somebody said daily, I just take on one room at a time. If you do one room at the time. Yeah. And you know, they're on a timetable. Right. Right. I always laugh when people say I'm not running a hotel. It's me one day at my house. So if I take on one room a time, it will all be finished eventually. You know, you know where I think that comes from when you were young and you know when mommy go and come check first see what's the progress and say, Look how I'm not going to plant my nice, nice flowers. They're not, but I'm giving myself grace. I'm not beating myself up and saying, Oh my gosh, I failed or whatever. You know what? It's a take it easy Christmas.
