some people have resorted to illegal dumping. And Mayor Vernon has issued an appeal for patients from residents of St. James for the restoration of electricity. The mayor says he was informed that some communities should have electricity restored in two to three weeks, but a significant number will not have power until January. He says the damage across the parish is extensive. It is a tough ask. It has been lengthy. It has been frustrating for many. But rest assured that the extent of the damage experience is not a normal one. And the team is doing as best as possible to ensure that electricity is restored to each and every customer that they have. And to date we are at 55 percent, a little bit over a month later and I trust that by next week we'll be trending into the 60 percent. Chairman of the St. James Municipal Corporation and Mayor of Montague Bay, Richard Vernon.
