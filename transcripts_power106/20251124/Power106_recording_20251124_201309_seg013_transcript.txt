============================================================

that light the world this year is a little bit different. We are in the aftermath of a devastating hurricane. We recognize that across Jamaica, especially in the West, there are many persons who might not feel the light right now. Of course, some persons literally don't have any light, but they also don't feel any light. There is no hope there. We hope and our aim is that we will provide that light for our brothers or sisters or families all across Jamaica. We invite individuals, families, companies everywhere.
