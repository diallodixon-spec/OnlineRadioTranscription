20260101 180002 Not until that day I found you, turned around and you were there. From the day you came, you gave me a point of view. I've been touched by an angel, it's impossible but true. I believe in you. I swear that forever from today No one will ever take your pain I believe in you And I believe our love will last always I never believed in fairy tales Those were times I wished I could I never believed that golden slippers Could ever find the perfect hood I never believed in magic Only wishes
