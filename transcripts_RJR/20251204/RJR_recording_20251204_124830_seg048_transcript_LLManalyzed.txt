I encourage your friends and relatives to do so as well, so that we can all donate securely, submit pledges, or locate nearby shelters. Every act of kindness, every dollar, helps bring hope and healing to our island home. Let's stand together. Let's rebuild stronger. Because when we Jamaicans unite, nothing can break us. Spread the word today. You're now listening to Emily Shields Talk With Substance on Hotline. Radio Jamaica, active for the good of our nation.
