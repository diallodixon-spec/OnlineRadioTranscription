============================================================

Until the morning sun appears Making light of all my fears I dry the tears I've never shown I hold you on my own. But when I'm done and feeling blue, I close my eyes so I can be with you. Oh, baby, be strong for me. Baby, be love to me. Help me through. Help me need you.
