20251216 134033 I know that for you I would sacrifice for all that you would need to be forgettable I can't imagine living without you, without you My world would just stop spinning Without you Without you Floating on a cloud Each time you say my name I wanna scream out loud You're driving me insane Driving me crazy baby Each time you go I wanna fall deeper and deeper Each time we kiss I'm feeling it deeper and deeper and deeper When you love me like you do baby
