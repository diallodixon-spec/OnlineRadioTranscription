20251225 090002 Christmas once again to you and Kitty. Big ups to Phil Moore over there in Canada. He says I love to say, I want to say Merry Christmas to my wife, Antoinette, and the four kids, Anja, Anelka, Naila, and Nivi. It's coming from Fillmore in Canada. That's it for me. That's my time. Gotta go. I don't know. Maybe it's Santa Claus. Big up to everyone who kept my company from 5 o'clock. See y'all tomorrow and enjoy your Christmas day today.
