this morning on Thursday. Meanwhile, Children's Advocate Dan Gordon-Harrison agrees that security personnel assigned to schools must be exposed to system that's in place to ensure safety and security. And the training that takes place with the school, I'm sure that training does happen, but that training perhaps needs to have refresher instalments so that persons are consistently aware and that all the stakeholders are brought in. So it's not just the administration and the teachers who need to be exposed, but persons who otherwise support the school community. So have them, you know, the security guys, for example, being in the system and a part of the training consistently.
