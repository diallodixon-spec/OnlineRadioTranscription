20251217 174132 a big day in Florida where they had started deporting people. And there are other things that are happening too, like recently they tried to pass an executive order or get an executive order implemented that would stop individuals from gaining birthright citizenship here in the United States. And so those are just some of the things that we're dealing with right now. And as far as it relates to Jamaicans and other immigrants, I think one of the biggest factor is that they are now going to be looking for folks. I think many people have been here for years and kind of have the ability to work on the, you know, quote unquote under the table, you know, get paid, kind of just be able to live. A lot of states give you a driver's license. It's going to be very hard to do that now. And I think that's in the most simplest of terms what's going to happen is people's lives are going to get disrupted. And you mentioned that you know deportation has been amped up and I did a new story today where we're seeing that it is reported that ICE has been mandated that they need to have a quota of 1200 to 1500 arrests per day.
