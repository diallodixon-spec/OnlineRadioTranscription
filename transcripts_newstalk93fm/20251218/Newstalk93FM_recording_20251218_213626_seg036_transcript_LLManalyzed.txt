Bring it back before the villain. I had a life, real talk, true religion. It's in the blood, in the genes, in the stitching. Walked in, no weapon, made a killing. Tongue kissing pretty women. New iPhone cause I'm done with all the... Trying to be in my position. Keep my shades on cause they're trying to see the vision. You tell me bad man, see I need your love. See I need your love, me need you close to me, me tell her see me or stay on the road. Bad energy stay far away, make you stay far away.
