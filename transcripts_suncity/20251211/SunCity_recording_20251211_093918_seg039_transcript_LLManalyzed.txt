That's our garland, right? And so even though the largest language is what we call tree, I'm from the second group. And I'm also, I call myself mixed race because my dad's from the mountains. They're like a mixture of gar and a kind as well. So we have so many ways of saying it. So wow, go on. It's funny. I don't know if you guys saw the thing from Stoneboy where he was breaking down how Jamaican patois is so close to a can, to gar, and to chew, the way we talk, and not just the actual words, because remember, you guys still have Bami, and Komi, and Dukunu. What do you guys call Dukunu? Kenke, we call it Kenke. Our word for it, Du, and the Jamaican word for it is Dukunu. As far as I understand, which is like the cornmeal. But the way we speak, the inflections, you know, wute se, wa a se, wa a gwan, you know, so it's, even though the words are different the inflections almost exist.
