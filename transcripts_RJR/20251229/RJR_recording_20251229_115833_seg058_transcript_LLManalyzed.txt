20251229 115833 and for enabling us in the various facets of our lives. You have been present to open doors where a way forward was unclear. You have rekindled hope in hopeless situations. You have enabled persons to rise above their negative and condemning realities. Because you are a God of life, a God of hope, and a God of possibilities. Make yourself known afresh to those who are feeling cornered by their circumstances. Grant them courage, grant them vision, vision of a new possibility, and in your sovereign power, your unconditional love, and your abundant grace enable them to realize their potential and the transformation they are longing for. We ask this in your loving and precious name, O Lord. Amen.
