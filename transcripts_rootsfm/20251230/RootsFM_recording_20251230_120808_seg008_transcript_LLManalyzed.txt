You said these are they that overcome by the words of their testimony and this afternoon we come to tell you thanks because you have been a faithful God. Faithful God indeed you are. Faithful and just you are. We thank you. We thank you we shall back you this afternoon and we tell you thanks for your goodness and for your mercies in Jesus' name. Amen. Hallelujah. Bless the lord Dr. Turnbull. Compliment of the season. We enjoyed the Christmas and the Black Spring Day. Giving thanks for a complete of 12 months, 12-mile journey. It's so much warfare, so much think-tank-continuation, negative and positive, those hotspots, those evil altars.
