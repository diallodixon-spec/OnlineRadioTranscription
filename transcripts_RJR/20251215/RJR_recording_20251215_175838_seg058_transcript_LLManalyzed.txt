20251215 175838 I'm not going to just be quiet. We're going to make sure that the whole world knows that the Hanukkah lights, the message that light will dispel darkness, light will overcome darkness, will be louder than ever before. And how do we do that? By being kinder to each other as the motto of Jamaica out of many one people. And we have seen it. I have seen it firsthand, besides our own hurricane relief, seen it with the other organizations, people being so selfless and just caring for a neighbor. They got a barrel from New York or from Florida, they shared half of the barrel with their neighbors. They got whatever they had. And that is our response, not just to any challenge in life, is we have to get up stronger and better. I have to leave it there. Thank you so much, Rabbi. I very much appreciate it.
