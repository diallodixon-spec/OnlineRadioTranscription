============================================================

You know I know how To make them stop and stare as I fall out The clock ain't even handle me right now Watching you, watching me, I go all out The club can't even handle me right now The club can't handle me right now Can't knock the hell out of me right now I'll see you together, let's get em' hit I own the night and I don't need no help Gotta be the better-next-time face player Stuck gone wild, can't handle this pair. Fight for the club, arrogant like yeah. Top like money, so the girls just melt. One too many, y'all know me like 12. Look like cash and they all just there. Bottles, models, better not share. Ball out, cuz that's the business. All out, it's so ridiculous. Don't have so much attention.
