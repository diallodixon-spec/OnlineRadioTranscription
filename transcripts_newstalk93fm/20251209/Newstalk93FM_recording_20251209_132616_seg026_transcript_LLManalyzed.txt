I guess I didn't run out of options. Can't keep fantasizing. I'm calling you so we can lock in. But you call me toxic. You make it easy for me to believe in your loving. You better believe it because maybe I'm leaving with something. It's better than than the dick you had before Smiling cause you know I know you know I You better sell, I treat you well, I will It's good I can tell, come give me hell, come here Your fairy tale, under your spell, I am She gets your nail, oh well it all depends You scream and yell, can't come for help from here You leave in whelps, I feel your nails for real I hit you good, you sleepin' good for real I read you out, I read you out out loud
