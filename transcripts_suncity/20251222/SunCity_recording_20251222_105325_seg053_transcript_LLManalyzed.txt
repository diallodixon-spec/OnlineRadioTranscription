Jingle bells jingle bells jingle all the way, oh what fun it is too ride in a one-horse open sleigh. Dashing through the snow in a one horse open sleigh All the fields we go Rappin' all the way Bells on bobtails ring Makin' spirits bright Oh, what fun we're gonna have tonight Singin' place gone bright Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way. Oh, what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh. Jingle bells. Jingle all the way.
