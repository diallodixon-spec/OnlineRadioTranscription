============================================================

We did a pretty good job of it. Save a couple of, you know, the early in the first game and then late in the second game where that kind of got away from us. But, you know, it all turned out okay. All right, talk about, a couple of minutes left here now. Talk about what's going to be happening going forward now. What are we looking at? Yeah, so it's interesting because what is in front of us is two games February 26th against the Bahamas and March 1st against Canada. Those are the other two teams in our pool Our qualifying pool. There's currently 16 teams in this World Cup qualifier 16 will be paired paired down to 12. And then from those 12, the top seven will go to the World Cup in 27 in Qatar. So we have Bahamas on February 26, Canada on March 1.
