20251216 120204 $5 million provided by the OUR to JPS, right? What about the other companies that in Korea and Japan who are 40% each? They also can help with the recovery process. But Jamaica, we the people lend JPS 150 million US dollars and on top of that we have to pay a 7% increase in electricity rates. I think this is unconscionable at this time. And I need to hear from other bodies. I need to hear the private sector organization of Jamaica who have members. The Jamaica Manufacturers and Export Association. The Jamaica Chamber of Commerce.
