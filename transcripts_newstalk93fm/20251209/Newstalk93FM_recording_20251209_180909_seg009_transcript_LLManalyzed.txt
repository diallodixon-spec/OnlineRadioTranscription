It ain't love, it ain't love It ain't love they see But it ain't none to discuss Cause it is to me And so what? I fell, you fell In love a couple times Tell me, what's it to ya? Tell me, is it a crime To fall, to fall In love, in love a couple times Tell me, what's it to ya? Tell me, is it a crime to fall? Is it a crime? I'll let it grind, no Cause if loving me is jail Then you're my prisoner So let me throw away this key cause you won't give me up They don't know that we don't give up All they want is to see us breaking up You can search the seven seas and never find no A heart like mine, better yet can't forget my mind
