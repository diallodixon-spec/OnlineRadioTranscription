20251216 181408 they are trap dancehall artists okay remember in a bujo sorry not bujo but bounty killer bean man they did reggae songs as well but even though they did reggae song them never said they are a reggae artist Sizzler is a reggae artist even though him do hold up a dancehall song so you understand stay in your lane enough how i want to say dancehall dead i don't know why i want to say so the young the younger one said the younger one said I don't know why them said that honestly don't understand why them said i don't know why they say that. Honestly, I don't understand why they said that. They must not see what's going on. They must not understand the business. If you say dancehall dead, don't call yourself a dancehall artist. You have to find some dancehall beat because because the rhythm the beats that you're DJing on they're not dancehall beats okay so big up to high water real dancehall artists who do one or two dancehall trap songs but mostly dancehall music and we need more dancehall artists
