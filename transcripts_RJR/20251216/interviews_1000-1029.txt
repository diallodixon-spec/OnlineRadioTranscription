**Interview with Sudhu Ramani, CEO of H&L True Value**

In a recent interview on Radio Jamaica's "Hotline" program, Dr. Orville Taylor sat down with Sudhu Ramani, CEO of H&L True Value, to discuss the company's involvement in the hurricane relief efforts in Jamaica. H&L True Value has partnered with Trans Jamaica to distribute essential items such as lumber, zinc, and other building materials to affected communities.

Ramani expressed his company's commitment to the relief efforts, stating that they have been serving Jamaica for over 95 years and are happy to be given the opportunity to partner with Trans Jamaica. He highlighted the complexity of the operation, with trailer loads of materials arriving every two days and a team working to offload and distribute them to approximately 2,500 households in the region.

When asked why H&L True Value was chosen as a partner, Ramani attributed it to the company's integrated system, logistical capabilities, and wide range of products that cater to various needs. He also mentioned that the company's own block-making factory and third-party logistics company, Avalon 2, have been instrumental in the relief efforts.

Ramani shared his experience touring the affected areas, noting the resilience of Jamaicans and the rapid recovery efforts. He also discussed the company's modular homes, which are made of concrete panels and can be constructed in as little as four weeks. These homes have been tested and certified by the Bureau of Standards and meet Jamaican building standards.

The interview showcased the important role that H&L True Value is playing in the hurricane relief efforts and highlighted the company's commitment to supporting the affected communities. As Ramani stated, "Jamaica is a very resilient country, and Jamaicans are very resilient people. When I toured the affected areas right after the hurricane...when I toured it two days back, leaves are growing back already. And it's the same with the Jamaicans. You dust off your knees, you get up and you start working and cleaning and rebuilding."
