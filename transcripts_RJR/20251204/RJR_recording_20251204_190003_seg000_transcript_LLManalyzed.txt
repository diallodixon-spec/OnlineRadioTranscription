I'm happy for the team that won. Southborough Primary was voted the most disciplined team while Angels won the Dress Parade. Former champions Manchester United gave up the lead with less than 10 minutes to go in regulation time and had to settle for a 1-0 draw with West Ham United in the English Premier League Championship at Old Trafford on Thursday. Portuguese international Diego Dalló gave the Red Devils the lead in the 58th minute before Sonoku Magasa earned the Hammers a share of the points seven minutes from time as United endured another frustrating night at Old Trafford. United are now eighth on 22 points while West Ham are third from bottom in the relegation zone on the 12 points. Finally the University of the West Indies defeated Monique College 7259 at Monique on Thursday in action from the Intercollegiate Basketball Competition
