There you shall find a piece of advice If you hit your enemies, enemies shine If you're not a friend of me, enter the light. Cause you can never kill my vibe. Cause there ain't no sacrifices. Everything was taken, still had to make it. Vibe killer, me and you go take a vibe killer. Somebody time, protect my energy from your bad aura.
