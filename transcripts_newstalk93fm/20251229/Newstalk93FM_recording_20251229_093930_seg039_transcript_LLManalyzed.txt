20251229 093930 I've been drinking more, oh, for the past five days Did you check on me? Now did you look for me? I walked in the room, eyes are red and I don't smoke banga Did you check on, me did you check on me Now did you notice me? Nobody will know the pattern of your world Cause I put a smile on my face A facade you can never face And if you don't know me well, well, well You won't see how buried I am inside my grave
