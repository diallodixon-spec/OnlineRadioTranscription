20251219 113021 I love the way that you bring a vibe We chance them up in the sky Rolling back and having a time Now we lyin' in the game And we have hell money to spend And we jammin' down to the end See me with me cannibal friend Then me cannibal, friend, friend, friend. Now make a new boyfriend friend, friend friend. Yeah, now make a new boyfriend. Until he beats up again. I wish he'd come from there. Sandu, I wish he'd gone from there. Karanaj, I wish he come from there. And she loves you back and on. I wish she'd come from there, Arima, I wish she come from there. Amalaba, I wish she'd gone from there, yeah, yeah, yeah. Now she loves you back and on. I wish she come from there. Arima, wish she comes from there. Amalaba, wish she came from there. No, she loves you back anon. Ay, ay, ay. No, me cannibal friend, ay. Ay, ay. No me cannibal friend. Ay. Ay.
