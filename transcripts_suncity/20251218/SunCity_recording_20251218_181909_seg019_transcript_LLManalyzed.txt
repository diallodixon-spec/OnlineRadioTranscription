I am Mariana Palmer. I am a project manager under the UMona Guild EAC committee and a second year psychology major for me I was always a shy person. He would not get me speak up. But then I found something that I love and that's giving back. That's giving my time and more hands on. So if you're gonna give me a device to make a poster, I can't do it. But if you give me a job, say, okay, go and help, I can do that. That's something I am good at. So I found something I love and I worked on it. So giving back, it's not only for me, I always say service above self. So no matter how tired I am, I'm like, all right, I am here and I'm okay. And there are other persons who aren't. So let me see if I can help as best as I can, even if I am.
