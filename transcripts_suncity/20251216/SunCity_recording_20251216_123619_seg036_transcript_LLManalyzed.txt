Here at Sun City, 104.9 FM, our mandate is to educate, empower and entertain you, our listeners. The beat of the drum, the strumming of the bass guitar, the unison of the keyboard, the steadiness of the rhythm guitar, energy from the percussion, and the voice cementing the sound. This is reggae music. The coming together of swords uniting the world in harmony and peace.
