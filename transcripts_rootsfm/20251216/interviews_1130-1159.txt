**Rabbi Yaakov Raskin Discusses Hurricane Relief Efforts and Upcoming Concert in Jamaica**

In a recent interview on Roots FM, Rabbi Yaakov Raskin, Director of Chabad Jamaica, spoke about the organization's efforts to provide relief to those affected by the recent hurricane that struck the western part of Jamaica. Rabbi Raskin, who has been living in Jamaica for 12 years, expressed his gratitude for the support of the Jamaican community and announced an upcoming concert to raise funds for the relief efforts.

The concert, which will take place on December 21st at the East Lawn of King's House, will feature three singers, including Alex Clear, a platinum award-winning singer from Britain, and two local Jamaican singers, Young Ross and Chris Malach. The event is being held under the patronage of His Excellency, the Governor General, and all proceeds will go towards providing relief to those affected by the hurricane.

Rabbi Raskin emphasized the importance of addressing the mental health issues that have arisen as a result of the hurricane, stating that "mental health is real, very important." He announced that the organization plans to bring in social workers to work with the affected communities and provide them with the support they need.

The Rabbi also shared his personal experience of living through the hurricane, describing the fear and damage that his family and community suffered. However, he expressed his gratitude for the support of the Jamaican community and the resilience of the people, stating that "we're so blessed, as much as the destruction we see."

The concert is open to everyone, and tickets can be purchased online at lightjamaica.com. Rabbi Raskin encouraged people to attend the concert, not only to support the relief efforts but also to have a good time and enjoy the music. He emphasized that "each one of us, by buying a ticket, can be a spiritual generator, a spiritual diesel, spiritual gas to our people in the West."

In a heartfelt message, Rabbi Raskin urged people to continue doing good and to never be satisfied with their efforts, stating that "when we're doing something good, we have to keep increasing in the lights. Never be satisfied when you do something good. Keep going more." He expressed his gratitude to those who have supported the relief efforts and announced that the organization will continue to work tirelessly to provide support to those in need.

The interview ended with Rabbi Raskin wishing everyone a happy Hanukkah and thanking them for their support. The concert is expected to be a powerful and uplifting event, and all proceeds will go towards supporting the relief efforts in Jamaica.
