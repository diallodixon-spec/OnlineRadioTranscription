20251230 193425 What can you tell us about these names? I see some names here man. Chines and Carlos and Schoolboy, Tiger and Big Bear. What can you tell about those names? Why those names? Anyone? Well as it relates to the name Tiger, I was given that name when I started playing the draft as a teenager. It was given to me on the basis that they said I played the game very attacking, with a lot of stroke and very aggressive. I understand that as it relates to Shine. He had always been a very talented youngster who outshined most of his peers. Big Bear is online, that's our public relations officer. I guess you can see that's how he got that name.
