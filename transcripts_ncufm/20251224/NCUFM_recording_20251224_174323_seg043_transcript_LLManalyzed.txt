20251224 174323 We'll walk hand in hand And the birds and the bees Together they stand No more weeping there No more sorrow to bear No more more night is near. Cause there is no need to fear. I'm talking about heaven. Ooh, my longing home. I'm taking about heaven. Where love roams, where Jesus and I spend eternity in that holy city.
