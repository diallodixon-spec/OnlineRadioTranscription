20251218 142815 I'm wondering if it's me you'll see, yeah Then I'll kiss your eyes And thank God we're together I just wanna stay with you In this moment forever Forever and ever I don't wanna close my eyes I don't wanna fall asleep cause I miss you baby And I don't wanna miss a thing Cause even when I dream of you The sweetest dream will never do I still miss you baby, and I don't want to miss a thing. I don't wanna miss one smile. I don't want a miss one kiss. I just want to be with you right here with you, just like this.
