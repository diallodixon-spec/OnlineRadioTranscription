Baby, I've traveled through the stars And many moves to find you Baby, the sugar on your skin The sweetest melanin, yeah See when you step out into the light And your body looking right No constellation in the sky right now Say it to me I will be around for the entire night See baby while I'm close I'll be here by your side You're doing things to me that I cannot deny The way you're looking girl, you are so certified Put me back one time when you give me that fast wine, fast wine fast wine Fast wine fast wine fast wine
