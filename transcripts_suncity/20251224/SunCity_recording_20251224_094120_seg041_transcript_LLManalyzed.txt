Marcus Garvey is the godfather, is the nucleus of this philosophy. And so any young man or woman that are of African descent needs to study more on this, need to do their research. And as it relates to modern technology, yes, there are so much well-educated, well-confident young men in Nigeria, in Jamaica, in Barbados, all over the world, with our ancestors' blood running to us. Yes, they're standing up, educated. They're empowering their people. They're doing great work. And so the African renaissance is on the rise. I just want us to unite, though, to facilitate the reality of this, to unity. That's all we want.
