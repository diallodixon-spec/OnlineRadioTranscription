20251230 203822 I want to show you my world. Give me one break, I need faith. Faith to believe you, faith to receive you. Give me something I'm lacking, I don't need nothing. You are my everything. Only me and you, Only me and you Only me and you Make me your matter Make me your mother, make me your mother Make me your mother Show me your substance, make me your closet Make me your closet Give me one break, I ain't even mad
