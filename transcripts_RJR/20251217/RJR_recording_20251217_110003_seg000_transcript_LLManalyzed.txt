20251217 110003 We're slowly getting back, I think we're at 80 something percent of electricity back in many areas and so the Jamaica Constabulary is going to continue to make sure that they are patrolling by foot in the days of course and they are definitely patrolling during the night. And so we have not heard of any incidents anywhere and so the JCF will continue to be strident in their efforts to combat anyone who wants to take advantage of not having electricity or the militia, the damages that occurred. And so they will continue to be out there in their numbers during this Christmas season to protect and serve. Let me call you back right after the headlines for a couple more minutes. I've got to go to the headlines now. Thank you so much. Okay. All right. You're listening to Radio Jamaica 94 FM. This time signal is brought to you by the Jamaica Social Investment Fund, JSAVE, through the Georgia's Community Electrification Project. And the time courtesy of the Jamaican Social Investment Fund is now eleven o'clock.
