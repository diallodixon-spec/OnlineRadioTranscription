20251230 152017 to be grateful for. I'm a Panjolica. I'm a son of the sun I love the sea, I love the sun, Lord, I love this land Don't matter where I go, Jamaica is my home I love the girls who can't bother on the way home I hear some people say they are going away But if I even leave, I won't be going away this day
