20251218 185036 Congratulations being the founder of Jamaica Skate Culture Foundation. When did this organization get off the ground? Tell us about that, please. I mean, we started like 10 years ago in Treasure Beach with me bridging from Bred's Foundation. Oh, they have a sport park. And I did my first skateboard workshop over there. And in 2020, I started the foundation because I knew I wanted to do something, you know, for the youth in Jamaica. And in 2019, when I came here again, I started building a skate park in Huey and, you know, linked with all the youth that love skateboarding from Pool Bay, Kingston, Boston Bay. I started with my wife, the Jamaica Skateboard Foundation, Jamaica Skate Culture Foundation.
