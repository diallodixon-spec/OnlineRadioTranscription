20251222 193419 court matters to Kingston, this as a result of damage to court facilities from Hurricane Melissa. Director of Client Services, Communication and Information at the CAD, Khadish Jarrett Fletcher, says among others, the Rodney Memorial building, which houses the court's administrative operations, sustained major water damage, and its floor is at risk of caving in. Sittings of the lay magistrates have been suspended to allow for the room to be used by administrative staff in order to facilitate the continuation of parish court matters. Mrs. Jared Fletcher is appealing for understanding from members of the public that it is an offence to dump garbage, swim in, take water from or interfere with water from its open canal system. Public education specialist with the commission, Christine Forbes, says the open canal system is critical for providing water to farmers.
