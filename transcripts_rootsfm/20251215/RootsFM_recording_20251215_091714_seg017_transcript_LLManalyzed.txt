Don't let love come just to pass us by Tryin', it's all we have to do It's up to me and you To make this special I can't explain the way you make me feel Every time that you do me, that you love me And you know you did it too many times Just when I thought that love could never be a part of me That's when you came along You showed me happiness, baby you are the most beautiful
