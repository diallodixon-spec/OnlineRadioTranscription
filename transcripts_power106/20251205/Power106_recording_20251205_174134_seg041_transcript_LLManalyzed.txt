For Christmas is you I don't want a lot for Christmas There is just one thing I need Don't care about the presents Underneath the Christmas tree I don't need to hang my stockings There upon the fireplace Santa Claus will make me happy With a toy on Christmas day I just want you for my own More than you could ever know Make my wish come true All I want for Christmas is you Ooh, baby Oh, I won't ask for much this Christmas
