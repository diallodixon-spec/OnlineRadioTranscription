20251212 214725 You ripped the veil from my mind, I know you You said seek and you will find, I'll follow you You are one of a kind, I follow you So I'm never gonna stop, never gonna stop searching. I'm never going to stop, never going to stop searching. Whether all the mountains high or still waters nice searching. Oh invincible God, I thirst for you. You take my doubts away, I hear you. You speak from deep within, I fear you.
