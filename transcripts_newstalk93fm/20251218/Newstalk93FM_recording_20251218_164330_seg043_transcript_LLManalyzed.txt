20251218 164330 Our masterpiece, owned by my, owned by my love. I take one look at you, you're taking me out of the ordinary. I want you laying me down, to the dead and buried. On the edge of your knife, staying drunk on your vine. The angels up in the clouds, are jealous knowing we found something so out of the ordinary. You got me kissing the ground of your sanctuary. Shatter. Hopeless hallelujah. Holy side of heaven's gate. Oh, my life, how do you breathe and take my breath away?
