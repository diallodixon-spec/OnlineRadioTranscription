20251215 150305 to actually draft the letter. Now, the letter of administration has not been done because they haven't been able to come up with certain documents down in Jamaica. And it looks like the effort is going to be more complicated than I thought. For example, we don't have their original will for the person. We have the second page, but we don't have the first page, which I think is blank. Anyway, it looks like before they can do this letter of administration, they're going to have to do a lot of other stuff. And I don't feel like I'm getting the cooperation of the people in Jamaica who have all the documents. My question is, can I end my contract for them to do that letter? And can I get my money back that I've paid them to draft the letter, which I don't have yet.
