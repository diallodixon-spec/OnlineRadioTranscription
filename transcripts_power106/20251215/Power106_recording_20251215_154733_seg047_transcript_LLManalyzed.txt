20251215 154733 I'm getting a message here on our WhatsApp line about reception in Salem in St. Anne. This is RM saying Mr. Blake, the reception here is terrible. I'm missing my university class today. That's from RM. We do apologize for that. I was asking RM if, well, I don't know if you can hear us but which frequency Are you listening to us on? first of all, which device if it's a if it's the FM transmission We may have a suggestion or two for you. I Know in that area of the island the engineers recently did some work in terms of the transmission in Saint Anne. Let's see if we can just do that quickly.
