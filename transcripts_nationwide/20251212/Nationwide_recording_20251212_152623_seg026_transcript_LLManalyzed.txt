Now, in an interview with the Jamaica Observer, Justin Campbell, a director of Fnatic, shared how he was able to get Tommy Lee Sparta for the events lineup. It was quite challenging, especially given the timing and the ongoing rivalry between him and fellow popular artist Massica. However, through our mutual connection, we were able to make it happen. And we are extremely grateful to Tommy Lee Sparta and his team for supporting us and agreeing to deliver this performance. It will be nothing short of iconic, said Campbell moment. Proper DM. The organizers of Fanatic have decided to make it easier for students of the University of the West Indies who wish to attend the event. There is a specially discounted ticket price in place. Holders of those tickets will be shuttled free of cost to the event. I remember my days on campus. I remember when we had these events, these shows off campus.
