============================================================

You looked at me To my surprise You were too anticipating I shouldn't know It was in your lies That you were getting tired of waiting You wanted me so much But I didn't get it How could I find a piece of the line? I started to give up, but love wouldn't let it. Then you walked into my life, and we began to rock. Steady, steady, rocking all night long. And we began to rock. Steady. Rockin' till the break of dawn. Rock. Steady. Steady rockin' all night long. All night long. Rock.
