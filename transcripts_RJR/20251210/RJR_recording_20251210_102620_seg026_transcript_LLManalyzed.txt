right and to my left there's traffic where am I to go in this case who can you talk to regarding and as I said it's not just a regular person doing this these are persons in authority an emergency is an emergency though I know that I respect that I respect that that's the. I respect emergency vehicles. But I've seen where, because of their careless driving, where it caused an accident, not because it's not broken up, it's happening. All I'm saying is the emergency is going to pull over. You are going to be pulling over. But please do so when it's safe. That's what I'm saying. If I'm to pull over, you have the utility, JPS working, so I'll be pulling over. But please do so when it's safe. As I said, if I'm to pull over, you have the utility JPS working, so I'll be pulling off into the parked utility vehicle and there's a line of traffic going both ends. So could we do it when it's safe?
