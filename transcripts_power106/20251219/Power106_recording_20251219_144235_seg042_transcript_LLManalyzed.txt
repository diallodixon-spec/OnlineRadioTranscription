20251219 144235 at the front of the building at 32 Lindhurst Road, and this is the Power 106 FM Farmers Market. And I see Peter Thompson, Executive Director of the Jamaica Forage Clubs. He has rolled in the Jamaica Forage Club, supporting us in a big way, because they are the ones who provided the farmers for us, the contacts with the farmers, and of course, other types of support as well. So I look forward to speaking with Mr. Thompson in a few minutes or not so long from now. Let me tell you something. Everything that you need, every vegetable that you need is here. Lettuce, carrot, zucchini, onions, broccoli, cabbage, I see garlic, pak choy, all kinds of sweet pepper, cucumber, beetroot, ginger, string bean, yes even green banana, can you believe it?
