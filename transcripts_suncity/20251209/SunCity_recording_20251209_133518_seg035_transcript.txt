This one goes out to the nation Are you building Sun City radio we a deal with Stop the violence and the corruption They have to make a better solution to the youths them You could a cuss, you could a bust, you could a ball But call the guns them, them off and leave we yard Yo, this is your girl Shireen on front line duty for the rebuilding of Jamaica, what we say? The land we love. Sun City Radio 104.9 FM, radio with a difference, radio with a meaning. Talk if you're talking, or walk if you're walking. Suns sitting, not playing.
