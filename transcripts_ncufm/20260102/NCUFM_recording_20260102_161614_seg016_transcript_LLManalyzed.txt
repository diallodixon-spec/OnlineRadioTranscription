20260102 161614 Almost the whole day. And as I come after laughting, sometimes we can't get no service. We just check it a little while and miss a little service Uncle Michael. And the song we hear, you know, me and my friend outside, I come in, come listen to the song, you know. They are wonderful. I love them. I love these songs. When these songs are playing, you turn up ready, you know. Oh God. Have yourself a wonderful afternoon now. Good afternoon again brother Michael. Marcia Sims is still on the drive with you sir. Happy Sabbath to you and your lovely wife Joni Lee and the rest of the family when it comes. Happy Sabbath to all my St. John's Day church family. Happy New Year to you also and God's willing we will meet tomorrow for the official Happy New Year's greetings. Happy Sabbath to my drive time families both at home and abroad. I wish for you
