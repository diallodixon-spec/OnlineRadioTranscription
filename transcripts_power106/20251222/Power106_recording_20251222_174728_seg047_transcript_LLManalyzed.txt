20251222 174728 Cause your love just won't wait Ooh baby I love your way, every day I wanna tell you I love your way every day I wanna be with you night and day The moon appears to shine and light the sky With the help of some firefly I wonder how they have the fire to shine, shine, shine Well, I can see them under the fine. But don't, whoa, no, no, hesitate. La-di-da. Cause your love just rolled away. Hey, hey, hey.
