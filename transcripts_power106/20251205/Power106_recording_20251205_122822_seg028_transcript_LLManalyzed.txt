The matches are as they were previously planned. Saturday the 13th of December and Sunday the 14th of December. So it's 2pm UK time, that will be 9am Jamaica time on Saturday and Sunday. Those matches will be on Monday December 8. But before we get to England, come out this Friday December 5 at 7pm at the National Indoor Sports Centre. They're asking you to bring the vibes, energy and your donations. We're charging a minimal cost of $500 for adults, $200 for children and then additionally we will be doing collection drives. You have a vital role to play in securing the future of Vision 2030 Jamaica. By reducing your use of single-use plastics, reusing the ones you have and refusing them when shopping or eating out, you are contributing to the environment
