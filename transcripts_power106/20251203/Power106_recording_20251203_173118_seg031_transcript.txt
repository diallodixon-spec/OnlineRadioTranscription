Um, so I think next week we could look at that. It would be really, really a good program. Definitely. Definitely, Roderick. Agreed. So we will do that then. Yes? Okay. Thank you. Yeah, man. Thank you very much. It's always a pleasure to have you. Same here, Shirley. Thanks again. Thanks a lot. All right. So there you have it, Mr. Roderick Biles, Managing Director.
