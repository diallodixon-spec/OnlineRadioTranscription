This is the day when the fittest of fittest survive and the weak shall inherit the earth. And no surprise every country decriminalize, now the weed will replenish the earth. If you're not wise like your eyes, you're gonna meet your demise, the weak shall be buried in dirt. Weeping and moaning and a shin of teeth, your weak and even your belly with earth human a plan on a platform in the earth reverse on them not do many like research remember say we are prince of princesses on the earth don't feel like a penny's worth in true hills and valleys and many rivers a penis of where we deserve no man we're used to are like any reserve can't step in a enemy turf false prophets tell we step in the church gotta come January 1st we more than one people gathered a reasonable charge I remember say them is the church in the abundance of water me look up with laughter to see many stilled fitters while my bread of them are dead for turf. That's why I and I a step. Steppin' on Mount Zion. Steppin on Mount Zion. Now the Gideon we step. Stepping on Mount Zion. I a man a step. Stepping a Mount Zion. The Rastaman a step.
