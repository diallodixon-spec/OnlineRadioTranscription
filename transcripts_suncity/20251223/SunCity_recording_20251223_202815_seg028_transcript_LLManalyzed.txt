20251223 202815 Here we go. I don't like when I'm alone, got me sending all of these pics to your phone In my time I said you want all of this, in my mind over this, through the phone, in my kiss For me you have to give me my peek, now get close now, got free to be a cyber freak Them don't know how you're good good to me. You see the prey, you're the man for me. Can't wait for you, put my body in line. Hold me up, show me up, tell me you're mine. When I come or you come no say it's time. To put my body in drive. Overseas love.
