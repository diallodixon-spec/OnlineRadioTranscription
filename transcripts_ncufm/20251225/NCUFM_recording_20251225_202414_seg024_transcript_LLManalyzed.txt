20251225 202414 When I started off this journey We spent so much time, we were friends Success and where we should open doors So busy, don't have time anymore Even while you're there, I need you now But this morning just won't go away I wish you'd stay, sit in my heart When I think about this goodness and all of the things he's done My song has now been registered Ashamed of who I've let me become But I know where I'm going now
