20251219 163924 I'll be talking to my hell and I don't even notice. She got me me living like a zombie I shoulda shoot like Chuck Norris The way she put that body down You got me falling truly I just touched down When I see you now I believe I can keep my cool, but tonight I'm worried I'm a beast In a dangerous mood, can you match my heart?
