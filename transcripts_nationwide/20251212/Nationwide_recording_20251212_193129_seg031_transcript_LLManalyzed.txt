20251212 193129 to schools that allow these kinds of breaches to take place. Let me get the question out Stuart Jacobs. Should it be business as usual? Should there be no sense of accountability, no sanctioning of the schools that allow for a breach of this nature to take place? What's the NPTJ's position on that? What we will do on Monday is to make contact with the school principal, to the PTA, to the head of the PTA, and try and get an audience. It's something that we do quite often. And most principals, all principals... Hold on there, Mr. Jacobs. So you have not made contact with the parent teacher representative? We tried, we tried. We tried unsuccessfully to be honest with you. We tried unsuccessfully. This happened on Tuesday now. Today is Friday Mr. Jacobs. We tried unsuccessful. We tried. We tried.
