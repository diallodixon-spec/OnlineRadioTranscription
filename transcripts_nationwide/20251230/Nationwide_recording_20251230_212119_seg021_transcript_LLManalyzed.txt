20251230 212119 What caused you to look past the looks? The personality! The personality is the same guy where you say okay I'll stand. Every time he comes around you and your friend, your spirit gets crossed. He's the same personality. The looks don't matter to me. The personality is in the backpack. But his personality comes out at me and says oh but I can measure it. I can work with it. How could you be attracted to the personality 6 months down the road when you're there around him every day and you say okay, I'll stand him? He's the same guy. I have a question. Would you date an ugly man that's rich or a poor man with a great personality and him look decent? She said she can manage ugly. She can negotiate ugly. The hottest man you ever see and he doesn't have money. A man where you have to say, damn. But remember, all the highway he can give you if you want it. If you're alone, drive for it. What's the choice?
