20251231 145136 I don't keep it shut, I hate it when you hit and reach out your newness I hate cause your theories catch fire I can't find no silver lining I don't mean to judge But when you read your speech it's firing Enough is enough I'm covering my ears like a kid When your words mean nothing I go la la la I'm turning up the fire when you speak Cause if my heart can't stop it I'll follow into rock and I go I'm following you back as I go
