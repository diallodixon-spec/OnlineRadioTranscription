20251229 210103 me everywhere listen to you every day oh oh my sweet inspiration but i feel like i can't do what i'm supposed to and i can't even pick myself up out of bed you come around with so much energy fill me with such melodies Oh, my sweet motivation When you speak to me, I hear a song Every word you say feels like a poem I will take you with me everywhere. Listen to you every day. Oh, why are you my deep inspiration? And I don't wanna say goodbye. This love that I'm feeling gives me life. On top of a lake, a runaway train.
