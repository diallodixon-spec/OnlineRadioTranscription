20251226 135142 For you I'd give a lifetime of stability Anything you want of me Nothing is impossible for you There are no words or ways to show my love Or all the thoughts I'm thinking of Cause this life is no good alone Since we've become one I've made a change And everything I do now makes sense All roads end, all I do is for you For you I share the cup of wine
