147th man to play test cricket for West Indies when he turned out for the first test against New Zealand in Christchurch She's took 2 for 34 in the first innings then followed up with a 2 for 74 in the second innings The former homo-tech standout says things could have been so different Six months ago. I was actually thinking about giving up because you know with age and stuff coming on I was thinking that I don't think I would get this opportunity to play for the West Indies again so I didn't think it was necessary to be fighting for a spot for the Jamaica Scorpions without any hopes of going any further. I'm a lover of music so the same Nevada song I told you never give up that was a song I always listen and try to keep a positive mindset. Shields shared the moment he got the call from head coach Darren Sammy. When I got the call I was literally sleeping because I left training and then I went to the gym so I was a little tired so I went home and was sleeping I heard the phone ringing took it up it was the head coach Darren Sammy
