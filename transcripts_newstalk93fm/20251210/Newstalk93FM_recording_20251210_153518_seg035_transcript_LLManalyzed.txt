============================================================

I don't need a rich to somebody that can make me feel safe. Yeah I don't want a couple but nobody ever made me feel safe Cause when I'm with you I just know I'm fine You take all the pressure off my mind Patient and kind will not be going out my mind Say from the problems I don't worry cause I'm hard to find I know it right at home, safe in your arms, baby, come hold me down. Come hold me down, huh? Save like a key and a lock on me. Save like a crib with a combo, please. Hold you down. Hold you down, down, down. I can put my guard down. I can pull my heart out. Love when you're around. Love when you around, huh? Unplug the alarm now.
