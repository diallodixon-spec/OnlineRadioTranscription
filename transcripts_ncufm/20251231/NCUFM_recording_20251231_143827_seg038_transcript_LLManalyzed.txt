20251231 143827 really believe in Old Testament. They quote a lot from the Old Testament. They say the Old Testament is done away with. We are no longer living under law. That's done away with. Here is Jesus in the New Testament talking about a new commandment. But what does it really mean for a new commandment? Just let me pause right here. I say we're going to do an exposition of the text. This commandment, this new command to love, it was not necessarily new in and of itself. As a matter of fact, right now I could go to Leviticus chapter 19. I'm in Leviticus, chapter 19, verse 18. So this is Old Testament. This is showing you that this concept that Jesus is talking about is not something that is new in the terms of the word new. I will explain verse 19 verse 18 says you shall not take vengeance nor bear any grudge against the children of your people but you shall love your neighbor
