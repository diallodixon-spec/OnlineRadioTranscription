2025-12-11 20:08:28 One day I'm at a chip farm with some friends, a friend, Jeremy and Carol. And Jeremy's like, Audrey, you need to get back on stage and I'll show them how this thing is done. And I'm like, no, no interest. And then I say, you know what? It's not a bad idea, you know. Maybe I should try this again. I guess it was just time. Hello? Yes. This time, Grand Prix Bahamas Pro Qualifying Nassau. I think you need to go there immediately because this is quite extraordinary. Talk about your achievements at this particular event, Audrey. Yes. Well, I went to the Cabin Grand Prix. I decided to do the Cabin Grandentry and I only went there to do the Wellness. I was only training for Wellness, which is the Bikini Wellness, only one category. And when I got there, the organiser was like, are you doing other categories? I was like, no, I only train for one category.
