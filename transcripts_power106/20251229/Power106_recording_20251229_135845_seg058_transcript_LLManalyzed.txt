Living in the positive, hunger ain't no good, we can't go even. Jar is here amidst the battle. Hunger ain't no love, we'll overcome it. We're living in the positive. Let not your heart be troubled Wipe away your tears and fears Cause I know love will conquer evil And we're living in the positive. From day to day, John milk our way.
