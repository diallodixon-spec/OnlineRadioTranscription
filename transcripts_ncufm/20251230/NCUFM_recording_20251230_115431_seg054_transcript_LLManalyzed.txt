20251230 115431 Because we know that you are with us. Lord, as we choose to go through this day with you, I'm asking that you will show us, give us tokens of your love. That you will demonstrate clearly to us that no matter what happens to us, it doesn't define us. It doesn't change who we are in you. And we don't have to be afraid. We don't have to try to prove anything. We do have to try to be better than another person. Because you love us enough. And because you are with us all the time. Help us to remember this when we feel alone, when we feel afraid, when we feel worried. Help us remember that we can trust in you. And thank you for this honor. Thank you for this precious opportunity to trust in you as our God. We love you, Lord. And thank you so much for everything you've done. In Jesus' name I pray.
