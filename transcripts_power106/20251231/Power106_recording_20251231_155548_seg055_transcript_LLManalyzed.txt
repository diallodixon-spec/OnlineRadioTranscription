20251231 155548 I said, if I, you call me therapy, that's my radio name, if I am spreading propaganda or the Prime Minister is speaking the truth. No man, not Dr Wheatley. The Prime Minister's constituency and you must find Wheatley as the project, the person who supposedly controls the project yes I saw that yeah and then the one in Westmoreland and the last one was in Cartagena Central right so Richard I wanted to ask you now to check your facts and say if I'm speaking the truth and the Prime Minister says something what him don't mean. Enjoy the rest of the day. Richard, and whenever you criticize me, just criticize me truth because the only time I hear Richard come on the radio was the sugar business. But you have to watch Richard.
