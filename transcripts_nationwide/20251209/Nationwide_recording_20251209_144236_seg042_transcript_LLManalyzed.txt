It's the food that's on your feet, it's on your feet Give me a lick, it's the kick of feature I'm, talk about your beauty Your voice in my ears, so soothing Get ass out of me, I'm not losing Baby, can I get a picture of of yourself Love it how you took care of your body, how it held it Faithful from the self and then the selfish As a sight of yours, I'ma have to show you off Watch the diamond glow, you and I will burn In your eyes, let me show you, memories there, Jack
