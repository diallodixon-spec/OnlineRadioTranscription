20251229 171007 demolished homesides across Detroit in the United States may have been backfilled with toxic dirt, raising serious public health concerns in city neighborhoods. Experts say contaminated construction debris, including material from a demolished shopping mall, may contain hazardous substances such as lead, asbestos, mercury, and other toxic chemicals. City officials have confirmed that more than 400 demolition sites are now under review after testing earlier this year found pollution levels above safety thresholds at dozens of locations. Environmental specialists warn that exposure, especially through dust or direct contact, could pose risks to residents, particularly children. Former regulators say the issue may point to failures in oversight and testing protocols designed to prevent contaminated fill from being used. Detroit officials dispute claims of mismanagement, saying the problem was uncovered through city-led investigations and that results will be made public.
