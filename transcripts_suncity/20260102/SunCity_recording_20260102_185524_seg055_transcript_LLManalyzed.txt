20260102 185524 You see this life, know it be so I remember, remember the month of December Don't have been no caring, no tender You rejected my love cause I was broke I've been the end I'll spend my life with you, yeah I've been there begging you to drive, reason with me If I don't get today, I'll go get up tomorrow I'll be your one-make-a-die, you know it's easy for me I'll get up tomorrow
