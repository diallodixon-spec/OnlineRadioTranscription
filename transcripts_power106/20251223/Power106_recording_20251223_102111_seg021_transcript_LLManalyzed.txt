20251223 102111 securities because of the fact that the administration is borrowing on the short end and of course marking up liquidity and they will now have to provide that liquidity to replace that liquidity but at the same time they can't do much. So in turn off markets betting that the Fed will cut rates or betting that they won't based on the GDP number. I mean it might be mislead for markets to bet on that. As mentioned, the Fed might not be inclined to cut based on this number. So it's really a wait and see. Right now, it's more on the fiscal side. What do you think that the administration will do? Because the real problem that the administration is facing, and the dots are not in the administration's favor in terms of the make-up of the House post the midterm election. So it's a wait and see moment. All right, Ferris. Thank you. Thank you very much, Ferris. Thanks for having me.
