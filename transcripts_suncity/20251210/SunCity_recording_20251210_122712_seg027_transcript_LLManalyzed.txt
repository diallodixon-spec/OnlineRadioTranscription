Yeah, I'm dying Every time I reminisce on what we had But still I can't believe it's over I'm trying to make sense of what went wrong And stay strong, hold on, hold on Baby, I'm the one who can love me just right, yeah This a boy who could love you all night, yeah Yes, but you don't want it, you don't want It Every time we're going through the things we go through Why does it need to always come to beg you? I'm just so tired of fighting for you, woo, woo, woo. Me girls here, the love is me. Yeah, we shouldn't fight. I know you don't miss, you want me dying. Baby, me living in all the money. Me locked up in a room. God, we know me a go and talk. If me see you crying, me wish me was you.
