God told me that he's gonna heal you. She said thank you pastor. And her mother just went home. And every Sunday she came to church. Still couldn't walk. A few Sundays ago. Just before we brought the message. And I got some witnesses in here tonight from Mount Calvvin i walked over to her i said god said he's gonna heal you she had not walked in over 10 years she got up and walked across the front of the church. Walk down the aisle. I call the light to tell you, you're next in line for miracles. I don't care what the devil is saying. You're next in line right now. You are next in line.
