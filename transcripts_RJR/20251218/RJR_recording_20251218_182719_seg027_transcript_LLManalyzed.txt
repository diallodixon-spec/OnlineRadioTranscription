20251218 182719 the parish courts we are having matters going to mediation at levels that we've never experienced because people really like what really is important what is life really about so we have set aside egos we've set aside selfish selfishness and we're just really looking to see how it is that we can advance our own interests with the interests of others and and that's what what is coming out of these parishes. I'm telling you, they are like, the spirit of community is alive here. It is alive here. People are looking out for each other, people are looking out for the children. It's highly commendable. We're not giving up. We're not playing victim. I can tell you that we're not playing victim and we're not running, we're not leaving Senti. We're not leaving. We're staying here and we're going to build it back. And I know I can speak for the rest of the West as well. How have you seen that community manifest? How has that shown up?
