There's a number of things I want to talk to you about, but there's only one I can talk to, you know, because I have to run out shorter to go and look about some care package for the hurricane people. I just want to say congratulations to you and the Excelsior team, but most of all. No, man, no, I don't deserve any congratulations in that. Excelsior deserve it. I have nothing to do with it. But most of all, I would like to say congratulations to my team, Eltham High School, because it's the first in decades they have ever been to the semi-final. And I want to tell you and the Excelsior team please, that is only one year
