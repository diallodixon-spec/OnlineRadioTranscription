And during this time, we, you know, we get a little busy on the roads, however scaled down that will be for you this year. Of course, due to the impact of Hurricane Hurricane Melissa I know some people will still be up and down on the road you know buying things or decorating or doing things that we usually do around Christmas time and I want to just remind you I can't tell you how many times I've you know either seen people crying or bawling because of lost money or or theft or whatever it is that usually happens they call it the silly season and so many things
