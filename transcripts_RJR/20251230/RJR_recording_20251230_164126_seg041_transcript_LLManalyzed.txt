20251230 164126 I've been waiting for you, my lady. I'll be on my way to you soon. All through night till morning, don't leave me. Call your work and tell them, but no. Hey, I've been thinking about you daily. Putting you in positions that drive you crazy. My provisions are completely accumulating. See what you're facing. You know this ain't no playtime. This a baby in a playpen. Don't back off when time me regulating. Current a flow direct we alternating. That's why you grow up so bright, you grow with beatings. And I've been waiting for you my lady. I'll be on my way to you soon.
