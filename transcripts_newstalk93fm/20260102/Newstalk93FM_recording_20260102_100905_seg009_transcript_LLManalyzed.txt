20260102 100905 Feel a weight upon my shoulder You're my rescue, you're my remedy Everything about you frees me I relax and take it easy Cause you give me hope, hope. You're like the morning sun and I'm not alone. You give me hope. Hope. You're like a sunrise. No, I'm not afraid. Cause you'll give me hope When I walk on sinking sand Feeling lonely in a crowd When everything's pulling me in every direction
