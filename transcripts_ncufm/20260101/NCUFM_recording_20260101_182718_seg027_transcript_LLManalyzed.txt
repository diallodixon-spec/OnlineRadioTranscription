20260101 182718 When I go for my appointment at the clinic, only to hear that my pressure is high. All right, I got you. I understand. Yvette is saying, Michael, I'm definitely not taking over any stress into 2026, you know. I'm leaving them behind. Thank you. Thank you, Yvette. Thanks for responding. So, Michael, my plan is to leave behind all the hurts and the disappointment and the friendships that were not positive. I want to carry forward, bring forward, move forward with trusting in God and claiming more of His promises. A lot came in after we finished the segment. Good day, Michael, definitely caring over kindness, my relationship with God, and a humble heart, and I want to leave behind all the doubts and the fears that plagued me in 2025. Auntie Sharon, blessings to you. I see you, I see you. And Karen, blessings to you every time. Thank you for making NCUFM your place where you are in this
