20260102 185725 I don't come, I don't comey. Love is not a crime, tell the jury. Mine feel the fame, feel the money, feel the jewelry. Every manna watcha, all you do it. When you're back now, settle on the block now. When your bubble would please, I'll feel locked down. Pretty f pretty now, never flopped down Hot dogs, if I get your friend up in a lockdown Love how you whine, you waste me girl You international Love how you kick on your toe, you're not too normal It's like a carnival Ready when you're ready for your carnival
