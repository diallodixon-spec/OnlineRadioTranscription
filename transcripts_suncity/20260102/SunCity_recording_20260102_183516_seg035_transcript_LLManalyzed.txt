Tell me, could it not matter? See, you want to check if my tap ain't no rush? But see the rush, see the rush, well, well, it be much Now I'm gonna make my tap in the rush We call it money, we did us well in the months. Now I'm gonna make my top, we did us. We got money, we got us. Yeah. We did us. We did us well, well, in the months. We'll be hype. I'm feeling I'm the one.
