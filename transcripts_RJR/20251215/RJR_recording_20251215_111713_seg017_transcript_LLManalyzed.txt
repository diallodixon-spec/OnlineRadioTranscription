20251215 111713 Welcome back, and of course, it's the hotline. And Doc, you don't mind if you tell us your name? Because you're now retired. So is that all right with you? Hello? Hello? Yes, are you hearing me? Hello? Oh, all right. I was just speaking. Can you hold up for me? Let me try and sort this out a bit more. I was speaking to get some feedback on sickle cell. Alright, so I'm not sure if you have Doc, maybe I've lost him. Have we? Doc, are you still there? Okay, see, hopefully he'll call back. He wants me to flesh out a little bit more. Liz, I know you're there. How are you? Welcome. Yes, how are you? I'm good, thanks. What's happening? Okay, the deadly sickle cell, eh? Blood-related, I guess. Um, what I can talk to you about today is the interesting cycle inside the West.
