20260101 161914 Hey, hey. the rumba. Now, friend, friend, check me when you want your remedy. You don't look like you're loving what you need. And if you're weak in irony, come catch up your body for me. Oh, strictly roots and herbs, they cool my nerves and later trouble. Roots and herbs, cool my nerves, watch out that I'm a bird. Hey, me a go, go fiat, I get a twin. And if I cash in on my muscle phone, I'll go see roots and herbs. Cool my nerves, cool my nerves.
