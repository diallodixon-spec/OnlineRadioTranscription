Some time ago in Bethlehem, so the Holy Bible said, Mary's boy child, Jesus Christ, was born on Christmas Day. Hark now, hear the angels sing, a king was born today and man will live forevermore because of christmas day there is boy child jesus was born on Christmas Day. While shepherds watch them walk by night, they see a bright new shining star. They hear a choir sing a song. The music seemed to come from afar.
