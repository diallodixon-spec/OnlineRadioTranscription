While in hospital, she complained of severe abdominal pain, MRI done, it shows gallstone in duct, which requires urgent surgery. Due to her situation, the doctors have suggested she's to have surgery done at UWE but the facility is to be rented at a cost to her of approximately quarter million she cannot afford that so is there anything the ministry can do
