20251218 191912 I'm standing right here in the midst of my tears. Lord, I pledge you to be the Lamb of God. Oh, we thank you for the Lamb. Thank you for the Lamb of God, the precious Lamb of God. Even when I broke, broke your heart. My sleeves tore as ever. But I'm standing right here in the midst of my tears. I claim you to be the love of my life.
