20251223 160205 Limited liability Don't worry If you try all the things I like You could still be shy in the morning So don't feel away You don't like the fast life But look on the bright side girl I go take the blame I just want you come and light it up Just a little whine a little ride now Come and meet me in the truck and we rev it up Say hold it, keep throwing it back Baby, spend time on it.
