============================================================

take the foot off the pedal, so to speak, but the tempo slowed down. But again, just analyzing the game the last couple of days with the staff, including today, there were some really good parts to take away in the beginning of the game. Overall, we weren't really tested defensively at all. I mean, that goes without saying. But in terms of our rest defense and where our players are and in terms of if they were the counter, did we have enough players behind the ball? And, and so those are the things that we looked at as well. See if we had the right balance. Um, and some of it was, was, was, um, off. You can say that to the point if we were tested, it would have been, would have been probably a little bit more challenged, but, but overall our discipline, and I think that's the key, our discipline on both sides of the ball was on point. That is the point, sir. Brilliant. Your response is absolutely brilliant. That is a point you want to make to a listener. Don't be that easy.
