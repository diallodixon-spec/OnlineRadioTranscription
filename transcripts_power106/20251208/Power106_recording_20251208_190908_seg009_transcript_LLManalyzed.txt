Minister without Portfolio and the Minister of Economic Growth and Infrastructure Development with Responsibility for Works, Robert Morgan. And that's where we leave you for The Road this week. Remember to travel safely. I'm Cheryl Johnson Hamilton. Vehicle operators must always use safety devices. Helmets and seatbelts are there to make sure you arrive alive, protecting you against injuries and even death. Since the start of the year, far too many road users have died. Some of these could have been prevented if the victims wore helmets or seatbelts. The New Road Traffic Act will fine persons for not wearing their seatbelt or helmet. So, do yourself a favor. Wear your helmet, use your seatbelt, save money, and stay alive.
