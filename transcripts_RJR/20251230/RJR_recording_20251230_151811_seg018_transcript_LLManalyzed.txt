20251230 151811 I feel it coming I feel it coming baby I feel it coming You are not the single type So baby this is the perfect time I'm just trying to get you high Faded off this touch We don't need a lonely night So baby I can make it right You just gotta let me try To give you what you want You've been scared of love And what it did to you You don't have to run, I know what you can do Just a simple touch and it gets set you free We don't have to rush when you're alone with me
