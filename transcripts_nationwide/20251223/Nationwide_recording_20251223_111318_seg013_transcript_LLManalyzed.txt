20251223 111318 How many pharmacists we have in Jamaica? Well, currently unregistered, I think we have just a little under 1,500 registered pharmacists. And how many do we need? Okay, Cliff, that's a... I just threw my curveball at you. All right. All right. So, what I can tell you is that as we continue to expand pharmacy services, of course, we're going to need more pharmacies. And we do see where more and more private operators are actually setting up pharmacies and expanding locations. So, of course, as we move along, the need will be greater. But so far as it is now, I believe that what the schools are outputting is filling those gaps. And there are two schools, you say? Utech? University of Technology Jamaica and University of the West Indies. Okay. And how long does it take to become a pharmacist?
