20260102 101105 because I, I gotta, I gotta share this before I go into the sad news on the front page of the Gleaner and the Observer. You know, I think it kind of looked pop though. It's like, you know, cause we heard that there wasn't going to be any, um, artists performing, just going to have like, um, basically this jocks playing music. They had a nice little children's, uh, corner UDC put that up from in the day. They were getting rid of the vendors that are usually there on the roadside, no parking on there. I was like, lot of vibe change. So I took a little nap, like about eight o'clock or so. I'm gonna say weird, outside sound so. Just sound different, like a wave of voices and, you know what I'm gonna say? When we go out, they go look. Remember me tell you say, and I'm not exaggerating now, thousand.
