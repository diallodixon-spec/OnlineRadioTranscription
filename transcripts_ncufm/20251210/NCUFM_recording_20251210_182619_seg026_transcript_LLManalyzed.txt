Uh yeah, I look forward to it as it goes there. Marcia Firstly checking out. Yeah. Maxine Anderson. Amen. Bye bye to you. Blessings. Family and friends have a great evening. We're checking out right now. Prayer Power Connection comes up next. You can stay tuned for that. Keep the WhatsApp line busy just like it was. And as I'm checking out right now, going to the library, get some studying in, get some preparation of a presentation, a final presentation tomorrow in another class. And tomorrow should be a very successful day we're praying for. On behalf of my producer Abigail Williams, I'm your driver M-I-C-A-L Michael Forsyth signing out for now saying have a great evening. Good evening to you until we meet again.
