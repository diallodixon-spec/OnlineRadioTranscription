20251222 142520 Ever learning how it's faithful, yeah Grateful, yes, I'm grateful I've been burned, now I'm careful I've always loved you, never, ever Said it's a curse Every time you open your eyes Your greatest possession is life You'll never live this moment twice So stop your stress Everything where you rip while you're inside How could I ever be mad at Jah? None of my prayers have gone unanswered Jah couldn't build a a yard for no one. Life no have nothing for gay to coerce. As sure as the sun go shine. If you're patient enough you're gonna have your time. To burn in jail. Convince your man.
