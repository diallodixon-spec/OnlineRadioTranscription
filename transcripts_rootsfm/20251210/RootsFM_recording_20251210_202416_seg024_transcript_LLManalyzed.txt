============================================================

As we danced to the melody We had so much to share In a flash I was all alone Haunting me once again A dream of simple fantasy That I wished was reality Then you come knocking at my and wait. Relive this dream once more. Oh, what a dream, baby. I see both bed, I see both bed. It just doesn't feel enough. Wished was the end.
