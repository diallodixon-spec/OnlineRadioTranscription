Jamaica's National Cleanup Program is a major government-led initiative, ambitiously launched a mere month after Hurricane Melissa. It's part of a comprehensive recovery strategy for the island, geared at clearing the considerable quantities of debris, all while managing waste, de-bushing and controlling vectors. Needless to say, the task is gargantuan. Hurricane Melissa is the third strongest hurricane produced by Earth. It is the strongest hurricane on record to have hit Jamaica. It caused 4.8 million tons of debris. When you convert that into standard truckloads you're looking at about 450,000 truckloads of debris. Now they have only collected so far 15,000 and that's in the last five weeks. It is an overwhelming task.
