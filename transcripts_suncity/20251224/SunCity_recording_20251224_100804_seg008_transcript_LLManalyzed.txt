20251224 100804 to speak for itself. Rene Astaire. Greetings, one and all. This is Steve Billings, CEO of Sun City 104.9 FM. And I would just like to take this opportunity to wish you all a very Merry Christmas and an even merrier Boxing Day. 2025 has now come to an end and we look forward to the new year, 2026. New beginnings, new possibilities. May all your dreams and aspirations be realized in 2026. It is going to be bigger, better, greater. I look forward to seeing you all as we ensure that Mama Bee dreams stay alive. All right. Thank you so much, Sir Bee. Big up yourself. Merry Christmas when it comes, sir. All the best to you, too. And you are absolutely right.
