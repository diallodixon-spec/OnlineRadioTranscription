What a beautiful afternoon afternoon to miss Beverly Henry Ellis Thank you so much for keeping it locked and all the folks master from Plum Lane I've been seeing the messages. But I've been playing, I've been busy, focused. Howie from New York, and Ian Virtue from, of course, Salt, Coco Salt, Manchester, always locked in. Sister Dales, we gotta go. We gotta go. What a great show. We get enough love, little laughter, little therapy. Yeah, my chest now so heavy again. Over the 16,000, I let it out. And some tips on saving. Yeah, very important. Very important.
