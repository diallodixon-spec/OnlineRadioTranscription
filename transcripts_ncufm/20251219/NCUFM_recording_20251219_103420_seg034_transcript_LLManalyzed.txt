20251219 103420 Christ I'm walking that line to the promised land. Though my feet may often stumble, I will not be down for long. He has called me to commit but my resolution's gone. So insane to clout the vision And it's poison hard to throw I will look back at these challenges Just to see how much I've grown I'll walk in that line I'll never look back
