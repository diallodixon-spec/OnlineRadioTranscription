20260101 113019 I just can't deny It's never changing Can't you hear me? I'm saying I want you for the rest of my life Together forever and ever too fast Together forever we two And don't you know I would move heaven and earth to be together forever with you If they ever get you down, there's always something I can do Because I wouldn't ever want to see you frown I'll always do what's best for you There ain't no mistaking' It's true that we're makin' Something to last for all time It's never changin' Can you hear me? I'm sayin' I want you for the rest of my life Together forever
