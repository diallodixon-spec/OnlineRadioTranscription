20251212 175134 Deep as the blue sea, love me really and truly And even though times will come, no we won't run Just love me, deep as the blue sea, deep as the blue sea. I'll be sea. I said this love is so strong. We won't run. No, no, no, no. This love in me is deep as a blue sea. This love is as deep as can be. Deep as the dark blue.
