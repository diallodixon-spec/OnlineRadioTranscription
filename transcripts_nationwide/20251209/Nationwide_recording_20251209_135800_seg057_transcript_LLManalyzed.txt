That's why I pick up myself cause I'm a real father Never let me son and don't die You have to go feed up, I know the dirty road rough Roof man out the road we see, I drive in a range If them fit, we get a plate of food, that's strange I'm not telling a lie, you feel like you're gonna die any time without a cry That's why we have to pick up meself cause we are rich
