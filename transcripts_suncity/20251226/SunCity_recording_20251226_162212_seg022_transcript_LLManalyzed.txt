20251226 162212 Lookin' at the mirror. Lookin' to the night. Never say you're not done. Touch me to your bone. Yeah, but I'll be done. So, touch me to your bone, will you stay? You're a Taliban shot, but I'm in a room of batters. Touch me to my bone. People, you never go on. Touch me to bone. If a boy gets spanked, that's mad. And it's like a flag. People, you never know what. Trust me Chimba. If a boy get spanked last night, it's like a plague. You know, Chimba, you just have to say, you know, you go, you get up. You know, you got to do what friends do.
