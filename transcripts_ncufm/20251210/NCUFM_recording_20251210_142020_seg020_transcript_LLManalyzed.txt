I gave Him the praise, and nobody else, nobody else. He's giving me cover for my troubles, that is what the Lord has given to me He's given me the earth For my trouble In the presence of my enemy Thou anointest my head Thou an my head! No weapon that fall against me shall prosper. Thou anoint it's my head. I know it my head! Anoint my head!
