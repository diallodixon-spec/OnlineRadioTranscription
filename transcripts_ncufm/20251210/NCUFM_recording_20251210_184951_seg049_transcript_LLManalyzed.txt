If you feel so all alone and your house is not a home, you need someone. Right now, some people are living on a taparlin. They're living under a little shelter. A little shelter, not their house that they built because Melissa stole it away. They're under some shelter to parlaying or something like that. But understand, a setback is a set up for a comeback. This evening, if you find yourself in the midst of negative emotions, If you find yourself feeling desperate, if you find yourself in despair and even depressed, I have some good news for you. Jeremiah
