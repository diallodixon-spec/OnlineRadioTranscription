============================================================

Beautiful day of my life It will be Cause we're born with the will to survive There's a tension you can feel it's everywhere you go In the news you can hear it's on the radio. What's next you could never know. It's unfair. Oh, the system is designed just to scare you, they're my vampires. They're my vampires. Don't suck up our power. Don't suck our power. And don't fuck them no more. Don't fuck them. We set the place. We just can't take no more.
