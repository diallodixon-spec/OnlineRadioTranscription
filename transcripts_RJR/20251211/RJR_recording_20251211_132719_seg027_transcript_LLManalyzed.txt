You all been on the slide Scoping for love In the crowd, I caught your eye You can't have jokes done You can't do this You thought I'd be my even tank You've got your nuts But I be jammed down again, oh Who's who, man, who? Take another look and tell me then Who's who man, who? Who? Silver woman, who? Who's who man who? Fist jump off the curb, did I beg? Who's you man, who?
