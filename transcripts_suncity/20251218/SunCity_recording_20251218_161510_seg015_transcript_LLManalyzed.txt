20251218 161510 I'm grateful for each day you gave me. Maybe I don't know that much, but I know this much is true. I was blessed because I was loved by you. You were my strength when I was blessed because I was loved by you You were my strength when I was weak You were my voice when I couldn't speak You were my eyes when I couldn't see You saw the best there was in me Lifting me up when I couldn't reach You gave me faith cause you believed I'm everything I am Because you loved me You were all I needed
