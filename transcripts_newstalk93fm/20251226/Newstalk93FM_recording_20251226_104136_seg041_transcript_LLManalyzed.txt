20251226 104136 You're a treasure in my eyes. The greatest pleasure in my life. Cause when you're living by the knee, honesty, how it feels, who is where the heart should be. Pretty feathers in disguise. Not together we will rise. So don't you ever let me down again. Cause I'm depending on you, so you better come through this time. Please hear my cry and if I ever let you down my friend, it was a misunderstanding.
