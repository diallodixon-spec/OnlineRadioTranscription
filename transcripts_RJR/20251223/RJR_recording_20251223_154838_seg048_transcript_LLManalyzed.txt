20251223 154838 We don't have no sleigh, but fun we do have at Christmas J.A. So run and come to see your son, it's Christmas J.A.. Snow and sleet you'll never meet at Christmas J. The beaches are nice, much nicer than ice. The rum is still fine, and so is the wine. So run and come to see your son. It's Christmas Day. No one sleeps. You'll never be at Christmas Day.
