20251218 180503 Can't find love because it's trapped inside Can't find freedom lurking with the light. Make some room in this old heart of mine. So much pressure to keep holding on. Pack my clothes up, baby, I'll be down. Start it up. I've got to break it up now. When I think about about tomorrow I can't wait to start it up now Got to shake it up now If I have to beg on my own I don't want to take it anymore
