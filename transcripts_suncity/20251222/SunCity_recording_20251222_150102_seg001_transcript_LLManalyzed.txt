20251222 150102 This Christmas, choose life. As we recover from Hurricane Melissa's devastation, we're reminded that life is fragile. Pedestrians, stay alert. Drivers, slow down. Rest if you're tired, and never drink and drive. One careless decision can change a family forever. Let's have a safe and prayerful Christmas and a cross-free 2026. It's more music, stuff dancing, and less talking. Get your tickets now at Boots & Robbie.
