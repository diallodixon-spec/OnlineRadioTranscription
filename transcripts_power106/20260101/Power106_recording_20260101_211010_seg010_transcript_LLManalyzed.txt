20260101 211010 We go, we break the rockin' pan the stereo A little pizza, bust a high trance Just nice to step on the island, oh lord, oh well Everywhere we go, we trade your rockin' pan' the radio Find a woman, no for wine pan Just nice to step in the island, oh Lord, oh, yeah. So don't bother brookie vibes, we dance tonight down on the gully side. Everywhere we go, we tread the rockin' down the stereo. A little piece of us, the hydrants, just nice to sleep on the island. Oh, land o' wave, everywhere we go, sweet tread your rockin'.
