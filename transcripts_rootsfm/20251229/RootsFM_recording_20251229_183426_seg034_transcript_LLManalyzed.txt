20251229 183426 Gotta be careful of the steps I'm supposed to take. I'm a lover, I don't need no heart to break. No, no, no. Something moved to the left, it got me right. And I said, baby, be mine tonight. Out of all the shortage, I chose you. And if you so desire, we can move. I got my keys left, look in the slide. And I got the rhyme with the leather inside. Guess I got you good, good loving in mind. Christopher, givin' it to you right, babe. Christopher, givein' it. Christopher, give it to you right. Give it to youots 96.1 FM.
