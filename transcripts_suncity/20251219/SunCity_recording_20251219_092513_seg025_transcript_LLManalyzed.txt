So it's a little bit more pricey than I would say the other companies that does the shared service to Montego Bay, Ocho Rios, etc. So if you want that private service, yes, I can give you a quote. I can't believe DJ Stay didn't tell me about this, you know. Anyway, okay, so tell our listeners, you know, where they can go to keep up or if they want to book. How does that work? What's the process? The process of booking is pretty easy. Send me a DM on Fiwi Express, which is F-I-W-I, Fiwi Express Jamaica.
