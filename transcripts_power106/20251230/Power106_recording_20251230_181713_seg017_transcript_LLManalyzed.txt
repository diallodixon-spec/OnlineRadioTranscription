20251230 181713 And we were hoping that in 2025 we would have continued on this very positive upward path. But we ran into two challenges. One, the competition was stronger and we were weaker. We weren't able to pull out all of our good players because of the time of year, unfortunately. And hence we went to Chicago with fewer players than was necessary. That was important to have had. We had about 14, 15 players overall, while the other teams had their full complement of 20. What it means is that you can't rotate as often as you would like, and therefore the players will get tired a little easier. And that was a big problem for us. Quantitatively and qualitatively, were not as good as we were in 2024 and therefore we lost the trophy to Greece which was a new side, a very strong side and notwithstanding when we went to Montreal we played a lot better because we got more war players back.
