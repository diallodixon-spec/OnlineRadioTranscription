20251218 143931 Top of my line And it was yesterday when I saw you down the lane You were my best friend My heart felt the pain And now I'm falling in love all over again I could have ever doubted you were my friend You never miss the ones that tell you well run dry Who do you find it in your heart to give me one? Who apply? I won't abuse the situation This type of whole life For my nightly conversation I'll sew me lullaby Freshest squeeze orange juice On me ends well fried Diamonds well cleaved From me socks to me tie She's a friend also a lover That made me naffish
