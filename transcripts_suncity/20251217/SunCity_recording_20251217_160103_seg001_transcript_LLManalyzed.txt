Buy any Frigidaire item from Singer. Value $30,000 or more plus GCT from December 6th to January 10th, and get a chance to be one of six winners to share $500,000 in prizes. Upgrade your kitchen with our main prizes of a pipe burner, stainless steel stove, or a side-by or IMS-4. Ask your clearing agent to provide your customs declaration, customs assessment notice, and customs receipt once duties and taxes are paid.
