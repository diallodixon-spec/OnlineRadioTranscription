I have Dorothy Campbell here with me from the CAC. We're in school. Dorothy, you're on mic again. Yes, thank you so much, Dr. Taylor. I just wanted to go back. I wanted to give the section of the Consumer Protection Act on the non-delivery of goods or services on a contracted date. It's section 31 under the Act. So I just want the businesses to remember, small, medium enterprises, those who engage in just a delivery service, that once you have committed and signed a contract for a delivery date, if there is a problem, you need to communicate that with your client and come to an agreement as to what, how you would make those adjustments. In terms of the, I'm going back into the repairs and construction for the whole restoration and recovery.
