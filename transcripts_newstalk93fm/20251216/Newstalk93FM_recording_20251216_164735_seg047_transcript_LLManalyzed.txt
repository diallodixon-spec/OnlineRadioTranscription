20251216 164735 O my life, I will do you. Breathe and take my breath away. At your altar, I will pray. You're the sculptor, I'm the clay. O my, my, you're taking me out of the ordinary. I want you laying me down so we're dead and buried. On the edge of your night. Staying drunk on your vibe. The angels up in the clouds. Are jealous, not what we found. So this world is ordinary. You got me kissing the ground. We're the sanctuary. Chatter me what you've done. Oh Lord, return me to dust. The angels up in the clouds are jealous, know what we've found. Something so heavenly, higher than ecstasy, whenever you're next to me.
