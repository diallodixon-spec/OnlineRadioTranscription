20251222 214128 Inside out, oh darling I want it to be so deep that you'll be tearing me Inside out, I want it to so deep that you will miss me When you're lying in her bed And you're in her arms instead of mine, love As you feel her tightening grip like a genie i miss in your heart i won't give up won't give up like the notes here in this song, it'll go on and on and on. I want to love you, yeah. I want to be here inside of you, oh, darling. Oh, I want to be so big that you can be with me inside of me.
