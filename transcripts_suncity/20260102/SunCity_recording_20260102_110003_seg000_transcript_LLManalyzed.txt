20260102 110003 I'm down for you baby No you aren't Can't see what you're telling me again For me, for me, for me In your life, in your life Sun jot near your songs at the Sun Sun jot near your sons at the Sun The one who gave you my heart and soul But it wasn't good enough for you, no So I ask God God send me an angel from the heavens above
