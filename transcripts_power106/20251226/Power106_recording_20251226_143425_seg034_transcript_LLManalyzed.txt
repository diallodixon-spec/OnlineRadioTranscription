20251226 143425 Music! Music! Be sweet as honey, sing like Bumblebee Shaggy's a pretty little woman, sexy as can Be sweet as honey string like Bumblebee It's a summer time, I'm fearing of the atmosphere I'm a lover, I tire on the clothes that she wear Some of them are bundled up, them tired Some of them I try, I don't care Some of them I shine up Some of them I wax up, not a sign of smear Gotta be rolling in my chrisons that the girls them stare This is Shaggy and Raven as your ultimate pair Taking care of our careers, so tell the world beware Cause it's a brand new selection for your musical era
