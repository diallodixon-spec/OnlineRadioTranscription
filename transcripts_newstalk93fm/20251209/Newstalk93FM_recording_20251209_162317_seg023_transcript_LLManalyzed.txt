you saved my heart from the fate of ophelia i could be the twist the one to make you stop the icing on your the cherry on the top There's heaven in my heart and we could find you some space I could be the world to you, the missing piece The extra sentimental kind of chemistry Some people make it hard, but me that isn't case because i think it's so easy to fall in love so come give me a call and we'll fall into us i'm the perfect mix of saturday night
