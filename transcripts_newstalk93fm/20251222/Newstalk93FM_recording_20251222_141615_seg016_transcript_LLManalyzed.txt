My feelings today swing like Django lover. Feelings today swing like Timbani Kaichu I'm a white dog, even if I miss you Why you say I did nothing for you? And if I do anything, you want me to do? Timba n***a, at you At you, at you How my white dog think if I miss you? If I miss you? Why you say I didn't do anything for you? And If I do anything You want me to do Maybe another time, maybe another life You will be my wife and we'll get it right Youngest, last last Now everybody go try breakfast Have to say bye bye yo, bye bye yo To the love after life
