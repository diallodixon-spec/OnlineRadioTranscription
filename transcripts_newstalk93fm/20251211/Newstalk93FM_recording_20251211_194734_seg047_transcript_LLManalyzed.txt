2025-12-12 13:53:00 I feel like a movie. When you throw it back on all our wrongs Welcome to downtown baby And we jammin' dumb dumb dumb dumb It's we at the downtown jammin' And we jammin', dumb dumb dumb dumb Is we at the town jammin' We need a feelin' When you test your situation From since I was small eyes are so common. That type of feeling when you need some motivation. These things just keep coming when I'm in trouble. You'll see when it's all gone, darling. Thinking if I was the jammed tune on it.
