============================================================

Oh, it's not gonna be long Please, don't make it longer I see love from a distance Coming back slowly I know it's gonna last forever I feel our hearts coming closer Closer and closer It's the time we get it together I know you've done a lot of wrongs But I'm willing to forgive No one has the right to decide How we all were made to live Sometimes we should stop and count to ten Before we meet again
