20260101 185751 Can you paint with all the colors of the wind? How high does the sycamore grow? If you cut it down, then you'll never know And you'll never hear the wolf cry to the blue corn moon For whether we're white or copper skin We need to sing with all the voices of the mountain We need to paint with all the colors of the wind You can own the earth and steel All you'll own is Earth county You can paint with all the colors of... the wind
