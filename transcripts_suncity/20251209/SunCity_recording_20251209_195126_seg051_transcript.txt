I promise you will reach your goal Everything takes a little time So just wait a little while I know little time will pray to the most high But patience is the last thing on my mind It takes a little time So just wait a little while I know little time to pray to the most high But patience is the thing on my mind So rocky life's road We living in hell Confined in a place Call that a cell So I'ma shoot behind the bars And no liquor did I, but a weed did a sell Long time in no life, mess up Black on black violence, some white people set up Look pon Mama Africa Look pon the whole of Jamaica No guns never make ya Everything takes a little time So just wait
