20251230 204526 I'm putting one and one together Finding out what kind of plans I might be in All of the time No matter how near I fall I don't let you by my side I see the sun rise up in all its splendor To warm the world until the day is through For then I see you so warm and soft and tender And I know nothing's warm as being next to you
