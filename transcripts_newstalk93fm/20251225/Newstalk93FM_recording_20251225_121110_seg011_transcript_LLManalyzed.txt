20251225 121110 We're not feeling under the weather You just make me feel sweet Ice the cocoa tea, use the sugar I'm talking that we are complete, darling Heat me up Only you alone can put fire back in the soil Heat me up And they're telling me I should leave that fire alone Well the more they tell me is the more I holdin' you close I could never let you go Miss Oshine, Miss Oshine Y'all are comin' home, I will see you again All day through the night, I dreamin' Miss Oshine Where you turn the top, make it smooth, my darlin' When is pouring rain, say put a button on the fire. Poppin' in ya, poppin' in ya poppin' in it over. Raise the temperature higher. Comin' in ya, comin' in ya comin' in closer. Make the thing catch your fire. Spell it all on the ground, all over the counter. With that button on the fire, yeah.
