Don't believe one minute that they are with you, try free the people Over hills and valleys too Don't let them fool you Don't believe for a minute that they are with you Our drugs won't do You're just behaving like they want you to, yeah I say arrogance is much different from ignorance And I know you feel the same way too Many live this life without having a clue No reason why they are so sad and blue Places to go, so much things to do Not a moment to reflect on the cycle
