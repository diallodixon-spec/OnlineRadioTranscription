20251224 122522 but something that I have first-hand experience of what this can, how it can affect people. Australia currently leads the series 3-0. The fourth test will bowl off on December 25 at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. For Stokes, this series hasn't gone according to his team's pre-series plans. We have a goal still to try and achieve out here on this trip. It's not gone anywhere near to plan whatsoever. We've still got two games of cricket to play We've still got a lot of efforts and energies to put in in the remaining others tour and looking after my players is one of the main things that I need to get out of this because we need to go out there and win two games of cricket and I know how this kind of stuff can affect people and as I said I will always protect my players as much as I possibly can and right here right now that is my main job as England captain.
