20251219 194134 I want to ask you a question. In the 90s, when the government needed funding, isn't it true that they used to get majority of the funding from the private capital markets locally? In Jamaica? And I'm trying to have to my recollection, we used to do that, but then that was before the crash, right? Before we were we moved into that timeline which was in the mid to late 90s. In the 90s. Yes. Yes. I'm thinking that even after the situation started to boil in 1995 forward, The government was still going to the local capital market to raise capital for projects at high, very high interest rates. So we used to have a lot of paper floating around, a lot, yes, a lot more than we do now.
