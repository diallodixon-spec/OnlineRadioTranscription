20251226 215541 Shine in my soul today You feel my emptiness inside There's nobody who can take your place For I could never love the same way twice You gave me joy and peace of mind These days Those things are hard to find And to my heart You hold the key Cause only you, cause only you Can, can set me free Your love is deep inside of me So that you can do the things, do the things that you love me Your love is deep
