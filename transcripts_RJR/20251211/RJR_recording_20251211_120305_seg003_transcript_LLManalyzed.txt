have loved vigilance to everything, especially to meat. Minister of Agriculture Floyd Green, he was speaking today on TVJ Smart Jamaica. Discussions have started between the Minister of Agriculture, Floyd Green, and some of the island's butchers who have requested a meeting to outline their concerns with the National Animal Identification and Traceability NAIT system. The butchers, who have also staged a protest and withdrew their service to highlight the issues, say since the system came into being in 2015, many have been facing serious difficulties obtaining tags and significant delays that hinder their ability to serve customers effectively. On Tuesday, they penned a letter addressed to Minister Green requesting a face-to-face meeting on December 17. Speaking today on TVJ Smart Jamaica, Mr. Green said he has since met with two of the butchers and changes will be made to the NAIT system. What we've done at the ministry is to ramp up our tagging processes. So we just started at Blitz.
