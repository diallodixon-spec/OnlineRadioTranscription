2025-12-12 15:39:48 If I ever really gonna let you go And I couldn't even leave my apartment Stripped down, torn up about it Now nothing feels right when I'm not feel you in my bed. Near me, touch me, feel me. And even at the bottom of the sea, I could still hear inside my head. Telling me, touch me.
