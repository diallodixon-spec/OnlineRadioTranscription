**Local Attorneys Debate Decriminalization of Consensual Sex Among Minors**

A heated debate unfolded on the radio program "Beyond the Headlines" with Dionne Jackson Miller, as attorneys Kimberly Whitaker and Shirley Richards discussed the decriminalization of consensual sex among minors. The topic sparked a lively conversation, with both attorneys presenting compelling arguments.

Kimberly Whitaker argued that children should not be criminalized for making mistakes when their hormones are raging, and when there was no force involved. She emphasized that the current law is skewed, putting boys more in conflict with the law, and that counseling is a better avenue for addressing the issue. Whitaker pointed out that the Child Diversion Act, which allows for counseling and diversion, is a move in the right direction, but not all matters get the benefit of diversion due to stigma and parental decisions.

On the other hand, Shirley Richards disagreed, stating that decriminalizing consensual sex among minors would send the wrong message. She argued that the law conveys a message that persons under 16 should not be involved in sexual activity, and that changing the law would be equivalent to liberalizing the system. Richards emphasized that sexual activity can have detrimental effects on children, including the risk of STIs, PID, and infertility, and that a strong message is needed to discourage such behavior.

The debate highlighted the complexities of the issue, with both attorneys acknowledging the need for a holistic approach. While Whitaker emphasized the importance of counseling and diversion, Richards stressed the need for a strong message to discourage sexual activity among minors. The discussion also touched on the disparity in treatment between boys and girls, with boys being more likely to be labeled as sex offenders and face harsher consequences.

As the debate concluded, it was clear that there is no easy solution to this complex issue. However, both attorneys agreed that the current system needs to be examined and rectified to ensure that children are protected and supported. The conversation served as a reminder that hard cases make bad law, and that a nuanced approach is necessary to address the intricacies of consensual sex among minors.
