20251225 123425 So just keep kissing me under the mistletoe Pour out the wine, let's toast and break wood or sand or snow I know there's been pain this year, but it's time to let it go Next year you never know, but now Merry Christmas we'll dance in the kitchen while embers glow We've both known love, but this love we got is the best of all I wish you could see it through my eyes Then you would know My God, you look beautiful Right now, Merry Christmas I feel it when it comes Every year having us carry on Fill up with so much love All the family and friends are together when we all belong Merry Christmas everyone
