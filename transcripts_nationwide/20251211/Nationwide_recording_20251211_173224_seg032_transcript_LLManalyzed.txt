2025-12-11 17:42:00 I was surprised at learning that Grand Slam tried to file for bankruptcy this morning. We had received 50% of the prize money and appearance money as per contract and we were promised in 60 days the additional 50%. As you know, I was an admin supporter of the league and I am surprised and I don't know in the final analysis what actually went wrong, but I am assuming that filing for bankruptcy in some ways protect you from financial payments until the people let you owe money. C. Gobin says it's a shame the league encountered difficulty as it could be a game changer for athletics. Moving forward I think you know these situations have to be thoroughly invested more but I still give credit to Michael Johnson for attempting to do this. I mean 50% of the money that we received was much more
