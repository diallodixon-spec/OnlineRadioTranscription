20251229 182514 more bluntly, the UAE offers a lot of good opportunities. And I think a number of teachers have come across, pilots, people who work in the oil and gas sector, a lot of Jamaicans in the hotel industry. So because UAE is a growth environment, they demand labor from all around the world. And as long as you're competent, this is a space where people find that they can actually excel in their careers. And I believe Jamaicans, we're looking for opportunity. And it doesn't matter how far flung that opportunity is, people are coming across to take those. So yeah, the growth is because of the opportunities that exist here in the UAE. In terms of your teaching in the universities, what kind of differences did you experience or notice between that experience as opposed to our colleges here?
