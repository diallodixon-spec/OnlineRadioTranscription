I get in both for my hold up. I make your body slow and I slow down. Put it on your load, no go loud down. You know the things I wanna do tonight. Unusual. Put it down, make it take away your peace of mind. You gon' flow like water when you get the freeze up light. Open your eyes and look. Look what the hot body can do. I see blue, blue, blue. Focus. Look what the body can do.
