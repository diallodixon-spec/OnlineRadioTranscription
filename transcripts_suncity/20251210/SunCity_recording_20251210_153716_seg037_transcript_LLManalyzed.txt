Now that I found you, please be true Said I'd never been lonely And I'd never been blue Now that I've found you I searched heaven and earth for this girl I've been searching the whole wide world Sanchez, are you looking for the perfect girl? Yes, the perfect one who's gonna brighten up my world Oh man, you want the past tense and you want the present Yes I feel blue, wet be true So I'd never be lonely
