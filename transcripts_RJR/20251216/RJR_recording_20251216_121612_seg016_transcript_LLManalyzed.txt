20251216 121612 women's football title at the defeat in the University of the West Indies in the final 3-1. Akela Marsh in the 23rd minute, Captain Abigail Mullins in the 44th and Tayceena Clark in the 76th minute, scored for G.C. Foster. Kaitlyn Sam scored U.S. consolation in the 39th minute. West Indies batting coach Floyd Reifers says the team must improve its ability to maintain control for longer periods, particularly with a bat as they prepare for the third test against New Zealand. Reflecting on the opening two matches of the series, Reefer said the carbon side had repeatedly placed themselves in strong positions only enough periods of times, especially in the batting department where we put ourselves in good positions and they never really continued. So going into this game, that's something that we spoke about and it's something that we want to improve on in terms of where we control the situation.
