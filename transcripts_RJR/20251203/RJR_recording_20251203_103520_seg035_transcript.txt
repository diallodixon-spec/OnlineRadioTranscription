What's going on? I have high blood pressure and I went to the clinic on Monday, first Monday, and it's a lot of us. And come to know, to hear the nurse come and say, no, doctor not coming because we don't have any light or we don't have water. And we have to go back home without any prescription. And some elderly, more older than me, they have high blood pressure, diabetes, they don't have any medication, they have to go somewhere else. They have water on the back but no pump to pump up, no current to pump up the water for the doctor.
