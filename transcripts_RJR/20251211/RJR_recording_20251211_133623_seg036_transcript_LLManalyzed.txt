cards and payment. Hi, Valana. Thank you for speaking with us today. Hi, thank you for having me. So, you brought the Sagicor back, Kingston Biz Fair back. Tell me a little bit about what's new this year and what do you have in store for us? Well, we brought it back because we thought it was important to give the SME, our SME clients a good platform for showcasing their goods for this Christmas. What's new is we have more booths available. We have more variety of the products that are available. We have food, we have clothes, we have variety. We have a farmer's market. I've seen a brewery here so far and we have even a hardware store. Yes, yes, yes, yes. It's such a wide variety. I was saying that on air. Why was it so important to bring it back? Could you tell us what the Sgt. Corbett Kingston base fair means for the bank and for the SMEs that are involved?
