20260101 202016 I was drawn to what I could not understand And for the cause of Christ I have spent my days believing That what He'd have me be is who I am As I've come to see the weaker side of me I've realized His grace is what I'll need When sin demanded justice for my soul Mercy said, I'm not gonna let you go. I'm not going to let you slip away. You don't have to be afraid. Mercy said no.
