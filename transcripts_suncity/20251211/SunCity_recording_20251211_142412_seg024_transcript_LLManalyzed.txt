============================================================

When I look in your eyes I know love is blind but the heart doesn't lie I'll ask one more time, maybe this time you'll try So tell me now what's deep in you I care, I care about you I'm there for you So why don't you care for me? Like I care about you Girl, I care about you, I'm there for you So why don't you care for me? Like I care about you I'll spend like all of my days
