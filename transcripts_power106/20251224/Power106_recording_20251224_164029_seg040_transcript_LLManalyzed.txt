20251224 164029 The vibes around the place was good. And by the way, thanks so much to the chairman of the RJR Greener Communications Group, Joseph Matalan and board director Douglas O'Rain for passing through today. Shaking hands, meeting the people, finding out a bit more about the inner workings of not only 4106 FM and not only the radar division, but they did quite a comprehensive tour of the entire plant here at 32 Lindhurst Road. Both guys are very enthusiastic, shook every hand that they came across, and really brought a good vibe in the place. Thanks so much to both esteemed gentlemen, Joseph Matalan and Douglas Array, passing through and showing some love.
