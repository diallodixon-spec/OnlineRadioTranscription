20251219 122419 Give me that love, give me peace of mind Don't show they got me reach all these lines I want that peace of mind Where they go out with that wood Baby, now on my wrist, we they run. So make you not always die. Oh, no. No pressure. Make you give me that love. If you give me me, I'm not gonna let go. Make me give me, make a girl my zanko. Feelings got me hitting on the freaky-dance floor. Diallo, diallo. If I give you my love, make you not disappointed.
