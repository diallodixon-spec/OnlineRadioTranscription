All right. Out of time in our own national surfing champion, Eddie Sharma Bedford. Thank you very much, sir. It was a very informative presentation. I advise you to be much smarter and you can look out and follow your progress as you go forward. Thanks for being on the show. Yeah, thank you so much for having me. Bless up everybody that's listening and, you know, just get the kids out there surfing and come enjoy the beach. That's it to you. It was very inspirational. Thank you very much indeed.
