Clark was sentenced to 30 years for murder, 4 years and 11 months for simple larceny, and 2 years for preventing the lawful and decent burial of a corpse. These sentences are to run concurrently, with 6 months already served deducted. Justice Ty Powell said that while a life sentence was legally available, a determinate sentence was more appropriate. Clark was unanimously found guilty by a seven-member jury in October on charges of murder, larceny, and preventing the lawful burial of a corpse. During the trial, Clark claimed self-defense, alleging that Roane made sexual advances but prosecutors rejected the claim, presenting evidence of deliberate planning and action after the killing. Roane, General Manager of New Era Fencing and Property Services, was reported missing on October 17, 2018.
