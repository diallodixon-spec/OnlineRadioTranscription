20251226 132415 I'm tired of giving my love and getting nowhere, nowhere. What I need is somebody who really cares. I really need a lover, a lover that wants to be there. It's been so long since I've touched a haunting hand I can't put my love on the line That I hope you understand So baby if you want me You've got to show me love Words aren't so easy to say, oh You've gotta show me love
