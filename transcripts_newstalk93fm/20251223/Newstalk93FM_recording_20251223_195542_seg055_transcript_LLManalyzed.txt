20251223 195542 I'll be better on my own, I'll better on my own. Nobody should call my phone, nobody should call my phone. This is my last heartbreak song, this is worse When I'm gone, I'll make you nervous If you hurt me, I deserve it I've been acting foolishly Forgetting what you are You start loving me, I know this But even chaos serves a purpose It feels good to love somebody And somebody loves you back So don't give in to your dreams, boy
