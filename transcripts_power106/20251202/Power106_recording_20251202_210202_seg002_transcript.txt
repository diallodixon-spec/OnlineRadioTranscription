It's Power Talk, identifying challenges and finding solutions in off from each other. For decades, the RGR Gleaner Communications Group has answered the call in times of crisis. Through the RG Cares Foundation, that spirit of compassion continues. We invite you to stand with us and support our brothers and sisters in need. Please donate bottled water, canned foods, other non-perishable items and personal hygiene products. Items can be dropped off at our partner churches, Webster United, Hope United, Meadowbrook United and Portmore United between 9 a.m. and 3 p.m. Mondays through Saturdays.
