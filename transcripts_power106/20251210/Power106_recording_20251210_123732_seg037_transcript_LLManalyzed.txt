July will make eight years that we stop smoking after 52 years of smoking. How it feel? You will still feel for a cigarette. Occasionally, just weirdly. When you smoke, you have certain triggers that make you want to smoke. Say, for instance, if the phone rings, I would normally light the cigarette before I answer the phone. Or after you drink tea in the morning. Yeah, well, some people have to smoke when they drink. That was never my situation. I could drink a beer and don't have to smoke a cigarette. But like after tea in the morning or after meal, that's wonderful. So every now and then you just feel it.
