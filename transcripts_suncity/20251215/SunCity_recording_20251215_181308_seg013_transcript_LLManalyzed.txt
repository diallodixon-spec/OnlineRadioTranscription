20251215 181308 I'm collecting money as a gift. Claudette says, TJ, we love you. Coming from Claudette over there in Central Village. Omari, big up yourself. Omari, I dare you to laugh. No, seriously. Why am I telling you now? Why am I tell you? You hear me? You see, under the Christmas tree, just throw down some money under the Christmas tree. You don't have to bust your brain, just throw down. Apparently, everybody's okay with getting money for Christmas, you know? You can't get money any other day, you know? But on Christmas, it's a special occasion. It's like on Valentine's Day, it's special occasion on your anniversary. These are special occasions. You can give people money for a birthday as a birthday gift for christmas let's continue with the music yeah all right
