20260101 122616 I'm gonna meet the city and greet him in a flow Sing a happy song and tell the glad story Walk all around, talk all around the streets of hope I'm but a stranger here, I'm going home Someday I'll take my flight Home sweet home And with the lights of dawn I'll sing redemption song For now I'll overcome I'm going home
