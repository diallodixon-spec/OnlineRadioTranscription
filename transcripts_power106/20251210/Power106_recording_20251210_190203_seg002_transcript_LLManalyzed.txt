Stay tuned. The Jamaica Council for Persons with Disabilities, JCPD, has been front and center in the relief and recovery effort, ensuring persons with disabilities receive much needed help. Executive Director Dr. Christine Hendricks says the council was out of the blocks early, responding with 100 care packages in St. Elizabeth three days following the hurricane. Since then, the JCPD has visited Westmoreland, Trelawny, other parts of St. Elizabeth, Manchester and Hanover to provide support and conduct household damage assessments. Among the impacts suffered are damaged and destroyed homes, farms and businesses.
