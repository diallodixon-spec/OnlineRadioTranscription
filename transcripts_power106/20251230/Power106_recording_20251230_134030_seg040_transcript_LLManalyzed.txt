It's all mind-boggling, right? And I told you about Malaysia. You can tell the Jamaican people where you find Malaysia. By the way, how far Malaysia is from Jamaica? How far? Well, it's Asia, so it's far. It's very far. It's probably closer, not probably, it's closer to Australia, which is very far from us. These are countries in the East. Is it closer to Japan too? Yes, yes, yes. Because Japan has a whole Asian belt, yes. It's closer to Japan. But the people in the East are a bit different from us, you know. They're not as corrupt as we are.
