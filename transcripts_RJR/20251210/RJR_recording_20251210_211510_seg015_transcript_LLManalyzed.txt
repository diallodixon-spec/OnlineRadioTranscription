============================================================

We all can tell, many have lost themselves From pushing the pit of hell Seattle gone with them souls Get a youth, we can't give up the fight We have to make it out, although Terry lost the time The rules are made for all, but for them he don't apply All we get is gold box with jacket and tie Now the pastor boy will tell you about mansion in the sky. Lose your six cents, my brother, and read between the lines dust. Protect your life but you're serious. You would not be the last and you would not be the first. Gets allowed by some people you trust. Enough people vanish when mysterious.
