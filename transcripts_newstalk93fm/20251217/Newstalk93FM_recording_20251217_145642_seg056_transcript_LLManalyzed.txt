20251217 145642 For the past month, I have been experiencing service disruptions with my Flow internet since the passage of Hurricane Melissa. I'm confused why this is the case, although my friend in another district of my parish is receiving strong mobile service. I can't take this anymore because I need my phone to run my delivery business. I understand how frustrating this is, especially when your livelihood depends on staying connected. Since Hurricane Melissa, the telecoms networks of the major providers have been affected by damaged cables, infrastructure issues, and power problems. So even neighboring communities can experience very different service levels. You should also contact Flow to get an update on service restoration to your area. We strongly recommend that this be done in writing, whether via email, social media direct message or their WhatsApp number.
