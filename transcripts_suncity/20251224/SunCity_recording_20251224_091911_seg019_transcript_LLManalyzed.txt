20251224 091911 little bit more on the scripture okay so we're reading today from Isaiah chapter 9 and verse 6 but before we get into that yes the text we want to look at if Jesus was prophesied to come and Isaiah verse chapter 9 verse 6 is a prophetic word given by Isaiah because he knew what was written in Genesis chapter 3 and in verse 15 it says when Adam and Eve sinned the word of God says I will put enmity between you and the woman and between your offspring and her offspring he shall bruise your head and you shall bruise his heel. This is what God spoke to Adam and Eve after they had sinned so that they would know that someone is coming to regain authority, dominion, and power back and give it back to humanity.
