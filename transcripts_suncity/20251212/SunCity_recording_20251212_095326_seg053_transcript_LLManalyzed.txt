We work with them on their voice and speech, their presentations, their musical selections, understanding the songs that they're playing. And we also will work with them if they are not as sharp. We will work with them. We let them know that if this is your passion, you can fulfill it without feeling ostracized. And at the same time, we want to also implore them to make sure that they understand the importance of having an education, because music also has the educational side to it. They have to understand the management. They have to also understand the media aspect of it, how to present themselves, how they show up and how they show out. So we're teaching them how to be responsible. And I want to say to any young district out there, if you have the talent and you have the passion and you have the drive, we will work with you. We will help you. We will get you out there. And let me tell you, it is just an amazing competition.
