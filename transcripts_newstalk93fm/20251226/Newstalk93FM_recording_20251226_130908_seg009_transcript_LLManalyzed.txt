20251226 130908 It's too many women I like you too I've been patient And I've been waiting Call me stubborn, but I can't get over it You left and never said goodbye Those tears I cried, no, I can get over it So don't you ever let me down again. Because I'm depending on you. So you better come through this time. Please hear my cry. And if I ever let you down, my friend, it was a mistake.
