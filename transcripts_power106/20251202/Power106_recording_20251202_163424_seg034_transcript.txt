Some of us have had to learn how to just slow things down and go at a different pace. Yes, we need to undertake tasks, we need to get things done, but at the same time, we also have to be conscious about living our lives in such a way that we don't run ourselves into the ground. And that's what I mean about taking it slow and steady so that you enjoy each moment that life offers to you.
