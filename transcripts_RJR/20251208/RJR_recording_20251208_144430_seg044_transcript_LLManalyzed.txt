after the tumor board came together from all over. It's a rare condition called fibromatosis. It's actually tumors that grows from the chest wall. So it wasn't the breast that was the problem, the issue. It was actually the muscles in the chest. It was growing from there, invading everything in its path. I thought it was just two ribs, but it was, I saw five on the report and then when I look again on another report It was actually seven ribs that they removed and abreast. So I did a mastectomy as well Because the lump invaded your whole ring. Oh, yes Wow, we're gonna take a break Okay, we come back we'll talk some more. Sidani Blackwood is with me.
