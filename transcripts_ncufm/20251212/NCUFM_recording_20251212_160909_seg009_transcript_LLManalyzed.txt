20251212 160909 will pray as they celebrate. God will cover them and bless their union but it may be bright and fruitful and that they will enjoy to the max with enough love and blessings. Cheers to another year celebrants. Happy Sabbath to all my St. John's Day church family. God's willing, we'll be meeting up tomorrow. Happy Sabbath to all my drive-time families and all 70 Adventist families around the world. Those who celebrate on Sunday, who worship on Sunday, happy worship day to you also. Have an awesome weekend, family, and blessings, galore.
