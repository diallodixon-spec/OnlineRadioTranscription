20251226 115436 She's been a hidden doubt of loving And she says she must confess She's been used and abused But there's no more time to lose Oh no! Because she want a good life No man to cause her pain and strife Since she want a good live No man to cause pain and strife She don't want no unsteady relationship One way a rock like a rocking ship One life as steady as can be One that brings back memory She want a good life, no man to cause her pain and strife She want a good life No one to cross your pain and strife
