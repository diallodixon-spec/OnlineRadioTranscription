20251223 163527 I can't shoot them anymore When the long black cloud is coming down, yeah I feel I'm a-knocking on Heaven's door And right now Knock, knock, knocking on a heaven's door. Somebody please, knock, knock, knock. Somebody please, take this gun off of me. Knock, knock, knockin' on a heaven's store. Knock, knock knocking on a heaven store.
