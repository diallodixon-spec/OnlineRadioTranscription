God continues with his instructions to Moses and Aaron. He said to them, when Pharaoh speaks to you and says, prove yourselves, perform a miracle, then tell Aaron, take your staff and throw it down in front of Pharaoh. It will turn into a snake. Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh and did what God commanded. Aaron threw his staff down in front of Pharaoh and his servants and it turned into a snake. Pharaoh called in his wise men and sorcerers. The magicians of Egypt did the same thing by their spells. Each man threw down his staff and they all turned into snakes. But Aaron's staff swallowed their staffs. Exodus 7 verses 8 to 12
