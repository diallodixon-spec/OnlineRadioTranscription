20251225 131411 I see you all day, through the night, I dream it. Where you turn it up, make it smooth, my darling. When outside is pouring rain, say put a button on the fire. Raise the temperature higher. Coming in, you're coming in. You're coming in closer. Make the thing catch cocoa tea, use the sugar And together we are complete, darling Said I'm falling, falling, I'm falling As I lay my bed with my head to the ceiling Say I'm drowning alone
