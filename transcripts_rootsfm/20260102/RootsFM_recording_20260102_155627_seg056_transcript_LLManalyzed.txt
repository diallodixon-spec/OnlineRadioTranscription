20260102 155627 Baby I don't wanna know the reason why Lately you don't talk to me Darling I can't see me in your eyes Oh baby I hold you near but you're so far away It's losing you I can't believe Watch you leave and let this feeling die I don't want my love to die So don't throw it all away, I love my love Don't throw it away, I love You live the life you love You love the life you love. You love the life you live. Everything you have in mind, I will give away. Three things I bring from time to time.
