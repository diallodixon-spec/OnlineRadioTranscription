For over 43 years, we have weathered many storms together, always challenging us to rebuild, reimagine, and renew our resilient spirit. As we prepare to build back better, Petrojam will be the energy that moves all of us forward. Jamaica, let's stay hopeful. Let's support each other, and let's restore the rhythm of our island home. And remember to support Jamaica's relief efforts at supportjamaica.gov.jm. Petrojam. Serving Jamaica's energy needs. It is exactly one o'clock. You're in tune to Roots FM 96.1 on the FM band as we segue right into the must-bust segment Go Innocent. You know, we always start out with that one, so let's go. All the people of Westman, we play this one especially for you.
