20260102 105340 Yeah, he's an amazing human being. As I listened to the interview and as you said, you know, blood runs through all of us. I didn't get the sense that he was at all bitter or angry. And that's remarkable because he really did suffer a lot of abuse, a lot. But I didn't get a sense from that interview that he was bitter in any way. And I think that's really commendable. So good on him yes very he's very good on him and just like the prime minister just like the prime minster the man holding ground even though we out here as his supporter and his foot soldier are begging the prime minister come out Mr Owlens come and say something let me ask you something Fox let me ask you some because because I remember in the lead up to the election you know when the Prime Minister was taking all the hits and I think he was on election when he was calling the election and the night he called the election
