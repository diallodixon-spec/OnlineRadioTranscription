Wait now, wait now Got you so high that you can't come down, come down Don't you ask, you know you're allowed, allowed When it's you, I can't say no Baby, give me love You got me like oh whoa, whoa, whoa. She got me. Whoa, whoa, oh, whoa. I said, it's my house. I said, we got to smoke. We got to smoke. As me, I wake up. Now, she did my mind. She did my mind. Then one day, two, one of you four call us. Now, so me, I call out. If I leave then you say you can never love again
