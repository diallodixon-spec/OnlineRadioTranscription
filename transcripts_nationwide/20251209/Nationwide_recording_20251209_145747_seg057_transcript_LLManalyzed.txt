The one thing you got to do is Make me believe you When you're lying, lying, lying Make me believe you Baby, all you have to do is try Make me a hit and run I did only one little dealin' Hope you did a look, you must've done I'm a hit and run, I'm a hit-and-run Ay, my youth, you take it too serious Me a little, just a little Now you take a set up on me, I eat up Give me space, give me room to my liquor, freeze now Jesus, how I make you feel so? Through me keep it, tell me ever clean so Want me, did want ya, me never need ya This enough if people know, keep it pan a dealer Me too young, feel like done with nobody I pray one day
