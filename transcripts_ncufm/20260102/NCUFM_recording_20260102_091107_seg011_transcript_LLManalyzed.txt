20260102 091107 The change is coming but until then, don't be jumping to conclusions. God can't fix it, God won't do it real one. They know this fight is only for a season. So cry. Cry now. Know this moment won't define your heart. Don't be jumping to confusions. God can't think that God won't do a real one. We don't want to stand up. We know this fight is for a season. Just for a moment. So cry. Just know this moment won't be by your side. Yes.
