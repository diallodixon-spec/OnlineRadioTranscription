I'm something that was so meant to be with you Forever with the promise in our hearts Now more and more I wonder where you are Do I have cross your mind in time? Do you ever wake up reaching out for me? Do I ever cross you mind in time, I'll miss you. 7, 6, 8. Radio with a difference. With a difference. Still have your picture in frame.
