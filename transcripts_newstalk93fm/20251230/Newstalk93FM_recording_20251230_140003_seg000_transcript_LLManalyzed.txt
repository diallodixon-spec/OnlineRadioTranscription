20251230 140003 You're listening to Sleek Radio, 93 FM. I have a lime in spirit Early in the morning I hat it Me cooler ready, me ice done ready Me punching that's automatic I have a liming jumbie A kind of energy inside me And it ready for the rum Ready, ready for the rum, ready, ready for the action A spiritual encounter Kid my soul taking over Telling me to start up the drinking And do away with good behaviour So we out on the road now BOOM! It's Mars and Riddim and Sulker And I'm ready for the rum, ready ready for the rum. Ready ready for the rum ready for the action BOOM! Wo yo yo yo yo Yo yo yo yo yo This sweating spirit of me feeling good
