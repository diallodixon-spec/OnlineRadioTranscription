============================================================

how do you recognize when we're settling for what's comfortable instead of what has been assigned to us by God? there's there's no reaching for anything more there is it's just the thing. You cannot build faith. You cannot do anything worthwhile going through the mundane, the monotonous, just playing it safe. What is in that that is great? Because you aren't doing anything that is out of the ordinary. And you know what's funny? Most of the times, people don't stretch outside of the comfort zone because of well fear but mostly because of criticisms and I'm here to tell you that one true way for you to not achieve anything is to be worried about what people have to say you're not going to achieve anything
