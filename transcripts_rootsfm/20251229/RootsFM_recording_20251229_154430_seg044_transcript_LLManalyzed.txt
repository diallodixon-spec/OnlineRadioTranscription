One more time, I'll show you I care Oh, don't hurt my feelings Don't, don't, don't do that to me Saw you yesterday, you were hiding in a corner Wanna know why Didn't believe my eyes that you would come on up My friends all say that you are shy I wanna know the reason reason why. Don't need to talk that right now, gonna show you I love you. Only promise me you won't. Ooh, ooh, don't hurt my feeling. Don't do that to me now darling. Ooh, ooh don't hurt my feelings.
