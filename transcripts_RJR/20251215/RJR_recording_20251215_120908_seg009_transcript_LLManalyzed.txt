20251215 120908 Mayor of Montigue Bay and Chairman of the St. James Municipal Corporation Richard Vernon. Prime Minister Dr. Andrew Holness says the government is taking a closer look at how state-owned lands are organized and used with the aim of supporting structured communities while protecting key agricultural areas. Speaking at a land titling ceremony at the Lacovia Community and Centre in St. Elizabeth over the weekend, Dr. Holness disclosed that there is a deliberate effort now being pursued to bring government-owned lands under a single portfolio for review. He explains that several agencies currently hold lands and careful planning is needed to determine how these assets may be better utilized. Dr. Holness says the National Land Agency has already identified several thousand acres of land, including zoned lots, that can form part of this process. I have given a directive now for a couple of years to the National Land Agency, the Ministry of Agriculture, the Sugar Company of Jamaica, and all the other companies that hold government land.
