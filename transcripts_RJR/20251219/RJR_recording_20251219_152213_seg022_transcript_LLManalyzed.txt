20251219 152213 in. Partnering with Barita allows us to use our network to support in a meaningful cause, especially, you know, one that's geared towards children. Absolutely, because I know that FESCO especially does a lot for our children. So, I'm listening, I want to donate, where should I go? Where should listeners go to donate? We are encouraging everyone to come out in their numbers to Fesco Beachwood Avenue this Friday. With additional donations also accepted at our new location on Spanish Town Road. Okay, so you heard that guys. If you head to Spanish Town Road as well, if you're on Spanish Town Road now, just turn right into Fesco. They got barrels waiting on you. All right, I'm turning in, but what time can I donate, Howard? We are going to be accepting these donations from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. at both locations today. All right so 10 a.m to 5 pm you come on hit down here to Beechwood Avenue and you can also go to Spanish Down Road and we are accepting donations there. Anything else
