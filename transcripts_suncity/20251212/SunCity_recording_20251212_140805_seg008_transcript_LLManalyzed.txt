20251212 140805 We find you all the time Don't you be afraid Just work harder And work smarter You will be okay You better don't go astray no day Alright then Get your youth set goals for yourself Dream can be reality Go for your wealth But don't forget about your health And never ever put your talent on a shelf In a survival I've got a black belt The system upheld all the pain you felt When sunshine meets sun, ain't nothin' can't melt Corrum them with precision and stealth Light shows your might Make lemonade They fight you all the time Don't be afraid, just work hard And work smarter, it will be okay
