20251225 103324 I'll be around, give me a chance Cause I'm singing for you every show Can I? How can it be? Can I? I'm in so deep Can I? It's hard to believe This world brought you to me I've been to Paris, London, L.A. I've felt the tropical sun on my face This Christmas we don't need to get away, get away Cause our love is like a holiday I'm always calling from a different hotel room And your voice makes me feel like home Backstreet, I'm waiting just thinking about you
