Whatever you've gone through, I know of mothers that have died of a broken heart. I know of fathers that have died with a broken heart I know children that are not well because they have a broken heart. And they just can't take it and they give up. Well, I don't really understand this, but I know that every broken heart, Jesus Christ bore that on the cross. He carried every pain that I've ever suffered and that I will ever suffer. Every heartache that you've had, He bore it and will bear for you. No one is a friend like Jesus.
