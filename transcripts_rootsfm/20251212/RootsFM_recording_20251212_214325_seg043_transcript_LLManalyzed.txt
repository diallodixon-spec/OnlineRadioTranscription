20251212 214325 I'm so solid as a rock, and they just can't stop me now. Even when they send their traps, they can't just stop me now. People will say this and that, they just can't stop me now. People will say this and that. They just can't Stop me now. People when they set up roadblocks. They just cant stop me now. So they can't keep a good man down. Always keep a smile when they want me to frown. Keep the vibes and dice to my crown. They will never ever take my crown. Who's the place I say no man curse? Things getting better when they thought it would be worse.
