20251215 173522 I'm losing you, baby. My heart would be in pain, and my life in misery. Baby, can you see, baby? All we need, all we need, baby. A little understanding, a little understanding All we need baby A little understanding A little understanding Love gets sweeter after the fight i'm not perfect i'm not always right like the sun we could shine so bright baby you've been oh baby baby
