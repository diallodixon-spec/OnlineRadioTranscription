The woman could cook, she knew it. So the butcher would do killing of the meats on a Saturday or a Friday. And then they would go and they would buy what to make pot roast and the bone section to make soup. And let me tell you something, you know, the patroke was for Sunday, you know, Sunday's dinner. Beef soup was for Saturday, but my grandfather being the head of the house, you know, he had to, my grandmother had to, she seasoned brown some for him, you know, fancy really, you know, pretty words we hear now.
