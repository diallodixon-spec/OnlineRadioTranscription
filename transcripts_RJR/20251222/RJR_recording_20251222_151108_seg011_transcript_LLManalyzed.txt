20251222 151108 backlist me, I don't care, I tell you no lie. No, listen, no man, no reason to be ashamed of anything, you know? Like I tell the people, you know, you oftentimes, it's not about you, you don't know that you're gonna be coming from where you're coming from, you know what I mean? It's not your decision to be born there or come from there, but that has nothing to do with your future You know or the caliber of person that you are or from the family that you are because listen I know some great people that live in inner-city communities. Yeah pillar pillars of the community Yeah, and I mean and without those persons in the community that community would just condemn it because you know what I mean? No, man I know some people that you hope that they stay because literally they are the bedrock of those communities and without them everything will fall apart like Cheney and Chibi would say things fall apart right yeah trust me mmm so big up to all the community
