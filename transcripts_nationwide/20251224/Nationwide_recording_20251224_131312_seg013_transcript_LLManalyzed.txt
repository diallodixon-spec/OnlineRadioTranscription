It is Anything Goes Wednesday. And of course, it's Christmas Eve, that time of the year. Shout out to everybody getting ready, getting ready for later on, you know, going market. Shout out to all the kids and the parents, you know, getting the kids ready. Yeah, man. Mmm. Everybody good old days, man, I tell you. Of course, I got your ears on till 3 p.m. It is Wednesday, you know, till the way I mix up everything, you know. But first and foremost, we have to kickstart it with some, you know, crime-free Christmas songs.
