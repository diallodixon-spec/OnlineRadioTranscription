20260101 094830 It's so easy to fall in love with the way I do my hair, the way I make you laugh, the way we like to share a walk in Central Park. I could be fresh air, might be the girl of your dreams. There's no need to hide if you're into me, cause I'm into you quite intimately. Maybe one could turn into three. Well, I'm gonna see. It's so easy to fall in love. So come give me a call and we'll fall into love on a perfect mix of saturday night and the rest of your life and even one with a heart would agree it's so easy
