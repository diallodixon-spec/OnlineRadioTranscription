20251212 203420 Oh, baby, tearing me apart, breaking my heart. There were times that I didn't show just how much I felt you tight. Felt you close to me. They played your favorite song of mine. Night of melody. Like pumpkin in soup, you blew to me. So embrace this one From the moment I lost eyes on you I knew I'd be having fun Can I have another date with you? And can we spend the whole night true? I'm so happy
