I'm unable to go to the office in Mandeville because of illness. I'm in the Carries District in Laringdon. So, the Carries District, the person said, listen, I don't have the internet. And I said, okay, in October, end of October, boy, I don't know, it's difficult, you know. I remember now the internet is very critical. It's not just about making connections. Persons connect for work, yes, and other, other reasons. So flow, I know it's difficult out there, but at least communicate to the people so they can know what to expect. This one says good morning. I've been listening to the local minister and that he's given a homeless on until the end of this month to vacate the shelter at Petersfield High. I didn't hear him address the issues of suitable arrangements. The issue of land ownership and land security is most important for the way forward in Westmoreland, confirmed Dave in New York.
