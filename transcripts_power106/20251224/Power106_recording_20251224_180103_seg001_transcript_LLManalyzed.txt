20251224 180103 that is a holiday in the United States. I was aware of that. There are very many places where you would see that. As I said, program power play on Mondays to Fridays from 6 to 8 p.m. Only on this station for 106 FM, the digital sound. We all do scan and in the content, we present sporting matters, sporting issues for your information as well as for your entertainment. We, of course, give you features. In our format, we speak to administrators, we speak to coaches, and the athletes themselves participate locally and internationally. And, of course, we speak to the officials. Those are umpires, referees, and other officials doing a great job across the globe, particularly in the professional era, or the expanded professional era when it starts to matter seriously in a financial sense. All right, so we have the Christmas Eve edition, which means that it will more resemble the Friday edition. We'll be looking at football, in the Premier League football, a little later on.
