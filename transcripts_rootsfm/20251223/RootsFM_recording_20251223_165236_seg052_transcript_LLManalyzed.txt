20251223 165236 Oh, sweet lady, would you marry me anyway? Would you have my baby? If I were a miller, and the mill should grind me, would you miss your lover less? Your soft shoe shadow, yes. Oh, sweet baby. If a ticker were my train, would you still find me? Absolutely, yes, I would. Come give me your tomorrow. If I were a carpenter and you were a lady. If you married me anyway, would you have my baby? Oh, baby.
