Leave me on red, babe, but I still get the message Instead of lines, three dots, but I can connect And if it ain't right, babe, you know I respect it But if you need time, just take your time Honey, I get it, I get, I get it Way you got me all in my head Think I'd rather you in my bed We are now at the end of our drive. Thank you for joining us on this drive. We hope you enjoyed the drive.
