20251222 151810 Perhaps this person is wondering whether it is a conflict. It can be a conflict if you are, so let us say you are representing a client and there is a particular document that can only be witnessed by a justice of the peace. If I were a justice of the piece, I, as an attorney acting for that client, I would not witness that document in my capacity as a justice of the peace. I would have my client find another justice of the peace and there's some documents like affidavits or statutory decorations that can only be witnessed by a justice of the piece. So again, yes, an attorney can be a justice of the piece, but, you know, of course we have to exercise due diligence and avoid conflicts of interest if we see any arising or even if we just, you know, see the perception of a conflict.
