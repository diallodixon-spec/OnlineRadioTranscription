20251225 111306 But you're sorry anyway True love can fade away Love, sometimes it reads the sky True love can never die True love is in you and I Your eyes on me I want you by my side Your eyes on eyes only I'll forever be your guide You will, yeah Forever be your guide Staying by your side Why? Cause love is hidden deep in me And I'll show you my sympathy Maybe spend some time with me Every night as the night moves in We're so hot, we're radioactive.
