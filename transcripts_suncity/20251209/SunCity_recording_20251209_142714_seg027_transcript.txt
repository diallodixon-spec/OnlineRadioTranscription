I'm stepping on the race to the top Who can hear me? Money can't do it, money refill We're not going to scrap up a hundred million Money top who I see a bit of standstill Can't know why I let this go through Them do what they want, we don't cater But sir, this side me not pay for We don't care if I know I'll later This is my name, everybody can swear for So I'm feeling like I'm gonna I don't want me slipping out of place, everybody. I'm slipping out of race to do the pop. Don't want me slipping down the stairs. Who can I am? I'm slipping, slipping, slipping. I'm feeling up. Watch me stand up. Watch me clench them. Hold these hands up, reach down, reach down. Pull up a roof. Twenty, twenty, Casper. Empty bar, empty bar with a top. How will them say? Pick a car, round plenty. Pick a car, that's what I choose. Out of the picture, when they not stop send me. Big Amalgi and watch it end shit. Wembley. Pryaya. Critics are representing us. Athens. Hatfinger. Life rich and lented. Stop a gap, my fortune.
