You don't want to hear the truth, the truth. Last night I was talking to a young man, a young lady, and they said, in Spanish, they said to me, I said to them, one of them said to me, boy, because they know me, boy, the Prime Minister is quarreling about, and saying we're in war and all that. And I said, the Prime Minister said Prime Ministership in our country, to a level where we never expect us to reach. And then they jumped up and said, the prime minister said prime ministership in her country, 12, 12 level where. And then they jumped up and said, but it's not different from Sister P. And I said, yeah, and that's my point. Sister P did what she did a couple years ago, probably about 20, 25 years now. And guess what? Are we to continue the same thing? Or we must raise the bar and replace our people, our different people. I'll just say. Oh, my brother. Actually, at the end of the year. Oh my brother, oh my brother. That's how the country has changed. All I ask for, all I ask for every day I come here is governance.
