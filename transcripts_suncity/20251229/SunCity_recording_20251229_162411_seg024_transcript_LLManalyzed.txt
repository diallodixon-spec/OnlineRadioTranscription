20251229 162411 We could change this machine of ours tonight. Knowing it's so wrong, feeling so wrong. It's such a good thing to wish you'd be. Just ask me why I don't even speak. I know the word is deep. We're part-time lovers. But if there's some emergency, have a male friend ask for me. Then she won't be for you, my part-time lover. We are undercover, bystanders on the run. Chasing love up against the sun. We just can't get by, daylovers, by night. Knowing it's so wrong, feeling's aggression. It's getting up all the time. Listen to your life, would you say?
