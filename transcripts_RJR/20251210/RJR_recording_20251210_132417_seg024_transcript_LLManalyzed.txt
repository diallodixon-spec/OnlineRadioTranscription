put them at risk of police pull them over and demand certain things from them it has to be done because none of this makes sense to me and you know I just wanted to raise it because people are becoming more and more creative especially at this time of year yes yeah so you know be very very careful people be vigilant yeah and if you see something say something absolutely if it sticks out to you then it then it is then it's not normal. Not normal. And don't just ride it out. No, no, no. If it's not normal, address it. And be your brother's keeper, because at the end of the day, when I'm driving off, him clear my gate already, you know. It's my neighbour's gate him stop. But I didn't like the fact that he stopped at my neighbour's gate. So that's why I turn around. Now for some people, they would have said, oh, under my house. Some are alright. But he stopped at the neighbour's gate because he thought I left. You know what I mean? So if I never care about my neighbour and turn back, no, you don't see how I'm going to get him there. You have to be vigilant. And you're right, they're getting so creative these days. I'm telling you.
