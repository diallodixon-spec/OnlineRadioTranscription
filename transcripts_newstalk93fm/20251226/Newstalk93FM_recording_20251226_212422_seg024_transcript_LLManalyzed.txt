20251226 212422 You don't like the fast life But look on the bright side, girl I go take the blame I just want you come and rise it up Just a little whine there now Come and meet me behind the truck and we rev it up The whole day Keep throwing it back at the way you stopped us Baby, no way We could boast of all the pictures you want, when you're ready. I could overshare, darling, you could overshare. What we could eat in the middle and start a bacchanal. Play in the middle, hey, what we gonna do now? Jam to a rhythm, heat a carnival. What we gonna do now, start a wine on it. I say compromise on it. Baby, spend time on it. I say compromise on it Baby, spend time on it, I said compromise on it
