No one, no one, no one is getting away from what I'm feeling back for more. I get what I'm asking for. No matter what you say about life, I learn every time I bleed. The truth is a stranger, so is the danger. I gotta let my spirit be free to admit that I'm wrong and then change my mind. Sorry, but I have to move on.
