If you think we should let go After all we've been through I should be the first to know Needless than security Oh, it's lonely killing me I've got to know, baby Tell me how you feel Are you still in love with me? Like the way you used to be? Or did it all fade away? And the hurt I feel isn't here to stay? Are you still loving me? Like you used to be Or did it all tumble down And the pain I feel Is it a state in my heart I won't accept What my mind knows too well
