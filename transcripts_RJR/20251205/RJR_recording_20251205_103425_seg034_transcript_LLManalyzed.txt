How are you and your listeners? I am fine, thank you. And I think my listeners are as well as can be under all of the circumstances. And you? Good. Thank you very much. I'm in there. I'm here with the chief medical officer, Dr. MacKenzie. Yes. And we have been up and down and about all over trying to focus on the five parishes that were affected by Melissa and slowly working it through. So today we wanted to just comment on two things briefly. First one, another hospital that has come on board temporarily. The last three were field hospitals that were stationed at different locations in Westmoreland, St. Elizabeth and Trelawny. But yesterday we had a tour of the floating 300-bed Chinese hospital that is now in Montego Bay to go to Trelawny.
