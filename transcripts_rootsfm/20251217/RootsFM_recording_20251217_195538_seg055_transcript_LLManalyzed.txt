20251217 195538 Enjoy yourself, go on and move. Let the madness and the music get to you. Life is so bad at home. Live it off the wall. Live your life off the wall. Do what you want to do. There ain't no rules, it's up to you No rules, it's time to give it life And party all right through the night All right You're in the visions Gotta let that fool lose deep inside your soul Wanna see an exhibition Better do it now before you get too old Cause we're the party people night and day Living crazy, that's the only reason tonight
