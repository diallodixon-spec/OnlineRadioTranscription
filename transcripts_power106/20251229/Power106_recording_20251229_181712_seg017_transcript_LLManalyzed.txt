20251229 181712 parents, where my husband and I are both from, you know, background where we love sports, him from Karate coming out of the YMCA in Kingston, Jamaica. And I did track and field at Maura Bay High School, even broke a long jump record at Girls' Jams. And so my family has a good history of being in sports. And was really good to see them flourish in swimming. It took a lot of hard work, most of all from them to be dedicated. But in the background, as parents, we had to guide them and we got a lot of support across the Caribbean and around the world. People ask what it means to be an elite parent. There is nothing much in it for me more than just the joy of seeing that my children have accomplished something.
