We turn the winter into paradise. It's a reggae Christmas. Come and sing along. Feel the love and joy in every song. From Kingston down to the Northern Lights. It's a Reggae Christmas. Everybody unite unite Children dancing in the frosty air Santa's skanking like he just don't care Rasta reindeer on the island breeze
