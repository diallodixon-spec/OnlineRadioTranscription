20251226 154542 I know it is a must, for us to make it home the ganache in the teeth of a meat These are those who constantly they have been placing The raps on the traps, leaving devil's snares laying And them who's real, who they hate to be pardoned Getting on them face, the way on them face The way on them face Feeling I'm remaking it as to my way To go out on my knees Never let them worry you at all You can only be yourself, my friend
