20251216 152211 It feels good to love somebody and somebody loves you back But it feels one sided now It feels hit it now You don't have to return about it Cause it's crystal glad now, now Guess it's bye to the good times I'll be gone by the sunrise I'll be better on my own I'll be better, on my own, now, now Nobody should call my phone Nobody should call, my phone, now, now this is my last heartbreak song This is my last heartbreaking song Nah, nah, I'll be good on my own I'll be good all on my own Nah, nah Why are you so quick to leave When we both can make it work
