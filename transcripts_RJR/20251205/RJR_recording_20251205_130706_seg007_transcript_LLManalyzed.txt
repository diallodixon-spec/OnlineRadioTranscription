Eyes that you can't ignore And passion burns you like never before I wasn't certain of a good child Just running my game, yeah Love was the furthest, furthest from my mind, yeah No more love on the run. I love you, I need you. Call it real quick. We're sharing the same dream. The ones that got hearts better be that one. No more love.
