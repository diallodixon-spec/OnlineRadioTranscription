2025-12-12 11:29:09 I don't know. I mean, I'm assuming the Health Minister knows, but it could just be a braggadocious statement on his behalf. But I don't see how that's possible. Remember the statement about leptospirosis? Yes. The Minister's original statement. Where are we now? Right. Well, they're now talking about over 100 cases. 11 just reported in St. Casper with two deaths. So we can't take nothing that he says seriously? I'm not so sure. You know sometimes when you read the reports you don't get the full sum of what maybe somebody said but this on the face of it that we're alright and we thank them for the service and they're gone and we'll be okay. I'm sorry. It sounds like a little bit of bravado. Yeah man, they also said that there would be no outbreak of leptospirosis and where are we now? So, I don't take anything that this minister says seriously. It's all PR braggadocio.
