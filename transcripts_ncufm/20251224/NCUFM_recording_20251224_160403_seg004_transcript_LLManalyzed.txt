20251224 160403 You have the look of a drummer for sure. That's a really good thing. So what inspired you to use music as a primary tool for spreading the word of God? Well, you see, you have to be multifaceted, you know. A lot of persons don't tune in to hear the spoken word, so a person will not come to church to hear the preaching of the word. So where that cannot reach, I use music as an art to reach to, you know, the un-church or the un-reach. Many persons here in the taxi, like, you know, many persons going home are in traffic now listening to drive-by. You hear a song and he'll minister unto them. So that's my form of evangelizing through music. Okay, that's actually genuinely good. That's really, really good. So then how do you ensure that your music ministers the souls and not just entertain the listeners?
