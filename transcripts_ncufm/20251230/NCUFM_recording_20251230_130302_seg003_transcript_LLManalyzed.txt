20251230 130302 I'm begging you, Lord. Please have mercy. Sometimes it's wrong. But I know you're working on me. On things some people can't see. But you said you love me and you'll never leave. You've given me the key so now I am set free Oh Oh, where, where else can I go But you, oh Lord, I love you
