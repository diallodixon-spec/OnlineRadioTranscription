20251212 172318 You don't have to return about it cause it's crystal glad now now. Guess it's bye to the good times. I'll be gone by the sunrise. I'll be better on my own. Nobody should call my phone, nobody should call my phone. This is my last heartbreak song. When we both can make you when I'm'm gone, I'll make you nervous If you hurt me, I deserve it I've been acting foolishly Forgetting what you are You start loving me, I know this But even chaos serves a purpose
