20251231 165127 baby go and leave me all the way don't ask for all your things back cussing out my name yeah just to go and take back what you say burn all the bridges don't ask for forgiveness walk away like i'm someone you hate don't act like my love wasn't nothin' Like I wasn't the one you was holdin' that night Tellin' all of your secrets to hug you Guess you're right, it's too good to be true What's important, all I needed was you But time after time, I just fussin' and fightin' It's time that you do what you do And it's cool, mama said it was fishin' to see I got lost in the pool Knew it was comin', I watched how you moved How you turned up back on me and laid me to lose Remember the text, how you said that you'd do? Said that you'd never leave, we would fight till it's due But as it went on, I was fighting for you Said the text turned green, why the fuck it ain't blue? Yeah, she done and I get it Said you stand, you wanted my name and you left So I'm guessing that you never meant it Said you trying hard, oh, cause the loot was so strong Now I'm standing alone in this kitchen
