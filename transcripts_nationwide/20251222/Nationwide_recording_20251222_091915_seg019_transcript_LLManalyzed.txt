20251222 091915 not any new updates really, but I mean, things to note for the new year is that if you are in Canada as a student or a worker, I strongly recommend that you probably start putting together your documents for permanent residency because we are hoping that there will be some new categories or new pathways for persons in Canada to apply for permanent residency. Of course, you will need to have your English test done. You will need to have you education assessed. If you completed your tertiary level education outside of Canada as well, you want to include as much supporting documents to increase your chances of being selected from whatever category will be implemented. In addition, you would also need to get your job letters and job descriptions for pretty much, normally they ask for all of the positions that you've ever held in NORA.
