============================================================

We're getting the hang of feeding the partridge now, although it was difficult at first to win its confidence. It bit the mother rather badly in the hand, but they're good friends now, and we're keeping the pair three indoors in a bucket. Thank you again, yours affectionately, Governor O'Lownessie. Day two. Dear Nula, I cannot tell you how surprised we were to hear from you so soon again, and to receive your lovely present of two turtle dogs. You really are too kind. At first the partridge was very jealous and suspicious of the dogs and they had a terrible row on the night the dogs arrived. We had to send for the vet. But the birds are okay again and the stitches is due to come out.
