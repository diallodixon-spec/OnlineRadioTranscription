20251215 141310 I'm striving straight up to the top Not giving up obstacle block Got to find a way out You've got your problems I've got my mountain to climb We all got things on our mind. I am sure everything will be fine. Cause I know how hard I'm trying. Do you know now? Cause I know how I'm trying. Believe me, I can't. I don't know how. I just see y'all.
