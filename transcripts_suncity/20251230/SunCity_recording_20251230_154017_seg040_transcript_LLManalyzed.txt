20251230 154017 Big up yourself, Stacy. Thanks for keeping it locked. Sexy Cher, big up yourself. You understand? Yeah, man, she says happy birthday to Sir Billings. All right, now hear yourself, Sexy Cher. I'll play that song for him on behalf of you, for real, for real. Yeah, man. All right, son Milly, got it locked in. Over there in Kitsitown, big up the Kitsitown crew. Locked in, dollar bill the boss, from March Bend Road, Spanish tune. You have no clown? You must be mad, no clown can come from March Bend Road. You mad? Serf, shout outs to you, all right? And she says, hi Ali, first time I'm sending shout out to you and all the Sun City listeners. I'm looking at past conversations.
