I will never understand how people always hurt their loved ones for their selfish needs. Being honest, but he could have been honest after or before, but not the morning in the holidays. Yes, Joe, that's what bothers me the most. Out of any other day to confess your infidelity, you chose Christmas morning. Man, Joe, let me keep my mouth quiet. We're moving on to the next question. So it says, Dear son Diamond, I'm the black sheep of my family. Not because I'm doing badly, but because I'm doing well. I've built my business from nothing and instead of support, my own siblings tear me down. They gossip about me to strangers, badmouth me, badmouth my work and twist my success into arrogance. Any rule
