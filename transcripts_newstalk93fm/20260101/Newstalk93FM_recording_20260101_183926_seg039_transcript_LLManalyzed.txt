20260101 183926 My love is worth it, press it up, y'all. Push the stars. I like you, hurt me. On this, I've made up with you to serve for me. Shake it up like an earthquake. Press it up. Y'all push the stars. On the bang, bang, bang. Pushin' on my buttons with no hesitation. Gas me up, give's go. I am the king for your world So the bubble when you bring it to space, my rising It is tantalizing, come make me feel it
