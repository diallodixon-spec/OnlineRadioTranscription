20260102 090104 I have a lightning spirit Early in the morning I hat it Me cooler ready, me ice done ready Me punching that's automatic I have a lightning jumbie A kind of energy inside me And it ready for the rum Ready ready for the rum, ready ready go. It's action time, let we go, it's bacchanal time, here we go! Hands up! This vetting spirit havin' me feelin' good!
