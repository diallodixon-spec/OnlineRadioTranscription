2025-12-12 14:34:36 I could hold the whole world here in my hands, in my hands. It's Lovers Thursday. Until I leave 104.9 FF. Powerless to leave you, baby. Cause your touch is just too sweet And I am in this love so deep I have to be superhuman Superhuman Made out of steel Cause I feel what I'm feeling, to love and love you baby, love you baby. I'd have to have the strength of ten men, to ever resist a love as long as it's still like this.
