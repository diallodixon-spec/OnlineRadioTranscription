Good evening and welcome to Sportsworld. I'm Denise Walters. We start things with some cricketing news. The West Indies were 56 for 2 in their first innings reply at sports time in the morning session and day two of the opening test against host New Zealand at Christchurch. They trailed by 175 runs. Shehoop 30 and Tejnara and Sean Paul 16 are the batters at the Greece. Earlier the Kiw who resumed on 231 for 9, failed to add to their overnight tally. There were two wickets each for Kemar Roach, Jaden Seals, Justin Greaves and Debutan First Bowl of Jamaica's Jay Seals.
