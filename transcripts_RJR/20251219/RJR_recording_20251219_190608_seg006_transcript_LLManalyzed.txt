20251219 190608 I got back to my interview with Dr. Fenton Ferguson. Couple of your comments. Comment in Gregory Park says, just listening again to this re-broadcast brings a smile. Listening to Dr.Fenton Ferguson, who is also a member of St. Mary the Virgin's Church. His mom was also a founding member and helped in building the church. And one of our listeners says, you've honored some priceless materials with your yard isroad and Feel Good Friday interviews. The impact is even more profound when listening again on the app. We can pause between tears and not miss a moment. Great pieces of work are timeless and will always remain relevant. Thank you so much for the feedback. Really do appreciate it. All right, so we are going now to go back to my interview with Dr. Fenton Ferguson explaining the circumstances under which he came to adopt his son, who then adopted a young man in turn and the cycle apparently is continuing. Let's go back to Dr.Fenton Ferguson.
