20251225 105644 There's a birthday party at the home of Grey. It'll be the perfect ending of war. It's the day when we sing the songs we love to sing. Without a single star. At the fire place while we watch the chestnuts pop. There's a happy feeling, nothing in the world can buy. When they pass around the coffee and the ball and by It'll really be like I'm with your friend, the curator and us These wonderful things are the things we remember all through our lives Just hear the sleigh bells ticking and we're tickling, too
