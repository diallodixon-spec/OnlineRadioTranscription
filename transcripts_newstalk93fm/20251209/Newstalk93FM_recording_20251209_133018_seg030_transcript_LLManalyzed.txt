It's Cardi, it's Cardi, Kehlani, Kehlani It's you and I, baby, I, I, baby. Yeah, look, I don't need a rich to somebody that can make me feel safe, yeah. Look, I don't want a couple, but nobody ever made me feel safe like you. Because when I'm with you, I just know I'm fine. Know I'm fine. You take all the pressure off my mind. All the time. Patient and kind will not be going out my mind. Say from the problems, I don't worry, because I'm hard to find. I'm from the block, baby. It's doing up, baby. The world turn against me. Who I got, baby? I set you up, baby. I've been a flop.
