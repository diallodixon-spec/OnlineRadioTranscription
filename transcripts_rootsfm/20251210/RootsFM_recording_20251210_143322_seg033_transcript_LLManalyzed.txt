I was smiling about my business, just doing about my day. Never dreamt in a million years, girl, true love would have come my way. Then you came and took such a good shot. Girl, you really pitched my heart. Because once you were in my arms, baby, you stole my heart. Bullseye, you hit me right between the eyes with your sweet love. What a shot I never got enough I wasn't expecting this Never met no one quite like me
