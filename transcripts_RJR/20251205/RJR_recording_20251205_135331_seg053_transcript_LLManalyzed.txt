Pam Thomas over there in Westchester, enough love from Tony Thomas in London. Alright, this one is going out to my grand-niece, Amaree Jackson of Two East Greater Portmore. She's 18 today, hey? A big birthday, you see that Amaree? How you do? Wishing you an amazing day and just always, always, always, God's blessings to you and it's coming from Dalia in East Kingston. I'd like to send birthday greetings to my loving daughter Brittany Brown of Destin, Florida. Brittany's celebrating her 20th birthday today and is coming from her mom, Angela, dad, Robert, sisters, Judy Ann, Renee, and Afia, and her brother, Orlando. Birthday greetings greetings to twin sisters Merle and Marlene Rose. They're from Fort District in Manchineel and that one is coming from Celine.
