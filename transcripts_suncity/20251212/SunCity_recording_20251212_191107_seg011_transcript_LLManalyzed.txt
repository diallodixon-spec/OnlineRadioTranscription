20251212 191107 I can't build no businesses, they want a partner I'm not just a dreamer, I can't feel me drawn, not a schemer Baby I'm in love with your potential But potential can't pay the rent now La la ooh, la la ooh, sing it You could be great but you move too slow Baby I'm in lo-o-ove with your potential But me can't carry this weight alone La la ooh, La la ooh, yeah Step up now, me done, me done How many times me officer the same thing? Feels like me dead but me dead We take you to business for life! It's still not four days.
