By this time now, so happy to go to the States that, you know, I'm just going with the clothes on my back and just one small bag. It's me and two of my brother's younger siblings. And I just went, you know, the books, the books, they were there beside the bag, you know, but I just, when the taxi come to get me, I just grabbed the bag up and just went, he gone up on the plane. So by the time he reached New York, I said, I booked them. By the time he called forward a neighbor, he said, you know, Precious, tear up the book. There were some little children over there. He said, you know Precious, go over there and see them in pieces. Precious just, I said, what? I start writing again. You know, start writing again and, you know, living in New York, you know, doing the thing, going around, doing what we're doing, you know, start writing again and, you know, maybe in New York, you know, we're doing the thing, going around, doing what we're doing, you know, working, trying to make life better, but then got seduced by the streets. So we got seduced by these streets and the streets took us to Incazua.
