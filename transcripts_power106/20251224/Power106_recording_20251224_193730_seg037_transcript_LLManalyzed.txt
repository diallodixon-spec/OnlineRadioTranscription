20251224 193730 Then we have a couple of fellows here, number 8, Shee Dallas Love, to be read by Tyrese Anderson from the Rowan Quieton Camp. Has been doing a lot of plotting and exercise and will report very fit. And then there's Dane Nelson about pineapple. And Dane Nelson showing his superiority, no question about that. And the amounts he has been receiving over the last three weeks since he has been back here. So Miss Sherry though is my selection and I'm making it a firm one to get the bet of number seven. Pineapple at number eight, she got us a lot. All right, fourth event is a maiden condition race for three world fillies and we have a field of 9 declared. Now horse number 3, last possession, ran for the second time on the 14th of December. That was not a bad effort at all. 5 wins, 4 to darks 1.
