20251226 143527 Freestyle Boxing Day vibe and we say hello to Ayana Dixon. Hey Ayana, how you doing? Thanks. Merry Christmas. Yes. Yes. You know, Boxing Day is about slowing down after the wash, but I don't think it's slowing down for creatives. I think this time of year, creatives just keep going and going. Going and going. Yeah. How does rest or quiet time impact your creativity? Well, it's quite important for any creative person to have some downtime. I really believe that you have to take time to be inspired and you can only do that when you're still, you know. So whether it's for me, it's going to the beach, for somebody else it might be be reading it might be just relaxing and just quote unquote being lazy as your parents would say it's not being lazy but some of your best ideas will come from that downtime where you're exploring other avenues trying other things that aren't necessarily in direct line to your field yeah
