20251218 125128 I missed this greeting sent long before Captain's Log. the journey extra special as we celebrate each other with lots of fun and excitement. May he bless our union as we pour out our love on each other. Happy anniversary to the Coombs. He did not despair He started over again And I blessed the day He didn't throw the clay away
