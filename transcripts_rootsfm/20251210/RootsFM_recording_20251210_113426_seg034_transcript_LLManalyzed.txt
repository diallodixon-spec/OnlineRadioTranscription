What happened why this little girl was given to this stranger? And it could have been terrible. And when me and him father go for him and me say, oh, you'll find Kyle, because at St. Louis, it's all like a little boy of them fat and look same way. So Kyle's father always say, me not find Kyle, me stand up till Kyle find me. Because me can't find Kyle with all of those kids in the space. So he knew that you would stand there until Kyle come find you. Right, right, right. But please, I don't want to hear, we have had over the past month and a half, enough tragedies and disaster occasions we don't want to have.
