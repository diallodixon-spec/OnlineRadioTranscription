20251230 094527 On December 13, 1924, a quiet announcement shook the world. Astronomer Edwin Hubble revealed that the faint smudges of light in the night sky were not stars at all, but entire galaxies beyond the Milky Way. Until then, humanity believed our galaxy was the whole universe. But Hubble's discovery expanded our vision. It showed us that creation was far bigger, more mysterious, and more beautiful than we had ever imagined. Now Hubble's journey wasn't easy. Many scientists doubted him. The instruments of his time were limited and the idea of other galaxies seemed impossible.
