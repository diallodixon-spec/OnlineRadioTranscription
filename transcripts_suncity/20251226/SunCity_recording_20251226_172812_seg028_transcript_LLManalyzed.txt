20251226 172812 and then try to turn it into a four furlong sprint when they hit the far turn. And I think having just come out of a stretch where Fidelity ran 46 and changed for the first four and then finished up in a very good six and one fifth for the last half a furlong, it means stretching out. If he sees 48 and change after having just run 46 It will be a cakewalk for him. So number 12 currently getting odds of 9 to 1 Thank You Brian is Gonna be my pick to definitely hit the board, but it's a wide open event. It's kind of a guessing game So whoever you like put him in in there fidelity in there with the one you like for second and third or in the you know box three or four of them for the um quinella or exactly whatever you prefer but i don't think this favorite here one hole if he wins out of the one hole i'd be sure
