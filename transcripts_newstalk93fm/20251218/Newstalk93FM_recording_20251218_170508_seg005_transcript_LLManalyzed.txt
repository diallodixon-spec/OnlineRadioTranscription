20251218 170508 I'm not coming home tonight Don't sign the party Girl don't send no search party to find me I'm not coming out tonight I'm not coming up tonight I'm drunk in the party So I don't think no search party can find me I was a member of the melodies Now the liquor take all of me And the bass knock my soul out I'm in Chesoka, won't let me leave I don't know if I'll survive Song after song, wine after wine I go sing strong and fit for life Weak like the road, I'm ready to walk, just up work, time to free up. Gonna bow and let me go. Go send a search party to Friday. I out on the road all night. Tell them that this hookah hang me. Hey, hey, you'll see me Wednesday.
