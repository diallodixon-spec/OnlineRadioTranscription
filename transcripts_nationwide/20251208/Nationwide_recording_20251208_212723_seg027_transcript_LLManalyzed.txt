Since I met you I've begun to feel so strange Every time I speak your name That's funny You say that you are so helpless too But you don't know what to do Each night I pray there will never come a day When you up and take your love away Say you feel the same way too And I wonder what it is I feel for you Could it be I'm falling in love with you baby? Could it be I've fallen in love, could it be I'm Falling in love with you, with you?
