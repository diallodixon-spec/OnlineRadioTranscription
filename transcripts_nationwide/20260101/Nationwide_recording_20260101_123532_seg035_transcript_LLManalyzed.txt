20260101 123532 are and look forward with determination to where we must go. This New Year calls for a renewed ethos, one of resilience, responsibility, cooperation, and shared sacrifice. Recovery will not be easy, but it is possible. It is possible if we dig deep within ourselves and give our very best in all situations. We are blessed as a nation with faith in Almighty God, blessed with belief in one another, blessed with the support of our families, our friends, our diaspora, and our regional and international partners. But above all, our greatest strength lies within us, our willingness to work together, to stay the course, and to build back better for generations to come. Our motto is, out of many one people, let us live these words, not only in speech, but in action. And as one people, let's recover.
