20251230 181408 I just want you to come and bite it up Just a little winding up Come and meet me behind the truck and we rev it up Whole day, keep throwing it back I know why you stop Baby, no way We could post up all the pictures you want when you're ready.

And it's nothing too risky. Limited liability.
