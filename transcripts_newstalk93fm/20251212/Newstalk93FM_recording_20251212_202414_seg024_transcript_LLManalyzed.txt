20251212 202414 before I decide to go home. Act like you heard me. Only serve it up if you deserve me. Girl, my love is worth it. Press it up, y'all. Push the stars. Act like you've heard me. Only set it up if you deserved me. Shake it up like an earthquake. Press it up y'all, push the stars. When I bang, bang, bang. Pushin' on my buttons when I hesitate. Gas me up, give me motivation. We can't be honest to be honest, but this I'm gonna make you fly just like bird. I make you wiggle with the thing, I make you jiggle with the thing. Move up your body and I swing, I am the king for your world.
