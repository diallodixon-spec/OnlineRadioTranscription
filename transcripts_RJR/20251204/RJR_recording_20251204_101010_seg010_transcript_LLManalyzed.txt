I took it to heart. I said I would never live under another Andrew in this government. What you said to me? You went to St. Vincent and Dr. Ralph Luce? Poor? No. Why are you not going to live under another Andrew? So where are you now? You're still out of Jamaica then? I am still out of Jamaica, but I am back here. I've been here for a couple of weeks now. You know, been helping with the hurricane recovery, especially in the West. So, you know, it's just sad. It's really sad to see what has happened to the entire, my favorite place of the world, Westmoreland and St. James. Where in Westmoreland do you go? So we do, particularly up in western Westmoreland, which is not devastated a lot, but you have places that nobody really go. As in where? Up in this place called Brighton and over in Amity, which is eastern.
