20251218 180402 I'm not gonna take that anymore Hungry minds who stare you in the eye Spread it thick and lay the biggest lies Don't say what you're feeling Must be hard to get All those time I'm sticking in your head So much pressure to keep holding on Pack my clothes up, baby, I'll be gone I've got to stand up, got to break it up now And I think about tomorrow Ooh, I can't wait to start it up Got to start it up now If I have to go tomorrow I'm not gonna take it anymore
