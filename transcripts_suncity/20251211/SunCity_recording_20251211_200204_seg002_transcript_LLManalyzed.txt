2025-12-12 13:44:32 Mr. Olivia Grange made the disclosure during last Wednesday's post-cabinet press briefing at Jamaica House, where she read a letter from the grandson of His Imperial Majesty, Emperor Al-Selassie. And it's addressed to the Prime Minister and he writes, I write to express to you my deepest condolences for the tragedy brought to Jamaica by Hurricane Melissa. The loss of life and the damage to Jamaica's infrastructure brings sadness and raises challenges. I know that while you mourn what has been lost, you will lead Jamaica into a better future through the process of rebuilding. In light of the long-standing bonds of friendship between Jamaica and Ethiopia, I want to do everything in my power to help you in that process.
