20251229 133433 I feel good Tried to keep my hands on the table It's been hard just for the last You know you ought to slow down You've been working too hard and that's a fact Sit back and relax awhile Take some time to laugh and smile Lay your hands in the old ground So we can stop and give back It seems we'd never take the time to do All the things we want to, yeah
