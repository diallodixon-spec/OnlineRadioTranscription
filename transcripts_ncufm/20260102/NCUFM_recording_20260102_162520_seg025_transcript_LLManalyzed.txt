20260102 162520 I'm like a front tire on the bus. The bus can't move without the front tire now. Brother Gary. Shabbat shalom. Happy Shabbat to you too, Sister Maxine. I hear you, I hear you. Take care now. See you on online chat tomorrow, okay? Take care now, Sister Maxine. God bless. And get home safely from work. Are you staying at home? That is good and the staff of NCUFM. Have a prosperous one. Enough love and blessings. Blessings every time. Craig will sing. Happy new year to you and the drive time family. Big up on yourself. Blessings my bro.
