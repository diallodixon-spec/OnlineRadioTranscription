I know I ain't first up full of a bad mind. Then I won't make you have to see your bread a jumbo. And have some good rice, true rice. First before you pass, I ain't get go and have some good rice, true rice. Pray before your pa Zion Gekko, and have some good rice. It give you long days. Oh, now them tears out, they make you sanitize. Good rice, long rice. Nah, like a king cellar, see tuna screw face. Good rice, it give you good rice.
