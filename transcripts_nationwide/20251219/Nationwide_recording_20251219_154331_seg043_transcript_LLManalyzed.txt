20251219 154331 We don't love anymore What was all of it for? We don't talk anymore Like we used to do I just heard you found the one you've been looking You've been looking for I wish I would've known that wasn't me Cause even after all this time we're still one Why can't can't move on Just the way you did so brutally Don't wanna know How to dress you up tonight Please hold on until you're so tight Pray I didn't before I won't go Should've known your love was a game Now I can't get you out of my brain Oh, it's such a shame We don't talk anymore We don't talk any more We don't talk in our mind I don't wanna be alone tonight
