20251223 095539 This is my decision I Don't think you listen your lesson. I don't think you listen For me to come out I want to show you my world. Give me one break. I need faith. Faith to believe you. Faith to receive you. Give me something I'm lacking. I don't need nothing. You are my everything Only me and you, only me and you
