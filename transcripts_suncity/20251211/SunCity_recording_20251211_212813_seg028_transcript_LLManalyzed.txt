2025-12-12 15:13:04 It feels like something's moving inside of me. My heart is doing backflips in spite of me. And there's no place that I would want to be. And with change in my mind, so y'all just pray for me Right next to Peter's head, cause nobody wants to grow old. Those fellas, baby, they never, never learn. They never understand what it's like to be in love. Never, never learn.
