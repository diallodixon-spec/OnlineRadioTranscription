It's Mary Jane, I'm analyzing the game And the game's done choked me To bring me pretty women and fake thugs wanting to save Ever since you told me It's only room for two, I've been making less room for you Now only God can hold me Hug me, love me, judge me The only man that hugs is the Buffy Hopper I've met so many men and it's like they're all the same My appetite for loving is now my hunger thing And when I'm feeling sexy, who's gonna comfort me?
