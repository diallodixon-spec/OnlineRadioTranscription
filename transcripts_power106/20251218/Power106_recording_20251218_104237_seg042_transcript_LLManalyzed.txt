That's a good reason to have these Christmas villages when you think about what our farming community, fishing community or mining community, what these communities have been through. Of course, the relief and just that human touch to say, listen, we are with you. We're here to support you. We will not forsake you. Not just to give you fertilizer. Absolutely. But also to reach out to your family as well. Right. To bring a little Christmas spirit where we feel like a lot of persons have been abandoning that, but we want to bring that back to the communities as it were.
