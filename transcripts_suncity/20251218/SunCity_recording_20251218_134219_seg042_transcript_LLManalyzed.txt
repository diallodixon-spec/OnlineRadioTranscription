20251218 134219 I can't go on without you Cause I don't need no independence Love has come and I just can't end it now Now that I've made it with you I know that You were the key You got out the best in me You helped helped me to be stronger. You kept me moving longer, baby. You were the light. You brightened up my darkest nights. Now you say I'm stronger.
