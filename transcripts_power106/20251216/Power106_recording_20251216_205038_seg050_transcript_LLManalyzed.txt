20251216 205038 Honey, I know you've asked me a million times, well If I'd ever thought of leaving you for someone else I guess you just don't see you mean the world to me And I never want to hurt you, my dear Funny when I hear you say that I don't need you Cause I'm half a man and woman Without you here by my side And I'm proud of you honestly So darling don't be afraid Cause how do we know from day to day
