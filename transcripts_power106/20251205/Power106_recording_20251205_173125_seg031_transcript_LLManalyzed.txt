It would be amazing. It would absolutely be amazing. So let's see how it fares out. But this is going to be fantastic, Matthew. And I'm really looking forward to having you come back for us to deliberate on who comes out on top. Yes. Should there be any stir in the pot and some unexpected activity happen? Yes. Yes, for sure. And I'm looking forward to the Grand Prix. I am going to wake up very early and make sure that I have all my breakfast and everything ready, you know, because this is going to be a spicy and intense one, for sure. Definitely, definitely. Matthew, thank you very much. It's always a pleasure to have you. Yes, wake up yourselves and come next week, please, and come and tell us what the results look like. I'll tell you all the antics will go on because I know that when you're watching these things it's a big party so I want to hear all of what is going on in the background as well. Alright, I'll record some of it. Alright then, thank you very much Matthew, have a great weekend. Yeah man, same to you Chellian.
