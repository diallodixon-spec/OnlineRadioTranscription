20251216 114118 This is, this is, this is unreal. I can't, I can't pull the curtain. I can't. I can't see too much sun coming in my face. I can't pull it. The curtain. But this curtain, I can't tap no sun from coming in. I can't lock the window. I can't take this. Oh, the sunlight is blinding me. Okay, I can't lock it. Okay, I'm trying to lock all the sun. The sun's still a-pumped through the crease in my house. Where is my shades? Where is my shades, yes? I can't put on my shades. They're deep dark, yes. Okay, I cannot take this. The sun is killing me. Have mercy. Not even my shoes are helping me. What is going on? I'm going to sleep. Maybe if I go to sleep, I'll get the sun out. Maybe night time, maybe the sun will go away from me. Yes, man. What is this? Night time and the sun is still blinding me. The sun is everywhere. It's the radio. The radio is on. Sun City is on the radio. That is why it's pure sun. Lord, we have sunned them out. Sun City. Sun City.
