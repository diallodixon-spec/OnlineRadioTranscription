20251230 210406 Come over if you really want I spy, I spy That you see something you might like Won't you come over if you really feel it? Ask all your questions, yes I really need it Eyes wide, eyes wide That you see something in my life Won't come over if you feel it Ask all your questions Yes I really need it And I know just what you need And when the love of your heart starts revealing I for sure won't let that go And say can we never really plan to look you But do you want me to see you move you? Can you hook to me? Can you go tell him to let me cook you? After that he won't let you go
