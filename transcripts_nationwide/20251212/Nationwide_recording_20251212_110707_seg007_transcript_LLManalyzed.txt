2025-12-12 11:26:34 Blessed Father, we kneel at your feet And the warmth of your presence is sweet Lord, reach down from your throne Make Jamaica your own For a work of your hand is complete Give your people the power In this land at this hour To accomplish your work in our hearts Give us wisdom to show where our nation must go. Touch me, Father, and make me the star. Precious Savior,
