20251225 115448 It's the half-happiest season of all. With those holiday greetings and day-happy meetings when friends come to call, it's the half-happyest season of all. There'll be parties for toasting marshmallows, toasting and carrying out your soul. There'll be stereo stories and tales of the girlies of Christmases long, long ago. It's the most wonderful time of the year.
