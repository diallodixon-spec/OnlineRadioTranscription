Listen, I saw the list from the early childhood commission of the early childhood institutions that have been affected, but what stood out more for me were the number of children who are going to be affected. Because when you look at the numbers and see how many students go to the schools, it's a lot. So kudos to Barita Foundation for stepping in and remembering the children. Oh yes, we have no choice. They're the future and our tagline is that tomorrow is built on today's foundation. So, if the foundation is not solid, then what's going to happen tomorrow when you and I would need them to be strong to hold us up. Of course, when they need them going, I'm telling you. Alright, thank you. So, for the folks who are listening who are not yet here, what is your final words to them? They must come down. First of all, the festival property is so fantastic. It's so fabulous. They need to come and see it. Come and buy your gas, but definitely come and make your donations. We're collecting non-perishables. We're collecting things for children at the early childhood stage.
