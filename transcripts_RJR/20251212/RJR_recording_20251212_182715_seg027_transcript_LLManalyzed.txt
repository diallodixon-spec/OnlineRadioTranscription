20251212 182715 we don't do all that antics slapping up each other. And like I saw the competitors even bucking to each other with their helmets, like that give you a concussion before you even enter the race. So, I mean, as Jamaicans, we're very calm and collective. I mean, we don't really make the pressure get to us because we know our quality. We know what we're capable of doing. So as a team, we just, some of the time we have like team meetings before race day and we stick to one plan. We move as a group. The minute we get to the track on race day or training day, we move as a group in one unit and we just get the job done. I mean, once the pilot talks and tells us what he wants from us and what the coaches want from us, we just try to execute it to the best of our abilities. Which one of you is the comic relief among the bunch?
