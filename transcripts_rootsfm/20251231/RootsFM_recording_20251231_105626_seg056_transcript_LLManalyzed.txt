20251231 105626 God bless the heart that lives unto his brother, praising out your name. He said be not afraid, so believe I will save you. And if you're thirsty, I will quench you with my love. And if you hunger, I will feed you with my word. And all I ask of you is that you love as I do. And if you lose your way, I'll lead you to my love. From a sinful life, I'll net you in my love. For creation is a weakness of my love, for creation there's a weakness of my love. I know that you should know it's time for the world to try and try love. The open love that can release it. Try and try love. So won't you try it?
