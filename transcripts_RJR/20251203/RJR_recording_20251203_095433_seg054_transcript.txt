that there are a lot of things that can happen to you in the recovery period because you know we get excited about stuff and all of that but you know as you are going to put back up say some of the building material you lost a piece of cellar text and you found it you're putting it back up it looks okay but then you don't realize that it actually has mold underneath it.

From the hurricane itself, yeah. But go ahead, please.
