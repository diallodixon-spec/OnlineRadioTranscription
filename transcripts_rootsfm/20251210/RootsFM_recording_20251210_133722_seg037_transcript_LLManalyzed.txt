============================================================

I have faith in love, faith in us And faith that this is right I surrender forever tonight Oh, my heart's racing, I'm shaking Caught up in the love we're making This is no, this is no ordinary love, oh baby. Happy, happy, happy days are here again. Love is in the air again, love is in the air. Happy days again, And it's amazing. My foe is now my friend. This world is changing. Brudge we used to hold. And vibes we will show. We're no longer insecure.
