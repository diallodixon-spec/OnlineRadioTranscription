20251226 181009 Clouds are great But I'm gonna have a happy day I've been here all day On a rainy Saturday All I need is you Right here, right now Say my name In the rain You are my treasure, your pleasure is my pleasure Let it rain to your lesser, now we know you love the weather We know what you prefer, plus we're ready for whatever In the rain, just the two of us together, sing it again All I need is you Right here, say my name Give the rain, rain, then come I trust you want the light and rain Close your eyes and let it rain Straight to the present, baby
