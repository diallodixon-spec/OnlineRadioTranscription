Good afternoon, welcome to your lunchtime sports reporter, I'm Oreen Bokanon. Host New Zealand closed the opening day of the second test on 24 without loss against the West Indies on Wednesday at on a decent opening stand of 66 between openers John Campbell who made 44 and Brandon King who made 33 as the team was dismissed for 2-0-5. She hoped to obscure with 44 and Captain Ruston Chase made 29 against Bear Thickness 4 for 32 and Michael Ray who grabbed 3 for 67. The first test in the series ended in a drawing Christchurch last week. Hope admits they should have put more runs on the board.
