20251229 142321 I love you, there's nothing I'd put on for you No host, no girl, no cure Stand firm in all my life, nothing I'd bust you From my barn, me and you apart Movie on my princess, movie on my dan First lady in my life, a girl and we understand Special dedication to this woman From your love, your momma made me see your eyes Hey! This is the drum! Hey! Where would I be, Lord Where would I be Where would I be without my mama
