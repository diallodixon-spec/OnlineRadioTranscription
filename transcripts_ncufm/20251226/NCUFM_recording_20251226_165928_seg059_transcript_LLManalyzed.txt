20251226 165928 Hopefully we can hear from Sunset Serenade, but if not, fret not, we still have some nice music to take you through the evening. But until we see each other again, Monday morning, not Monday morning, Monday afternoon at 2 OCL OCK for Motion Monday inside The Drive. I'm Matthew J. Wright, hanging up the keys and saying I'm over and out. Have a wonderful Sabbath and a fantastic weekend.
