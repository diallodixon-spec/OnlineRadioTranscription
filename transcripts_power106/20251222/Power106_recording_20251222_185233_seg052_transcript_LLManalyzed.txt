20251222 185233 We did some of our own events. So it was a good year for United Boxing Promotions as a whole. And for the new year, we've already announced our event in February back in Brampton at the CA Center. So it's about a 7,000 seat arena that we're bringing a big card to. So that'll be what our launch is. We're looking to go back to the Hard Rock Casino in Ottawa for more events. And we're just going to kind of build it out like that, maybe back down in Niagara Falls. What are your plans for this year? And even Jamaica comes up regularly with Lennox Lewis and the different connections down there that I have that want to be building boxing in Jamaica.
