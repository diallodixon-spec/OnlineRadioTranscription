20251229 205638 I'm caught up in one-night love affairs Hoping true love will find me there Caught up in one night love affairs In need of love again That's just the way I am Before I let you in There's just one thing I wanna say There's no need to pretend That this will end another way Tomorrow you'll wake up and be on your way Forget all the things you'll say tonight That's why I'm caught up in one night love affair And true love will find you there
