There's so much to do, give back, charity, you know, be a part of a foundation, their kids want, their homes that want persons to come in, you know, and spend time with the children, with the elderly. Go and do something until your time come, and your time will come, just in case they're listening. Said to Jojo, so what if she wants some to to share with someone? Oh says Jojo, So what if she wants someone to share with and nothing is wrong with her wanting to share with someone. What I'm saying is she must not question herself worth. I think that she's not worthy or something is wrong with her based on the letter that she sent. Nothing is wrong with you because you're not in a relationship. Absolutely nothing is wrong with you. It's just not your time. And maybe God is giving you an opportunity to take care of yourself.
