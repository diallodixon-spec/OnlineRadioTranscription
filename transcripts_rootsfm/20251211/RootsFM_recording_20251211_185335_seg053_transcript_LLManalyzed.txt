2025-12-12 04:39:50 Don't worry about my sorrow You'll be alone for tomorrow And you won't have to see me cry Tell me your love When you take me home Tell me your love I don't really want to spend the night alone Tell me your love I've been staring at your photograph, wondering where you're at today. And I've been hanging by the telephone, hoping that you'll come home safe.
