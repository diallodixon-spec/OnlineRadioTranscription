They don't collect or store shipment, they inspect it and somebody has to present it for inspection. So how do customs ever get so much custom then? Tracy, and the customs are alone involved in the clearance process even though it's them we tend to talk about. Look at it this way. Shipment delayed, talk to your airline agent. Missing items, talk to your freight forwarder. The charges surprise you now. Call customs. But remember to collect your sign and stamp declaration or C number from your agent. So when you call customs, them can better help you. We never too old for learning. Some miss know it all. What when customs won't hire item them now? You mean detain it? But that's only for restricted or prohibited items Tracy and in such case make sure you get a notice of detention for the restricted and seizure notice for the prohibited.
