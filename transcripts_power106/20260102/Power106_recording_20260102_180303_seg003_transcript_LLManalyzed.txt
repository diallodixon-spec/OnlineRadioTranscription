20260102 180303 We present sporting matters, sporting issues for your information, as well as for your entertainment. In the format of our program, we speak to administrators. We speak to the coaches, the athletes participating locally and internationally. And we give the same treatment to the officials, those umpires, referees, and other officials, very involved, very important, particularly in this era of really enhanced professional sport. We have features, for example, at 6.30. It is today in sports history. When we look back at an event or we highlight the performances of an administrator or for that matter an athlete having a birthday. All right, good. So that's that. Now, at 7.15 we have a did you know feature in which we present interesting kick-bass tricks.
