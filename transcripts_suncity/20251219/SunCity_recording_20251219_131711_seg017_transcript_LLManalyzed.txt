20251219 131711 Okay. Sounds very good. All right. What's the next for a worthy park estate? Well, while our pop-up town square activations continue, as I said, until March, for those of you listening, if you want to check out in Linstead, we're going to be in Linstead next week, Wednesday. So that's Christmas Eve. But outside of that, I mean, you can always check out the worthy park estate room tour. I think that's one of the easiest places for you to experience all the brands that we carry. And I know the Sun City team is all familiar with our different brands. So if you ever want to check out what Worthy Park has to offer to Jamaicans in terms of entertainment, in terms of education, definitely the Worthy Park Estate Rum Tour is where it's at. You can check us out on Instagram at WorthyParkEstateRumTour. But definitely for now, I'm going to invite you to check out our backbone page, which is Backbone Tonic Liqueur on Instagram and Facebook. And this is where you go to follow all the pop-up dates that are coming for the remaining Town Square activations. As I said, we're going to be in Lynstead next week, Wednesday.
