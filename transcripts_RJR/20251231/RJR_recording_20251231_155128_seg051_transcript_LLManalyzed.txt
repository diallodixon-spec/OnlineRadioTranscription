20251231 155128 Do you find that a lot of our anxiety about money comes from that, that avoidance? Yes, absolutely. And it goes back to the emotions around money. Persons don't usually share. And, you know, what I find is that whatever, you know, whatever person is going through regarding their finances, they feel as if they're alone. And that is not true. So, you know, finding persons who you can trust, persons who are qualified, who you can speak to, who can show you things that you probably would not otherwise have seen, will make a difference. So it's an interesting session that we have here, because when persons come into our Money Momentum program, for example, one of the first things I say to them is, you know, this is a confidential space. There's no judgment. Just know that you're going to get the help that you need. You have, you know, someone walking the journey with you.
