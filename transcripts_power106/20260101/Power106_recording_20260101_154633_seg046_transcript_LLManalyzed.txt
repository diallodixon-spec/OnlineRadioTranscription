20260101 154633 We're riding on the freeway, love and love wins against our past. We know we're ridin' on the freeway. Love and love in the pink hat and hat. We know we are riding on the free way. Love and love wins against out past. And we're ridin on the free way of love and the pink as a bag. If you mind the exercise, we've got lots of time. We can't quit until we get to the other side. Ah-ha, ah-ha, We're the radio playing a song We keep rolling along Who knows how far I can get Before you think about some love song
