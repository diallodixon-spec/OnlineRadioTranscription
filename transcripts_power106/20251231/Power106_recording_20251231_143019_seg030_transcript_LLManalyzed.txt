20251231 143019 Can't wait to hear that as well, all that and more. And when we come back from the break, we'll have our final edition of From the Archives for 2025. We're reminded of our greatest strengths, our love and resilience. In every community, in every act of care and rebuilding, that strength is on display. Vision 2030 Jamaica provides a roadmap for a secure, prosperous, and sustainable future. Together, we rebuild communities, restore hope, and move forward with confidence. Jamaica, the place of choice to live, work, raise families, and do business. Merry Christmas, Jamaica.
