I don't believe in a slave people child. But I understand you. And I don't want to use my taxes to assist the people by way of schooling, hospitals and other facilities who don't pay taxes because it makes me feel like I am still a slave working for a group of people that the slave master left in charge of farmer slaves. All right, I get that point. All right. Greetings, Dr.ervy. This is brilliant. There are people, this is beautiful sarcasm and political satire. I realize that there are people who know more about Maroon history than the Maroon themselves. Thank you, Kevin. I don't think it gets any better than that. It's true. And they don't know fly.
