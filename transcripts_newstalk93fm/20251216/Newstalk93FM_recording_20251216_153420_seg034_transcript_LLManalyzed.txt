20251216 153420 Hey, thank you for the lovely bouquet. You're sweeter than a peach, but you don't know the life of a soul girl, babe. And you're never, ever gonna wait. The more you play, the more that you pay. You're softer than father hoarded around like all men did. Her mother took pills and played tennis. So she waited by the stage door, asked the club promoter or I She said I'd sell my soul To have a taste of a magnificent life It's all mine But that's not what showgirls get They leave us for dead, hey
