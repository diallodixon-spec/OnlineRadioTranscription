20251217 193028 As time progresses, things are going to increase and changes are going to be made in terms of climate. But as we're living in a post-malice reality and as youth groups, we're doing our best to provide relief and support and so on. So as we're transitioning post-relief, I'm just looking for advice in terms of what would be the next step in terms of what areas are we overlooking, loss of education and so on and so forth. So as the lecturers and so on, what advice would you give the youth to pursue? Can I ask who you're directing that question at? Because I could easily say, minister taking it. I could see Professor Taylor taking it, I could say principal taking that, or executive director. Who would you like to challenge that question? I think the minister would be the perfect person. It's literally in his portfolio. So I think he would be the best one to take it on. Not minister of education.
