20251222 191809 I think there's a lot of lack of empathy going on and I think a lot of the people who aren't there just don't seem to understand how hard it is and what is actually happening. We're not taking this thing seriously. The government is not taking it seriously enough. Tell me what else you would want to see from them now? I would hope that I have seen the master builders and the NHC coming together, some massive building, putting on people's roof and building houses for people down there.
