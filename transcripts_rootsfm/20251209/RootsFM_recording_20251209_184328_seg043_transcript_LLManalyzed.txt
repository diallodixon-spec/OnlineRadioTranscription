============================================================

I'm looking in the right direction. Am I receiving your full attention? Or am I wasting my time? I wanna know, do you promise to love me dearly and never go away and leave me with just bitterness inside and I'm not ashamed for being so cautious for love ain't a game no it ain't a game so if I gave my heart to you what what would you do with it? Would you tear it apart, or would you look after it?
