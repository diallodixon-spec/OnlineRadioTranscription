Never do what you want if it's incomplete. Put your mind down, yeah, you're good, but I don't like shit. It's all because of you. I've never said anything. You came my way, now my life is like a sunny day. And I love you so, how much you'll never know. I don't ever take your love from me. Girl, I'm just so cute and such, you know me really like.
