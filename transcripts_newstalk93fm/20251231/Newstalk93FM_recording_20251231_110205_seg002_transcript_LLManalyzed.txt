20251231 110205 Do you wanna take a skate? On the ice inside my veins They ripped me off like false lashes And then threw me away And all the headshots on the walls Of the dance hall are of the witches Who wish I'd hurry up and die But I'm immortal now, baby does I couldn't if I tried so I say Thank you for the lovely book And now I know the life of a showgirl, babe. And I'll never know another. Hey, hidden by the lipstick and lace. Sequins are forever. And now I know life of a show girl, babe. Wouldn't have it any other way.
