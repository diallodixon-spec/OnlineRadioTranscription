In the Turks and Caicos, a sum of money stored in a security safe at Howard Hamilton International Airport has apparently gone missing. The sum is believed to be around $100,000. According to the TCI Sun, the money is from an accumulated funds confiscated from people traveling through the Providenciales International Airport with excess amounts of money among other illegal acts. The funds were to have been taken to the Treasury and deposited into a special fund. Some of it was also supposed to be turned over to the police as evidence in court cases. The sum was discovered missing over the past few days when someone went to access it as part of a court case. The Sun says at least four employees from the Turks and Caicos Islands Border Force, which has jurisdiction, will be sent on administrative leave pending the outcome of the investigation. The names are being withheld to protect the integrity of the process.
