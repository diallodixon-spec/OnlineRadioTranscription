I would love to use afro kinky To plait my own hair with it. Thanks sis. This is Margaret in St. Andrew. Hi Margaret. Unfortunately we don't braid because that would be considered braiding. But we do offer like twists with your own natural hair. If she wants to plait her own natural hair we offer that.

We do the foloxin which do have some synthetic but not the braiding. Does Just Natural give clients suggestions as to which product
