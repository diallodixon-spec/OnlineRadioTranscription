20251226 181712 Oh, baby, all I want for Christmas is you. Ooh, baby. Oh, the lights are shining so brightly everywhere. And I saw the children laugh and feel the air. And everyone is singing. I hear those loud drums, baby. Santa, won't you bring me the one I really need? Won't you bring me, baby, to meet me? Oh, I don't want a life for Christmas. This is all I'm asking for. I just want to see my baby standing right outside my door. Oh, I just want you for my own, more than you could ever know. Make my wish come true, baby, all I want for Christmas.
