They love you. Watch it, watch it. Watch the, watch the, watch the. See them if they look at me now. I'm not telling you, man. They're not holding me back. The man wants you. All right. When disaster strikes, it disrupts families, schools and entire communities. This Friday, December 19, Barita Investments Limited and FESCO invite you to help rebuild early childhood institutions impacted by Hurricane Melissa. Come out in your numbers to FESCO Beachwood Avenue. Delia is there and Delia as well. So take along your school supplies, hygiene items, baby essentials and non-perishables. Donations will also be accepted at Fesco Spanish Town Road and at Berita.
