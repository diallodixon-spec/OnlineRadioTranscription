20251231 165226 Hey, hey, hey, hey Get a superstar water where you reach for Every lyrics where you have me say I'm here for How you a tell a man feel like shot When you never get a lick yet you feel how it hot If you a warrior, tell me where you fight for And if for justice you put up for no lighter But if for vanity, jewelry and such Remember, say me, tell you, say you soon, yeah My ex-deed shall I mind me now. Naughty up your head, I worship Babylon Joe. My ex-deeds shall I mind me know. Straighten up your livin' stick and don't bow down.
