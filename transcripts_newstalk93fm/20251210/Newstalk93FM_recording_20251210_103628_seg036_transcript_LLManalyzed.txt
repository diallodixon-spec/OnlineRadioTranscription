The little girl said he is taking me away. I said I can't. I can't have a woman for you. The little girl said come baby, run. I said grab her and find him. I said come baby, come. She ran to me and I put her in the car seat and she cried and I said Matthew just start praying for the little girl and her parents and her family. Oh Jesus. She said he let me walk in the bush so that I am not seen. Just like that, she said it, she's so intelligent. She said he took my tie and he took my watch and he hide them. Oh Jesus.
