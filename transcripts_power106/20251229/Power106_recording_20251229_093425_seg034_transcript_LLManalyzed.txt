20251229 093425 I come back to our business when I go to the big story. Peter Rosall is the Managing Director of BPM Financial Limited and she now joins us to say why you must have a long-term vision or outlook next year. Good morning Peter, welcome. Hi, hi Dr. Sobelon, morning. Roger, morning. Morning Peter, how are you doing? I'm well, thank you. Okay. All right. So, Peter, you know, it's the end of another year. We're just about there and many persons are trying to figure out exactly how to approach the new year. So, and your thoughts are that it should be, we should be looking at long-term. Right. So, the thing about year-end New Year's is it gives you that opportunity to do a little reflection, gives you the opportunity to kind of reset, you know, what you were doing and assess whether it was effective going forward, do you need to make changes, that kind of thing.
