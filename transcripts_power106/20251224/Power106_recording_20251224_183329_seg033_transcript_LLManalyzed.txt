Former West Indian cricketer Roy Samuel Miller, who played in one test in 1953, was born in Kingston on the 24th of December 1924. A lower order batter and open bowler, Miller played eight matches for Jamaica between 1950 and 1954 and was selected for the fourth test against India in Georgetown in the 1952-1953 tour, replacing Jericho Best. Now batting at number eight and trying to score a quick run, he strained his back, going for a big hit and was unable to bowl in the Indian second inning. Gomez returned for the fifth test. Miller's only first-class score, higher than the 23 he made in his one-test innings, was 86 for Jamaica against British Guyana.
