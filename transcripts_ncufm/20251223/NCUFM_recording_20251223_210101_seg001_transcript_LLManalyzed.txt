20251223 210101 Today is Tuesday, December 23. I am Pastor Robert Wright. Again, we are so grateful to have you as we continue our study of God's Word. We're in the book of Joshua. Today we're looking at Free to Serve, Joshua 24. Thank you, Heavenly Father, for another beautiful day. Thank you for your grace. You're so faithful to us, Lord, and we ask that you'll help us to love you in return and be faithful to you even as you're faithful to us. Without faith it is impossible to please God. To bless us now as we study together in Jesus name. So we're looking at free to serve. Now as a true and faithful leader Joshua respects the free will of his people and wishes that Israel would serve the Lord out of free choice rather than compulsion. That was exactly the point made by the deliberate use of the verb chosen in Joshua 24 verse 22. Let me just read that.
