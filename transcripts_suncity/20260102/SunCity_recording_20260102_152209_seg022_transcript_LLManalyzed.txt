20260102 152209 I ain't got nothing to worry about, I ain't got nothin' to worry about. Talkin' too ordinary, nothin' to check. Puttin' away the wrong side, I don't know where it's from So strong when it ain't, I'm not not too weak When it ain't I'm not no way, when it ain't I not no way babe Nothin' in a single, it must can rip me Y'all break me, y'all make me Y'all still in style, smell me fragrance in my mind Acid me and y'all listen, me shout all the while Trash and love, pleasure with position and style I sure want somebody who will f*** me down Some of you don't want it, but I remember it so well I'll die and then fall right asleep I'll be everlasting f***ing physical
