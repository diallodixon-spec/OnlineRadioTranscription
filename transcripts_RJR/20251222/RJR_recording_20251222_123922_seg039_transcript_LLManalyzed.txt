20251222 123922 about the stakeholders not wanting to inject a further scent. I haven't seen anything to that regard. I've heard talk, but I haven't see anything concrete in that regard though. It would be strange because they are making a profit every year, you know. All right, so let's see. The fact to find that part out about the stakeholders, because you know it is owned by Mary Bennie, East West power out of Korea, and also we have a 20% interest there. So, if I know what that is, we didn't hear about it, they want to put another penny in, they have invested a lot, but it would be foolhardy if you're making profit, they would think of the size that JPS is making or to want to continue. I'm used to silver-rattling, I's part of it too negotiations are going on so what can I tell you all right let's look at another whatsapp message let me bring it up here this one says good day Mr. Boyle must keep them animal populacy close they won't eat
