============================================================

You gotta let it go, you gotta let it go Subconscious clogged with pensive thoughts Decisions to make at night and side But Father God fill my heart with virtue Like an eagle, feel like flying high High from all my problems, tension Broken heart and mixed emotion Who can add hour to their life by worrying? When will you learn to be anxious for nothing? Let it go. Oh, oh, oh. Stop worrying, stressing me. Just take it slow. Take it slow. Release your heart.
