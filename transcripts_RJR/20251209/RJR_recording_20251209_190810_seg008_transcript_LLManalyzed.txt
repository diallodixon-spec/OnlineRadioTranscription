or dance music and food and even or special people okay so what about dance what about jamaican dance or or food do you really like my favorite jamaican dance is the kumina. It is so lively, so entertaining and so fun to dance to. My favorite meal in Jamaica is the curry chicken. I like to eat it with either white rice or rice and peas. All right, so tell me, Brianna, suppose I took you up now and I put you down in the middle of New York Square or in London or in Paris around people who don't know you, who have never been to Jamaica.
