Steps are also being taken to resume normal operations under the Southern Plains Agricultural Development Project, SPAD, as quickly as possible in the aftermath of Hurricane Melissa. Project manager Wayne Williams says while primary roads and pump houses remained intact after the storm, some secondary roads suffered significant damage, with initial repair costs estimated at just over 10 million Jamaican dollars. Additionally, land clearing for fallen trees is projected to cost another five million dollars. This bad project is geared at improving agricultural production and productivity in St. Catherine and Clarendon. It saw the upgrade of irrigation and drainage networks, roads and post-harvest handling facilities on government-owned lands in Amity Hall and Bridge Plains, St. Catherine and Pardnassos in Clarendon
