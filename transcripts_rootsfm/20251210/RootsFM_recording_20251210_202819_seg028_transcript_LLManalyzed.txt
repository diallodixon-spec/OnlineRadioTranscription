============================================================

I want you to get it right, child. I won't always be here for you. So do yourself, always be be true And if you get lost, use your inner light, child Shine it and don't come down Don't feast your eyes on the things that are on the ground. And if it gets hard to focus when you're traveling almost at this speed of sound, you're nowhere bound. Almost there.
