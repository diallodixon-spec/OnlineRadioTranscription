20260102 203918 How do you feel about it? Try to control me, boy, you'll get this missed. I pay my own funnel and I pay my own bills. Always 50-50 in relationships. It's you on my feet. I party. The clothes I'm wearing. I party. Rock I'm rockin'. I party. I depend on me if I want it. The watch I'm wearin', I party. The house I live in, I party. The car I'm driving, I party. I depend on me, I depend on me. All the women, women dependent. Throw your hands up at me. All the hunnids, making money. Throw your hand up at me. I'm part of my bus, profit, dollar. Throw your hand, up at me. The other ladies, usually feel bad. Throw your hands, up at me! Girl, I didn't know you could get down like that. Just get down like that, girl. Like the end, oh, you could down like that. Your angels could down like that, how you feel about this?
