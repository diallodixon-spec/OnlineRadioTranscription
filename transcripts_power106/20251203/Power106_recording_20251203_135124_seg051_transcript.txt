I don't know if people think they sound brighter when they say persons and treat with, but trust me, it doesn't impress me none at all. I prefer you just come out and talk like Warmington. By the way, do you know Warmington was in the speaker's chair yesterday? I prefer you to come speak Patwa rather than you try to speak his spoke and talk about persons and treat with and would have and what not. But we need to stop this treat with and persons business and pick up a dictionary. And you say Simon, Franco comes from a place far away called America.
