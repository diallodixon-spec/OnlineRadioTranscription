20251229 125124 I will be your hero, your strength, anything you need. I will be the sun in your sky. I will let you wait for all time. Promise you, for you I will be like this. I will shield your heart from the rain. I won't let no harm come to aid. All these arms will be your shelter. And all these arms will let you down. If there is a mountain to move, I will move that mountain for you. I'm here for you, I'm here forever. I will be your fortress, tall and strong.
