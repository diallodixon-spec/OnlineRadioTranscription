You're looking for trouble, and I'd say you found it You'll have to come right through me, there's no way around it I hope that lean hungry look made what it's saying But I'm just sitting on already, ready and waiting. Baby, make your move. Step across the line. Touch me one more time. Come on, dare me. I want to take you on. I know I can't lose.
