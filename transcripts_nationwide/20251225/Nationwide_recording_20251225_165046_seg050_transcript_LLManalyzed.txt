20251225 165046 You've got a wife and some lovely kids As for me, I may try to live a life Lucky you, you've got a woman to go home to I've got to find me myself a woman What I wouldn't do now Ain't nothing funny Sitting there making fun of me Just because you've got your kids and you're on me You've got money, that's good for you Man, your life must be so happy Now I'm on the other end I'm here trying to live a life that's yet to end Having a family would be so nice It would be a joy to me to find a lady Who would bring a baby boy for me or a girl for me With many words, lucky You've got a woman to hold on to To linger No time to linger
