You find that with the development sale agreements, the developer is the one who provides the surveils identification and sometimes the valuation reports. So you may not get those until the end of the transaction or close to the end of the transactions. So in order to get your mortgage application started, the developer's attorney will give their undertaking or their promise to provide those reports when the title is ready. So that's closer to the end of the transaction. When you're buying an already existing building, let's say, your surveyor or your valuer can come in and provide these reports. So you get those in a couple of days or a couple of weeks. So really the main difference between developments right into a development or buying an already existing building is the time. Developments take a longer time, take a longer time
