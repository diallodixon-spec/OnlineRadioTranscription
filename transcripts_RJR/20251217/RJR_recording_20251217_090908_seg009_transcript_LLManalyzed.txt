20251217 090908 I couldn't help but to silently wonder whether we can and should encourage and implore government to become more efficient and they have been in some areas in recent times and in becoming more efficient, I wonder whether there are some areas that should be really controlled by government.

Are we at a point where serious consideration needs to be given by government?
