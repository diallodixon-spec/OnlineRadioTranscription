20251223 102013 No, no. Who? The Custard, Lennox, and this Jackson's grandmother dead. She's 97 years old. I said all the years I called the lady Mrs. Lovey. I never knew she was Mrs. Lovey anymore. Until the years ended. Oh, look. Yes. So we held out from Greenland United Church up there. You understand me? So I said condolences to the family, each and every one. And listen, pretty nice womanrika. She goes to the church there, big round there. Remember, Ms. Nubby is a good wife. May her soul rest in peace.
