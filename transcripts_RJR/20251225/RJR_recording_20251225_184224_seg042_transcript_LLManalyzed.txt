20251225 184224 There is just one thing I need Don't care about the present Underneath the Christmas tree I don't need to end my stocking Never call the fireplace Santa Claus won't make me happy I'll make a toy on Christmas day I just want you for my own More than you could ever know Oh You made me fall I won't ask for much this Christmas I won't even wish for snow I'm just gonna keep on waiting Oh, I need this little song I'm gonna make a list and send it to you
