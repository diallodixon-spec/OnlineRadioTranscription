20260101 173216 Need it when I'm colder In my life There's been a heartache and pain I don't know if I can face it again Can't stop now I've traveled so far To change this lonely life. I want to know what love is. I want you to show me. I want to feel love is. I know you can show me Even if you were a million mile away I can still feel you in my bed Near me, touch me, feel me
