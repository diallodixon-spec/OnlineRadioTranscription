Dr. Taylor, the government has some on their website, I think one of the ministry websites, I think it's technology about how to install some of these things. So it's how to install safely Starlink. And there has been a full campaign as well as how to safely use a generator, because unfortunately, we've had some deaths because of the unsafe use of generators. So please, I'm imploring our consumers to assist persons. You know, and I'm thinking, Dorothy, that I know the information is out there, but, um, maybe we need to put out after the hurricane, uh, maybe a 10 point bullet by bullet set of do's and don't do in the post hurricane.
