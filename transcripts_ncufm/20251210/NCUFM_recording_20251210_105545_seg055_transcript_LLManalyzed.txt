Your name is great That's why my heart is filled with praise Love me in your arms You are my shelter from the storm When all my friends are gone You were right there all along And I've never known love I've never believed in peace at all Before I just wanna say The night that I cried, you loved me When I should have died, you loved me I'll never know why you loved me Loved me
