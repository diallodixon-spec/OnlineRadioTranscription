20251219 143225 As a fitness guy, I was surprised by my chronic illness diagnosis. I thought working out hard I would fix it, but I love. Then I decided not to let any disease get the best of me. And I'm, we are rebuilding together. The government is mobilized, field hospitals are open, roads are clearing and aid is reaching every corner. If you have been affected, help is on the way. Stay strong, stay informed.
