4 months so the HbA1c test shows the average blood sugar for the past 3 to 4 months so the significance of a reading of 9% well it means that your sugar is not controlled and to be less confusing what that means is that your estimated average blood sugar level over about say three months is about 11.8 millimoles per litre. You know there's an equation to work that out. So we want this number to be less than 7.8%. Now that number would indicate that your sugar is controlled. So the long and short is that if you see that your blood, your glycosylated hemoglobin is 9, it means something is wrong.
