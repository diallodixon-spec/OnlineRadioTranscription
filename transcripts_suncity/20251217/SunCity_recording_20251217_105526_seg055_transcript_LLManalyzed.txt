My People don't fuss, My People don't fight. Oh, we should all unite. My People Don't fight. Don't worry, my people, don't you ever forget. Give John the glory with every single step that you take now. So don't you worry, my people. Don't you ever forget, no, no, no. Give God the glory with every single breath that you take now. God love, higher than the mountain.
