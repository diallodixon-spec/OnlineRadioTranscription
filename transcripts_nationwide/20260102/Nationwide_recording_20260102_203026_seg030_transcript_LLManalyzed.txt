20260102 203026 you said i used to do the um the information technology degree so you must know that arrays are storage location that's right so she was she took the egg trays to class just to teach them you know how to name the array how to count the spaces in the egg tray and how to relate that to the array section of the syllabus yeah i i mean trust me you have to find different methods of bringing across the point as you go through the syllabus. And, you know, that's a bigger conversation when it comes on to the whole matter of data structures, because I mean, that was a course itself in IT as well. But one of the things too, you know, is that in life, what I like about courses or subjects that we do is that there there no matter what your career path may be you'll find that there's some kind of principle or lesson that you can take whether it's from it or social studies or even mathematics
