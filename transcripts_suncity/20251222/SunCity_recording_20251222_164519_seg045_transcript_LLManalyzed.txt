You know, we were spared, especially on our end here, we were spared the wrath of Melissa. And so this Christmas, invite your family, extended family who is in the country, invite them to come up. We don't have to go to a country this Christmas. Make them come to Kingston, make them come to Polkmore and just have a good time. They're down there, you know what I mean? We are seeing the horror stories and we're seeing everything that's happening, but whatever we can do to help out, help out. And whatever you can do to just make the kids have fun, do it. A lot of corporate has done some stuff with us going into the Christmas. So there were a couple of treats that we did and it just really made us feel good about, you know, being able to participate in something like that and see the smile on the kids' faces. And yeah, so come on, we're going to invite the people from the country and come up.
