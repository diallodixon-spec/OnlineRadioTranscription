20251226 140608 I don't live my life with regrets, no. I come to jam on a bumper, pump to drink all the liquor. Until my head gone and I'm miserable. All down on the ground, I'm causing trouble. Look how the security watch me. They don't know I'm out there. And they smash up the place, and I defect like a zombie. I don't wait. They don't want me in there for a cheating. They know all because I do one way. They know all me in there for cheating. I don't listen to nothing they say. Every fact I draw, jumping up, doing what I want. Jumping up, tell them I ain't leaving. Right there, sleeping. Every fact that draw, jumping up. Doing what I want, jumping up, Tell them I ain't livin' Right they are sleepin' Every fact I draw Doin' what i want Tell them i ain't livin Right they are sleeping Sometimes I just tell you I pull myself But I can't ease the tension Too much affectin' woman
