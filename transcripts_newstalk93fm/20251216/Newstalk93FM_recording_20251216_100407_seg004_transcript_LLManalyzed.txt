It's so bad that the Energy Policy Institute estimates residents lose more than eight years of their lives here because of the pollution. The smog is so thick that this week airlines cancelled dozens of flights and delayed many more to and from the capital. Delayed flights included one that the soccer star Lionel Messi was meant to board on Monday to Delhi. He was on a tour of India. Local media reported it also delayed the departure of the Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi for an overseas tour. The Indian government says it's taking action, including a ban on open-air grills used for charcoal chicken and tandoori bread. Critics say it's not enough.
