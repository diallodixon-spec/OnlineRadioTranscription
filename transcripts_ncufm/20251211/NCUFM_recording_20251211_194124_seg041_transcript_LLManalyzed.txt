2025-12-12 12:35:53 I believe our test is right. God has been good to me. Through every test and trial, I've got the victory. The enemy is trying as best to make me turn around and bring me down. But my God has never failed me yet, so I'm gonna stand my ground. No matter what comes my way, I'll lift my voice and say Hallelujah anyhow! Praying it one more time, because I'll say it again God's doing so good to me, He's my closest friend I've come too far to turn hope from now I'm gonna stand, I'm gonna wait, watch God work it out somehow No matter what comes my way I'll lift my voice and say Hallelujah anyhow
