with you, Ingrid, can you just, first of all, give us a working definition. What exactly is intestacy and why is it such a common problem in Jamaica? Certainly. So, intestacy is the situation where you have not made a will. And therefore, legislation or an act would determine who your beneficiaries are. So once there's no will, then we have what you call the Inter-States Estates and Property property charges act that determines who the beneficiaries are. And so I don't, you wanted me to go through and indicate like who the spouse and the different persons in terms of the categories of person that will be beneficiaries?
