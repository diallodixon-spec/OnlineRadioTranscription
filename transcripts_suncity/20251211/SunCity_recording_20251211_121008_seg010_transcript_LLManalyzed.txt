It's now time for your regional news. Guyana and the United States have signed a statement of intent to deepen joint military cooperation. The agreement reaffirms a shared commitment to regional peace, sovereignty, and security in the Western Hemisphere. It was signed on Tuesday following a meeting between President Dr. Irfan Ali and the senior officials of the U.S. Department of War. President Ali explained that the statement of intent is part of a broader, evolving U.S. security strategy branded Southern Spare. He says the collaboration would not result in any deployment of U.S. troops to Guyana. That's it for our regional news. Up next is international news.
