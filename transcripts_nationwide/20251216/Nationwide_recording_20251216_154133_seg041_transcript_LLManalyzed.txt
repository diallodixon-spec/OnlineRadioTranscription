20251216 154133 My love goes stronger each day Don't hurt me just because you know I like it so, brother like I made you stop but you love I can't go on, no Now it's getting so dark I'm stuck right here, I can't move And the feeling shows Come the fire, I've traveled the wrong way Oh, hills and highways I've had some bad days Now I'm resting right here at your mercy Can't you see the look in my eyes? Red light, oh please don't change on me Now don't you turn to green I'm tired, if you change I think I'll scream
