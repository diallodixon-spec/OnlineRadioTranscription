20251212 120204 It's now time for the weather update. The significant feature is a trough across Jamaica. The weak trough is expected to remain across the island through the weekend. Additionally, expect windy conditions across sections of the island through to Sunday due to a low-level jet stream across the central Caribbean. Now for the three-day forecast. Starting tomorrow, Saturday should be partly cloudy in the morning across eastern parishes. Otherwise, it should be mainly sunny. Look out for isolated afternoon showers across western parishes.
