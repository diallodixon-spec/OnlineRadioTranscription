20251212 104632 Talk to me, talk to me Be the man that I need, baby I'd like to think you feel the same way But I can't tell with you sometimes So baby let's get on the same page Stop making me read between the lines Already know I can't leave it alone You're on my mind Already gave you the time and the place, so don't be shy. Just come be the man I need. Tell me you've got something to give, I want it. I kind of like it when you call me wonderful.
