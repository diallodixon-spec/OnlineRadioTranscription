Listen to me, I put some carrots in your hand. Make this, this, this, I'm gonna put it in. Wanna give, give, I serve it like it, like it. Keep it, keep it, uh, uh, n-n-n-n. I'm baking your bird, it can't feel get sweeter. Feel my body banging like speaker. Touch your toes now. Rip your down, down. Strip a pose now. Touch your toes. Rip your down.
