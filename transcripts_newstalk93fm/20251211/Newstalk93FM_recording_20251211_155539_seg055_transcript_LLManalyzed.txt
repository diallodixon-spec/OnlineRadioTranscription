2025-12-12 09:38:28 I'm shaking at my feet. Feel a weight upon my shoulder. You're my rescue. You're my remedy. Everything about you frees me. I relax and take it easy. Cause you give me hope, hope. You're like the morning sun and I'm not alone. You give me hope. Hope. You're like a sunrise. No, I'm not afraid cause you give me hope When I walk on sinking sand Feeling lonely in a crowd When everything's pulling in
