20251229 090205 I guess my life go look for mine Never sell me school, me settle down and take me time Do it for the love so naturally the lights are shine Now me realize it's my design When I look at where I'm coming from Looking back at where the journey begun A million of you say that I'm strong, I'm strong All praises to the most I want Can I tell you where I'm coming from? Looking back at where the journey began I really have to say that I'm strong I'm strong I'll resist A piece of bread man, rich and caked Remember when you got there so you know fi ever left But while you off a child, you might a crush up like a file Still you better go and burn the midnight tile It won't be an easy road But anytime you overcome the pressure, yeah it frees all Cause you will never give me more than I can bear
