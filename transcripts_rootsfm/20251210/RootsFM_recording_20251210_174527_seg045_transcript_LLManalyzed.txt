very merry christmas wherever you may be is for christmas the season of good cheer Is for happiness, to last you through the years R is for respect, that each and all should show In this holy season, wherever you may go is for indulgence, to know how far to go. S is for Santa Claus, the children all do know. T is for toys, for little girls and boys.
