20251215 162922 want to be there, but it's just my responsibility as mother really pulled me away from that. So sometimes I look back at it and I'm like, well, you know, I wish I had that opportunity to really set that foundation. So I wasn't really there. So balance is tricky. It is always at every point ensuring that I'm doing whatever is priority in the moment. And in that season, it was to ensure that our two young kids were a year apart, 13 and 14, but then they're much younger. I had to do what I had to do to hold things down there in the home. Likewise, when he has to travel overseas, it's not like I don't want to go with him. I really don't want to. I want those opportunities. I want experience. I want exposure. But I don't get that because I am holding down things at home. So sometimes the balance isn't really there or balance really just looks like what do I need to prioritize? No. Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely. Oh my gosh. Oh, you are so blessed. We'll be right back. Yeah.
