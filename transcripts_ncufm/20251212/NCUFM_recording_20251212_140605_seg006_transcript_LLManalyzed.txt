20251212 140605 Check, check, check, testing, testing. Happy Flashback Friday. It's December 12th. and I just want to say Happy Anniversary to my driver, M-I-C-A-L Forsyte, and your beautiful wife, Boss Lady Johnalee Forsyte. Pray that God will continue to bless your union. Cheers to love! Lovin' her, lovin' her. Lovin' her. So enjoyining myself. I hope Melissa didn't spoil up y'all's plans. But I know you'll leave us in good hands. So I'm assuming our chauffeur, Matthew J. Wright, has the key to the bus. So whoever it is, I'm in my seat. I'm ready to go.
