20251225 205632 Christmas is a time for love, a time for giving and sharing. A time when children be with joy. They'll seem to know that someone's caring. You should know the greatest gift is free. That's a love given willingly. It's so easy. You don't need money, no. Give a little love, give a little love. Give love is Christmas.
