20251222 170406 I'm not coming home tonight. I'm not coming home tonight Don't sign the party, I'll go send no third party to find me I'm not going home tonight, not coming home tonight I'm drunk in the party, so I don't think no third party can find me I was grabbed by the melodies, now the liquor take all of me And the bass knock my soul out, I'm at your soak, I won't let you leave I don't know if I'll survive Song after song, wine after wine I go sing strong and fit for life Weak like the masses, kryptonites You can't find me, we're bound for shaking I admit it, people bet it
