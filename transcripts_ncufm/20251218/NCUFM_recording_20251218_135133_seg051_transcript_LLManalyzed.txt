And the positives are few and far between The hate, the greed, the jealousy, this world is filled with sin But a better life's remaining to be seen I have seen a lot of disappointing things in my own life It's impossible to do what's right it seems It's grieving me to see in our hearts bitterness and strife But a better life's remainin' to be seen When I see Jesus I will know Him by the male scars in His hand When I see Jesus, I will know that I have reached a promised land I'll see His glory in the eyes
