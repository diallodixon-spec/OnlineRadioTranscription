20251212 210000 before we go I have to say big up to uncle David he was locked in from last week and he said that he's always on your program and so we just want to leave that part of the program this evening when we when we come back next week, winding down the syllabus, heading into the holidays, but we will certainly have another subject that we'll be turning our focus on. And I just want to leave this quote with us that a well-organized database is like a library where every book has its place. Spreadsheets help you to calculate but databases help you to understand and manage information efficiently. I want to say thank you so much to our technical operator, Andrew Anderson, our executive producer, Dennis Brooks. I'm tuning out, Damon Scarlett. Enjoy your weekend and see you next week.
