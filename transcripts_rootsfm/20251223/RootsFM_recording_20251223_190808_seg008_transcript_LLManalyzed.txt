20251223 190808 In a gunman life He might not come home from work one night So every minute matter ignores advice From his weeping baby mother and child That he won't in every game he plays So she know he'll make his end one day Some juvenile will have to whirly strike And have to take another gunman's life What if a box of her names is Christ? And how ironic if him dead from night The amount of bullets where him put pump wild Chop the strips and kill and destroy Now tell me is it worth it all? If one don't rise then the next must fall Tell me is it it worth it all? If one don't rise, then the next must fall. Tell me, is worth it all? Those sleepless nights on patrol roll call. Tell me is worth it all. One child smile while the next one ball. Tell me is it worth it? Is it worth it?
