20251222 091911 Contentment is one of those words we don't hear very often but it's something we all crave especially in season like this when some of us are surrounded by plenty and others are stretching what little they have. Some are working long hours even on theth, while families and others are on final break. The promise we hold onto is this, God gives us strength to live with peace and contentment in every season. Not just the easy ones, not just the joyful ones, but every season. Think about that for a second. Contentment isn't about the size of your paycheck, the number of gifts under a tree, or even how much free time you have.
