============================================================

On Christmas Day Every little child on Santa's knee Has room for your love underneath their tree Give love on Christmas day. Every time you hear me, graceful and secure. Needs heart, needs a mind that's just as much as you. Give love on Christmas Day. No rain again, if there's enough. What the world needs.
