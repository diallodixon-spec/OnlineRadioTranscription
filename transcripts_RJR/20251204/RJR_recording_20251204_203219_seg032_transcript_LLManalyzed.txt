It's current, informative, educational, and it deals with the issues. It's Teacher's Time. Coming up in Teacher's Time, Sunday, December 7th, 2025, join us as we present what is likely to be the final conversation series with JTA President Mark Malava for this year preceding his Christmas message as we enter the Christmas period. Your president will have so much to share, especially during this difficult period. So, please pay attention to the date and tune in Sunday, December 7th for our next Teachers Time program, which is within our 15-minute allotted time on this station, Radar Jamaica 94 FM. Teachers Time, brought to you by Jamaica Teachers' Association, Unite and Serve, and the JTA Cooperative Credit Union Limited, serving our members, impacting lives positively.
