I said I'm Mr. DJ, play that one again Well this a reggae music where the people dem depend on From now till a mornin' vibes in all the end Nothin' derogative a strictly message I have sent Reggae music make you dance and reggae music make you smile I be skankin' to the rhythm from when I was a little child From Bambali and the whale I set the pattern and the style, to supercats where lyrics just flow like river nile. Have to pick up all the sound, them that been doing it for a while. King Jamin's and Stone Love, them on the lead in Bayamai, them take the music round the world, and them make the sacrifice to put Jamaica on the top. Now everyone touch the style and say, hey, Mr. DJ, play that one again. Well, this is reggae music where the people them defend And from now till the morning vibes not go in I love to see the uptown and get the people blend I'm Mr. D.J. play that one again This is reggae music Where the people them defend From now till the morning
