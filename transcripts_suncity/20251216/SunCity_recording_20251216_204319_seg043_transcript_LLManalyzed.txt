20251216 204319 I don't want to call my baby or wipe the tears from my eyes. Make me a proud mother. Let me see you grow to be a man. This is all I ask of you. I hope you understand. Talk to yourselves. Talk to them. Reason with them. I love you all. So all I ask of you is please stand tall. Stand tall.
