Motorists are being promised a modern roadway, supported by round-the-clock park controls and ongoing maintenance. TJH says a toll rate structure will be implemented at both the Main Line Toll Plaza and the Ramp Toll Plaza to support the delivery of these services. Under the announced rates, Class 1 vehicles will pay $480, Class 2 vehicles $720, and Class 3 vehicles $1400. TTAG users will benefit from slightly reduced rates and automatic frequent user discounts, including a free 10th trip through each toll plaza every week.
