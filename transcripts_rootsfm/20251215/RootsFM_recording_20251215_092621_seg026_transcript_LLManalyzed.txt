20251215 092621 Remember the first day When you called my house Remember the first day when you took me out We had butterflies, although we tried to And we both had a beautiful night The way we held each other's hand The way we talked, the way we laughed It felt so good to find true love I knew right then and there you were the one I know that he loves me cause he told me so I know that he loved me cause it's still in show When he's asking me, you see he can't ask for me. You see how he's so deep in love. I know that he loves me, because it's obvious. I know he loves me, cause it's me he trusts. And he's missing me, if he's not kissing me.
