20251229 105734 Meditation One day things must get better Don't you go down, keep your head above that water One day, things must get better Be strong and appalled, with a firm meditation One day, thing must get better, don't you go down Keep your head above the water, say One day, things must get better. The rich is wise in his own conceit, but the poor with over-standing surges him out. Poor man mourn the rich riches in Greece. I say, be he not grieved, riches are not for ever.
