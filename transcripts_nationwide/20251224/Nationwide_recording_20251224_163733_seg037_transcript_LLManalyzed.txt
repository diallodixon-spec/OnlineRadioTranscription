20251224 163733 That, that, that, that is true Let my words be, pick one life journey Let me lay you down And if life journey, should break us girlie Shoulda wear a frown Land takes up places, I miss your face I need the changes With you I'm safe I know my brain is out for brighter days I will keep on loving you Love you a lot to say Oh, I'll find a way To let my words be Take on my life journey, let me lay you down And it's life journey to make us happy We should walk in the way I found Fight fire, throw my feet when I sigh
