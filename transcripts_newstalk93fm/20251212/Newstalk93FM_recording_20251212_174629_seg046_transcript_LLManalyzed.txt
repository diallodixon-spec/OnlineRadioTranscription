20251212 174629 Oh, gosh. But everybody's trying to talk to me, and nobody's trying to hear me out. So you've got some things to say, and this week, it's just a movie mount. The things you say, it makes no sense, and we're not at a time to figure it out. Leave me alone. It's best you just leave me out. See, what I'm trying to say is that this caused me so much pain. Feeling like I've got no control over my own break. When it's sad to see that you don't see, it's driving me insane. Leave me alone. Oh, yes. Right here now, no for them to get blocked and delete. Airplane mode out of life, you're so sweet. Come and bring off me line, seven days at the wheel. Oh, me know fi right now, me know fi sweet. Leela beg you this, Leela beg you that. Hey, shut your shh. Hey, cut the crap, 20, 29.
