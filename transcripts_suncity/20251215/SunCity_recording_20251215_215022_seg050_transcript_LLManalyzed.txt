20251215 215022 It's your boy Snoop D-O-Double G re's kinda hard being Snoopy or Double G But I somehow, someway Keep coming up with funky ass hits Like every single day May I kick a little something for the G's And make a few hands as I breeze through Two in the morning and the 40's still jumpin' cause my mama ain't home I got some freaks in the living room gettin' it on And they ain't leavin' till six in the mornin' So what you gonna do? I got a pocket full of ruffles in my home, boys do too So turn off the lights and close the door But we don't love them though So we gonna blow a house to this Geez, I freeze up for a second, now bounce to this
