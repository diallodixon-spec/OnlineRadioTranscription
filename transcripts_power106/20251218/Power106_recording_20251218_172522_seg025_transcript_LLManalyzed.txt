20251218 172522 It's usually from sound pressure oscillating at a certain frequency and amplitude, right? That means it looks like a way like a graph. We have a graph in mathematics where you'd have an XY axis. So think about you going up in a curve and down below that X axis. So let's think of the top one would be the positive, the bottom one would be the negative. If you were to take the negative. If you had a positive wave, whatever shape, and you were to take a very similar pattern and put it right under that positive pattern, but in the negative, what it would do is cancel the waveform. So that's exactly what the manufacturers have done. They're putting microphones and little speakers in specific areas in the car to pick up whether it's, you know, wind noise, road noise, whatever noise, noise from sound waves being carried
