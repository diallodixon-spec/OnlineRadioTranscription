20251224 141411 I hear the church bells ringing Children's choir singing Christmas songs are playing on repeat I could go wherever But if we're not together It just won't feel like Christmas time to me. I can walk on Broadway, buy a ticket to the ballet, see them lighting up the Rockefeller tree. But every New York minute is lost without you in it It just won't feel like Christmas time to me I could fly to London, London, when Santa's lost his heart
