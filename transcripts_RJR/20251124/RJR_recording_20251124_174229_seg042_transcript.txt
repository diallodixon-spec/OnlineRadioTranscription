all together, sure, but I know that we fall under the Ministry of Justice, so I would want to say that it is more the remit of the Ministry of Justice. Because I'm not so sure that it is the court administration that rented the premises in the plaza in Manchester. I think, you know, probably such a large undertaking would be the ministries and not the court administration. Well, we'll certainly follow up with both of them to see if we can get something. But also, was there ever a suggestion that perhaps the trial simply be moved to somewhere with a courtroom that could accommodate everybody? I think we did have that discussion before, one of the learned judges of the Circuit Court at some time. But when you think about it, that all the accused are living in Clarendon.
