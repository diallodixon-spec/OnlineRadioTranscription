20251222 100506 Don't let me down easy if you're gonna leave me baby go and leave me all the way Don't ask for all your things back cussing out my name yeah Just to go and take back what you say Burn all the bridges, don't ask for forgiveness Walk away like I'm someone you hate Don't let me down easy If you're gonna leave me baby baby, go and leave me all the way If it's over, it's over, so f*** it Just don't act like my love wasn't nothin' Like I wasn't the one you was holdin' that night Tellin' all of your secrets and huggin' Guess you're right, it's too good to be true Was the point, all I needed was you But time after time, I was fussin' and fightin' It's time that you do what you do And it's cool, mama said it was fishin' to see I got a lot for you
