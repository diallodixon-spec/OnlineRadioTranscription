20260102 181507 A container of chicken washed ashore in Hellshire in St Catherine in April. The Ministry of Agriculture urged the members of the public not to eat, sell or distribute the chicken. Michael Williams is director of environmental health in the Ministry of Health. The fact that the container fell from the ship and was at sea for a day or two meant that the meat was exposed to temperatures which can cause the growth of harmful bacteria. But the residents who cleaned out the container of chicken were unrepentant. I get a lot. I share it with my neighbours. You know, and it's enjoyable. I get about 14 boxes. I don't have a problem with them. Same day I fry, same day I dry.
