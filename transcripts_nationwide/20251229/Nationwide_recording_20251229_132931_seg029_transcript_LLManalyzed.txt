20251229 132931 Together we can make it Our love is much too young to break it Oh, all I ever wanted Was to have you to myself And I see you standing there In the arms of someone else Ooh, you know a girl can stand so much And it's more than I could pay I can't let you go Every time I look at you I still can feel it glow Let it be, let it go Without me, please Just a little bit longer Together we can make it Our love is much too young to break Love me please
