Is there another version of you that we don't get to see publicly? I think I give all versions of myself on TikTok. Sometimes I'm very humble whenever there's some evil because I started out this way where I am everybody used to come to me for some form of helps. Like they want to know how to use the app if they have any problem, if they have any troubles, they want somebody to just talk to somebody to vent to. I was actually that go to guy where people can just come to me and just vent and talk and stuff like that. Yeah. So that's like my calm side yeah yeah but you know it's things kind of change you because as they can see people like we just pick from people and when them things are you like you're too soft them just feel like them want to deal with it anyway so yes that is when now i show them that yo i'm not somebody to play with i can't answer
