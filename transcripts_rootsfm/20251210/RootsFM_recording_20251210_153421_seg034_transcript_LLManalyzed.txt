to you. Thank you so much for choosing us as your number one choice. And as you know, couldn't have done it without you. And keep that Adira Truth, and dive into the issues that matter, bringing in voices from every generation. Adjust the Truth. Critical discussions on issues of life, each Wednesday afternoon at 5.30. Here, only with Roots Allergy which is the in-week thriller from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. Sorry sir, it never got to our week and we have proof for thought, your health is a well, then love boss, love boss, that is a must. And a idiot, idiot, idiot thing that they will close it off at the end of the week.
