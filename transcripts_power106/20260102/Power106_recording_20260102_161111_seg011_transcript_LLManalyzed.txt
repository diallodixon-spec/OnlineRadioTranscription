20260102 161111 that only about 20% of the Jamaican population is married. In the last few days, news out of China is that due to their drastic decline in the population, the government is imploring their citizens to marry and have more children, not to just have more children, but to get married as well. Not that Jamaicans don't divorce, but a stable family life is so important to the children we produce and hence a more stable nation. It can help in the reduction of the crime rate if there's a stable household and not one in which our women folk produce children with several different fathers. Very, very true. I agree with that. Yes, I agree with that yeah stable homes I mean as Neville said as Neville said though right we need to have more social cohesion
