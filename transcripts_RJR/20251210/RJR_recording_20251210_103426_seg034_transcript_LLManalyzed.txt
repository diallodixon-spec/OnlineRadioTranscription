until I totally came off grid, till getting these observant amount of light bill. Went through the process. They said I should write a letter. I did just that. I did everything that I was asked to do. But yet still, they kept on sending me the high bills. Then one day I got a call that my account is in arrears and my light is being turned off. I was like, okay, but I'm not missing the light because I'm on solar system and I've said this before. And you guys still keep tending me bills. So apparently bills were being estimated? For a year? I don't know. Yeah. That's what I'm telling from 2018. I know we're in 2025. Yes. So that estimated bill is going on for quite a long time. Yeah, okay. Have you ever really raised it with OUR? Yeah, I did. I took it more than once. Is it OUR you said? I took it to OUR. I've written to OUR.
