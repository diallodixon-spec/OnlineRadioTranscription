============================================================

Something happens that I can't describe But it helps me to survive Like magic, like something in the air You can feel it, close your eyes now And your heart will take you there Just let it take you there We don't have to take a walk We could spend the night all night. Not a word from your lips. You just don't forget that I want to stay with you.
