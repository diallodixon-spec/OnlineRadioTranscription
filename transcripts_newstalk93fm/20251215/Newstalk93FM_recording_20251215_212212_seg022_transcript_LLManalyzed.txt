20251215 212212 I can't get over it So don't you ever Let me down again Cause I'm depending on you So you better come through this time Please hear my cry and if I ever Let you down my friend It was a misunderstanding So if I took it for granted Then I promise from today I'll go drunk, like I never drunk Waved like I never waved, whined like I never wanted to Just to show you I'm sorry, I'm sorry And I need you back in my life Look at people buying a truck Emotions running high We are not in the sky Taste running down we high Can't you tell that we sorry We sorry And we need you back in we high
