20251224 175339 I just want to pull my own More than you could ever know Make my wish come true All I want for Christmas is you Baby Although I won't ask for much this Christmas I won't even wish for snow. I'm just gonna keep on waiting. I'm gonna make a list and send it to the North Pole for Saint Nick. I won't ever say I'll wait too long. With a magic rain they play. Cause I just want you in you. Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.
