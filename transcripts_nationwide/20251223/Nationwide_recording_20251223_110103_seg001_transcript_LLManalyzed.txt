20251223 110103 Lisa, it is so good to see you. But sorry you catch me like this, girl. My uncle sent one by line when my family got for credit. You don't want to hear the price of the people they put on or something. But matters worse, me hear say half of the thing they're missing. And me know say a custom. Girl, all you know say are customs. Lisa, stop going like you're not having a sense, man. You know say everybody talk about it in the media. You don't wanna stop listening to hearsay? You ever experience that? Customs don't go into your package, suitcase, barrel or cargo unless you ship the item or the agent stand up right there when they inspect it. Listen, customs job is to protect the borders, collect revenue and to facilitate trade. They don't collect or store shipment, they inspect it and somebody else will present it for inspection. So how customers ever get so much cost in them? Tracey, and the customs alone is involved in the clearance process.
