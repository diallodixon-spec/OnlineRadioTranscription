20251222 211311 Dance, get your fire when the big tune turn on. Summer, push up them lights. Summer, sound the air on. Dollar bill it off, it flink a money, pull up off it one. Make you turn up, turn up that tune, you're just in me. All the pretty girls, they run up, run up, run a bottle of fish again. Summer, take up the microphone full and pick up every clue and pass it. Latch up, no sting, and come sing out the way. When my sound plays, the big tunes light us in the air Your vibes up in the streets And that's just how it feels When reggae music plays Can't help but move your feet up the vibe, cause the music is sweet, yeah. Singing Shaggy, we be killing this beat, yeah. Cause when Saturday night reach, you're nobody nasty.
