20251212 213026 Good morning, gentlemen. Good morning to you all. Let's start with you, Keenan, for your reaction to the suspension of the fiscal rules and the validation provided by the Independent Fiscal Commission. I wouldn't call it an endorsement. It is just merely an independent verification done by the fiscal commissioner in line and in accordance with the legislation. So it's merely procedural. Section three of the FAA Amendment Act says that the fiscal commissioner should validate the estimated fiscal impact. So that's what has been validated to be 1.5% or in this case it is more than 1.5%. So it is effectively automatic once they have determined that the PIOJU's assessment is credible.
