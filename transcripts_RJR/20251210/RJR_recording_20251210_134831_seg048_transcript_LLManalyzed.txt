See you there. This is 94.5. Getting ready for your birthdays and your anniversaries. Make sure you handed me the birthday greetings paper. Give me the paper now. Deflection. Watch him now and give me the paper. Tell him what? Give me the paper. He used it as an excuse for coming here the other day. Just give me the paper, watch him. Happy birthday, eat first and never go out. That's him coming out.
