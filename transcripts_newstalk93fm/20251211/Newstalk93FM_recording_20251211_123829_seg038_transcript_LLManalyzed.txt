============================================================

Oh my, my love I take one look at you, you're taking me out of the ordinary I want you laying me down to the dead and buried On the edge of your knife, staying drunk on your vine The angels up in the clouds, are jealous knowing we've found something so wild From the the ordinary you got me kissing the ground for your sanctuary shatter me when you touch oh lord return me to dust the angels up in the clouds are jealous know what we found hopeless hallelujah hopeless side of heaven's gate Oh, my life, I'll do you. Breathe and take my breath away.
