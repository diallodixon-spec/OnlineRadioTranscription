20251224 183116 It is now 6.31pm. Shout out to Claudette in Central Village. Sorry I wasn't able to play back that song for you Claudette. Time for the break. I write more big tune after the break so continue to keep it locked right here with me. Son Kingston, St. Andrews, St. Catherine, parts of Clarendon, St. Thomas and St. Mary. Tune in to the 104.9 FM or hear us around the world at suncityradio.fm or even via your mobile phone. Which means theoretically, we can't be heard in the White House, Buckingham Palace, halfway up the Eiffel Tower, or backpacking with a cranny in the Amazon. Sun City 104.9 FM. Local coverage. Worldwide listening. Sport more if you're printing this week. Do it
