20260101 181411 I just want you to come and bite it up Just a little winding up Come and meet me behind the truck and we rev it up Whole day, keep throwing it back I know why you stop Baby, no way We could post up all the pictures you want when you're ready. I go over here, darling. You go over there. But we compete in the middle and start a back and all. Play in the middle, hey. What we gonna do now? Jam to a rhythm your company And it's nothing too risky, limited liability
