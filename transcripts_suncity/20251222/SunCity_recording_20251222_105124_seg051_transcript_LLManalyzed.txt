20251222 105124 Christmas is coming, and the goose is getting fat. Drop a penny in the old man's heart, and let me hear you say, Christmas is coming. And the goose is getting fine. Someone say, if you must try, I'll drop a penny in old man's heart. And now don't you take my time, now my Christmas is coming. Someone say now the Christmas is coming. Get the money, bring down the honor, let me take you by the hand and lead you to the land. You're the one for this young Christmas. I'm the lead to hear the angels' voices for night divine.
