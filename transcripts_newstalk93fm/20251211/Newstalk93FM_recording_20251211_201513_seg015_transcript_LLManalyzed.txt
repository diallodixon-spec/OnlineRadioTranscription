I love the way that you bring a vibe With your hands them up in the sky Rollin' back and havin' a time Yeah, real timing again And we havin' money to spend Yes, we jammin' down to the end See me with me cannibal friend Lord, me cannibal friend Where she come from? Where? London Where she come from New York Where she come from When you come in my baby Where she come from Atlanta Where you come from there. New York, I wish you'd come from there. When you come in, my baby. I wish you'd from there. Atlanta, she come from there. Toronto, she come from here. And I know that you miss me. I love the way that you bring a vibe. With your hands, them up in the sky. Falling down and up in a time.
