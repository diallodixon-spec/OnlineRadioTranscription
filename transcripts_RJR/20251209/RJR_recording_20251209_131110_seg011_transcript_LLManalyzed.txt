I don't know where you wanna go But I'm willing to take you there I don't know if a bike or a bicycle But baby, come let me take you somewhere And I don't where know where you wanna go Come with me so much thing to see Where would I be without my mama? Mami, I love you, there's nothing that puts me above you. No host, no girl, no car. Stand firm in all my life, nothing but you. From a barn, me and you a bar. Mami, I'm a princess. Mami, you're my first lady in all my life.
