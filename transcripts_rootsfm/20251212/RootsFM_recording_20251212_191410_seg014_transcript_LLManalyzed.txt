They hold the blade but we hold the handle Somehow, good must conquer evil See you hear me oh lord, I tend to my cry Enough backbite and I hold up on them light I give them father, give them a next life They're under bondage and hold up on them get tight Threw me to fear no man, me turn me into the sky When fabulous, step down ask me why How many morning, how you up and pray? Thank Father God for see a shining day. At one, everybody shout it full rate. Every man want go for them own a way. But who, who know if he drop it? Wally for them a tank but some a false prophet. They hold the plate but we hold the angle.
