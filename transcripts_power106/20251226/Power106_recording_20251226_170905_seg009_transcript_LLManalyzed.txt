20251226 170905 They get the best of me when I am sailing My darling air, all cut up in a reverie Every word is a symphony, won't you believe in me? Sailing, takes me away to where I've always wanted to be It's not far from here to sanity At least not far from me If the wind isn't right we can sail away And find serenity Oh the canvas can do miracles just to wait
