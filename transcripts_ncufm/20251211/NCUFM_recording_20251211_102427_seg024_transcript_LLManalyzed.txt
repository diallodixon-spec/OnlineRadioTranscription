In spite of me Yes, he loves me in spite of me And though sinful my heart, God's love never departs Undeserving I be, his grace still saves me Cause he loves me me in spite of me. Oh, he loves me, yes, he loves me. He loves me in spite of me. Oh, He loves me. My God loves me. He loves me. In spite of me.
