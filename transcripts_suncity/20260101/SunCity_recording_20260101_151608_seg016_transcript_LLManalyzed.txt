20260101 151608 for me like a secret friend. And there's no end while she lives crying. I fumble with a melody or two. Then I'm torn between the things that I should do. Then she to me for all the night or three God, her love is true And she believes in me I'll never know just what she sees in me I told her someday if she was my girl I could change the world with my little songs after all
