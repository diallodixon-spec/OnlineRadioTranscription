20251224 205835 We're taking a nap to the break and coming back at you with much more. Season greetings to you as well and to your family, blessings and a Merry Christmas when it comes. All right, my friend? Yeah, man. It's not so bad, Lloyd. Good to know, brother. Good to know. I know you're further up north, so I think you'll do much, much cooler up in your head. But you know, you you gotta bless up yourself. Easy! And have a Merry Christmas to you and the family. The best of the new year straight around the corner, alright? Easy photo shadow!
