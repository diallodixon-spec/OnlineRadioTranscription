So we know, you know, when the bus come in, you know, and we have to drill it, we have to come out from the square, right? So we look, Mrs. Shees, let me tell you something. Some country driver are the best in the world, You see somebody chucks them, how they load. And I remember when we see one of the trucks pass and it load around two times the height. And we looking at it and hear the sergeant. He grieve because you have to know who is the last person coming off to pack for them something first
