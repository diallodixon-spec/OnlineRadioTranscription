20260102 144627 Today is one year since my father passed. And the anniversary of his passing. And I've been down all morning. I actually got a few felt as if a weight has been lifted off me and I'm feeling much better in myself. Nice. See? Somebody helping us to lift those burdens, to free up the weights.
