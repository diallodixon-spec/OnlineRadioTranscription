20251224 174038 We're putting in three kitchens behind them, little kitchens where they cook, and then we're going to put in, we expect to put in two gazebos where people who buy their products, and those products as you know are fish, bami, curry, goat, and all the other stuff that they sell, their drinks and so on. So we have gone and really fixed it quite quickly. People tell us that you're amazed that they're up so quickly, but it's never quick enough if you don't have your shop. So we're there. Who are benefiting? We have at least 60 families that are involved in the vending at that venue. We have 26 fishermen who support them. We have a bunch of farmers that produce the vegetables and stuff that they put in the cooking yam and whatever else they cook.
