20251215 192115 is now a serious concern in my community. It's been exactly seven weeks since the garbage was collected. In other communities, it's been even longer. I don't get why it seems like nothing is being done to address this issue. Mr. Audley Gordon, we need your intervention. All right. We haven't spoken to Solid Waste for a couple of weeks, so let's put in a request for Mr. Gordon to give us an update all right camille listen asking for an update on garbage collection in saint james saying it's been seven weeks in her community listen if you're still there tell me which community let me go to our phone lines now we have simon online in kingston simon what's on your mind? Yes, sir, what's up? Yes, a few things, but maybe I'll cut them down. Now, my experience, I asked the doctor today, and I may not get fully there, but I'm fine, I'll get a grip on it.
