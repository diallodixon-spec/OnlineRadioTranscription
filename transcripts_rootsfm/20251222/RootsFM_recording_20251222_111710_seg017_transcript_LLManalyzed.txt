20251222 111710 heard on Roots 96.1 FM. I'm your host, Dr. Stephanie Mullings, pharmacist, educator, and entrepreneur. And we're listening today to Dr. Lisa Shaw. And we're talking about her journey as an educator, as a mother, as a person who is involved in church, how did she navigate her journey as she studied and completed her doctorate degree? I wanted to just share with the listening audience, Dr. Faisi Shaw, one lesson from your PhD journey that particularly transformed your approach to work-life balance. Dr. Mullins, I think for us, that is meant time. Finding time really is one of the biggest challenges.
