and they may have interacted with people who have had bad experiences with a mammogram or a pap smear. I've heard it all in my office. Doc, I've never done a mammogram, but here I say it's hot. Doc, I have never done a pap smear, here I say it is hot. And they go in believing that the whole process and procedure will be hard. So they have a negative stigma attached to it. So they're expecting the worse. So my advice is just to be calm, just to be chill, just relax, listen to your doctor. Most doctors have their own technique for guiding you throughout the mammogram, guiding you throughout the pap smear, and all will be well, you know, all will be well. And once you pass that first hurdle, any other mammogram, any other pap smear after that would be pretty straightforward. All right, we're going to take break. Yeah, I tell people some of the time, some of the people will never ever do it too. And them I tell you, say it's hot. And if you say, really, when did you do it? They never did. So guys, just go experience it for yourself. Trust me, we're going to take a break. Doc, thank you so
