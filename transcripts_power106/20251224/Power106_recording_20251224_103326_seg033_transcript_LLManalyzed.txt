20251224 103326 Dejaune Whisper-Richards at World Cup Football Qualifier vs Bermuda. He came off the bench and turned the game on its head. Dejaune Whispers-Richards dances through the defence and buries it. The goal by Ronaldo Cifas at World Cup Qualifier vs Trinidad and Tobago. Blink and you'll miss him. Ronaldo Cifas turns on the jets, leaves the defence in the dust and fires Jamaica one step closer to the World Cup. Horse racing. I dream again winning the Jamaica Derby. On Independence Day, a dream comes true at Caymanas Park. I dream again roars down the home stretch to capture the derby in a finish that will be talked about for years.
