20251215 163716 Oh, baby, I don't know my lady I don't know si baby, yeah Sometimes I wonder, I never make it to Into this world with a half a knew I just don't have a clue And sometimes it seems like this world's closing ahead of me And there's no way of breaking free And then I see you reach for me Sometimes Sometimes I want to give up, I want to give in, I want to quit the fight, and then I see you, baby. And everything's all right, and everything's all right. When I see you smile, I can face the world. Oh, you know I can do anything. When I see your smile, I see the rings of life. Oh, I see you shining right through the way now.
