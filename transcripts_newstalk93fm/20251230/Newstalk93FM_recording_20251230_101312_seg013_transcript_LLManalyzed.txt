20251230 101312 You're listening to Sleek Radio, 93 FM. I have a lightning spirit Early in the morning I had it Me cooler ready, me ice done ready Me punching that's automatic I have a lightning jumbie A kind of energy inside me And it ready for the rum Ready, ready for the rum Ready ready for the rum ready for the action A spiritual encounter Killing me soul taking over Telling me to start up the drinking Can't do away with good behaviour So we out on the road now BOOM! It's Mars and Riddy Man Soaker
