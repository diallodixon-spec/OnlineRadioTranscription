20251223 122120 I'm a freaking dynamite. I blow your condo light. You know I'm just that type. No, them nothing kill my vibe. Them nothing kill my vibe, them nothing kill you, them nothing kill, them nothing kill me. Wise man said, follow the stars. There you shall find a piece of advice. If you hit your enemies, enemies shine. If you're not a friend of me, enter the light. Cause you can never kill my vibe. Go out there with no sacrifices. Everything was taken, still had to make it. Vibe killer, me and you go take a vibe killer. Somebody come, protect my energy from your bad aura. Let my pastor say, I be my healer. Everything I desire, I go deceive. My rhythm, flow like a river. If you get your work, come on, go and sit down. I go just para, come out my jigger. I go just play, follow my lead. I'm feeling vibes on vibes. I'm taking dynamite. I blow your condolences.
