20251217 161110 Been around some names But the key goes to the same Some things never change Here's a tip, show me your friends I'll show you your future, keep the change Saturday morning, jumped out of bed Put on my best suit Got in my car, raced like a jet All the way to a loop Knocked on your door with heart in my hand To ask you a question Cause I know that you're an old fashioned man Can I have your daughter for the rest of my life? Say yes, say yes, cause I need to know You say I'll never get your blessing till the day I die So I've loved my friend but the answer is no Why you gotta be so rude? Don't you know I'm human too?
