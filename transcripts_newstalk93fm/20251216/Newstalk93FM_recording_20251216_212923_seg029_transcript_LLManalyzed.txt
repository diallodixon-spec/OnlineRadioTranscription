20251216 212923 my cry and if I ever let you down my friend it was a misunderstanding so if I took it for granted then I promise from today I'll go jump like I never jump waved like I never waved fine like I never wanted to just to show you I saw you, I saw you and I need you back in my life. You got people by the truck. Emotions running high. We underpin the sky. Tears running down we lie. Can't you tell that we sorry? We sorry. And we need you back in we lie. I need you back, come on to me. Come on to me. I, I, it's time to face the truth. Come to me, come to me.
