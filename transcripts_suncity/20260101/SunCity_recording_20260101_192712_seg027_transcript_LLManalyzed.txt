20260101 192712 I'm standing right here in the midst of my sin. Lord, I beg you to be the Lamb of God. Holy, thank you for the Lamb. Thank you for the Lamb of God, the precious Lamb of God. You are the Lamb of God because of you. It's so sweet, baby. Even when I broke apart Mostly in sorrows and pain But I'm standing right here In the midst of my tears I claim you'll be forever gone
