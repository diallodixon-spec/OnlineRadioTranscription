Why don't you give love on Christmas day? Christmas day The man on the street and the couple upstairs Still needs to know there's someone who cares Give love on Christmas day Christmas day No greater gift is there than a What the world needs is love Yes, the world needs your love Why don't you give love on Christmas Day? Every little child on Santa's knee Has room for your love underneath the tree Give love on Christmas day No greater gift is there than love Give love on Christmas
