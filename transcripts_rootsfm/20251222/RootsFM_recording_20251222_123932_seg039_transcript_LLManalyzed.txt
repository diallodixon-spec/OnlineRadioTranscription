Commanding Officer of the Newport West Police Formation, Superintendent Rochelle MacGibson Scott, says criminals have been using social media platforms to advertise high-value vehicles at prices far below their true market worth. She explained that videos of vehicles are often filmed near the Wharf and promoted online to create the impression of legitimacy. Superintendent McGibbon Scott warned that scammers typically pressure potential buyers to act quickly, requesting deposits or online payments without proper verification.
