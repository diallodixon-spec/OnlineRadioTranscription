20251223 142116 I just woke up from a dream But you and I had to say goodbye And I don't know what it all means But since I survived, I realized Wherever you go, that's where I'll follow Nobody's promised tomorrow So I'ma love you every night like it's the last night Like it's the next night If the world was ending, I'd wanna be next to you If the party was over and our time on earth was through I wanna hold you just for a while and dive with the flow
