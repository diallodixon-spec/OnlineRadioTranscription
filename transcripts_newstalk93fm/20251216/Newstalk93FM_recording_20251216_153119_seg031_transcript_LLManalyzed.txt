20251216 153119 People might be offended But it's actually sweet All the time you've spent on me It's honestly wild All the effort you've put in It's actually romantic I really gotta hand it to you No man has ever loved me like you do I hadn't thought of you in a long time But you keep sending me funny valentines And I know you think it comes off vicious But it's precious, adorable Like a toy chihuahua bucking at me From a tiny purse, that's how much it hurts How many times has your boyfriend said Why are we always talking about hurt? It's actually sweet All the time you've spent on me
