============================================================

I see you in a different light You are the one I I'd always turn to The one I could talk to, baby The one I could trust Who would ever dream We would be here together Making love The sweetest surprise that you were here beside me. I see you in a different light. You can't provide moonlight. I see you when it's different weather, through different nights, through different songs.
