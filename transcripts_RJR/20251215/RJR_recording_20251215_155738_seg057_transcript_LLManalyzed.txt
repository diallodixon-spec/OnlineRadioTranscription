20251215 155738 Thank you very much for those reassuring words. Sheena Lynn Hansen, ladies and gentlemen, she has three books out for sure, perhaps working on another because she never stops the crown and the cross. We also have no escape and red flags She's clearly an avid writer. Tell us where can we get these books where they're located? She miss miss Hanson Well for now they are on Amazon all of them are on Amazon So if you want to purchase just go onto Amazon type it in and that's where they can get them and of course they are just different issues the crown and the cross really is a personal story a testament from you no escape embracing the cross you say the crown and becoming heaven's original desire
