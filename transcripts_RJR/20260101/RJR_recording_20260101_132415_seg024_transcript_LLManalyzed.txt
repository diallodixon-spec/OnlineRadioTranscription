20260101 132415 Lord, you have said thy glory above the heavens, and out of the mouth of babes and suckling has the ordained strength because of thine enemies. We thank you, Lord, for a new day. We want to tell you thank you Lord for having taken us through 2025, a rough and challenging year it was for many of us, and some of us are still reeling from the issues and the effects of the many happenings, mishaps of last year. But on the threshold of this new year, the first day of this 2026 year, we want to tell you thank you for your grace, you for your mercy thank you for your kindness and learn from the authority of your words that you've instructed us that were three five and six that says trust in the Lord with our heart lead not to thine own understanding in all our ways we should acknowledge you
