20251217 194923 So I won't make a list and send it To the North Pole for Saint Ex I won't even stay awake to Hear those magic reindeer's cry I just want you here tonight Holding on to me so tight What more can I do? All I want for Christmas is you You, baby All the lights are shining so brightly everywhere And the sound of children's laughter fills the air And everyone is singing I hear those candles ringing Santa won't you bring me the one I really need Won't you please bring my baby to me I don't want a lot for Christmas
