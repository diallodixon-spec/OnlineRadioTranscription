Dr. Taylor, the office of the DPP is an office with integrity. The other one is the opposite. Okay. I heard you. All right. Good. Good morning, Dr. Taylor. After Melissa, I brought back a few things and put in the refrigerator. And the light went out from 5 p.m. Until now, I made a report and nothing. I live on the border of St. Catherine and Clarendon. Please see what you can do for us. Thank you. You're the voice of the voiceless. Ah, sometimes, yeah, I get you. Let's see, though. I, border of St. Catharine and Clarence, so that'll be like a free-town area yeah okay all right let me see Jaja we hope we work this one a good morning
