20251215 091609 cancer. So in 2022, we had an estimated 1599 cases. And that was those were new cases. And we had an estimated 829 deaths from prostate cancer in 2022. So it is so important for us in Jamaica and in the Caribbean to talk about prostate cancer, because it is our number one cancer. So of course, as you asked, when we're talking about it, we have to look at the main risk factors. Yeah. So when we look at risk factors for cancers, we talk about the things that we can change, and those are modifiable risk factors. And then we talk about things that we cannot change. And those are our non-modifiable risk factors. So interestingly, the non-modifiable factors, things that we cannot change, are more likely to be associated with prostate cancer. So we're looking at age. So your risk for prostate cancer for men increases after 40, but especially after 50.
