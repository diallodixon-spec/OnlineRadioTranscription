20251226 093730 I can say for certain that it's true There's a chance for me and you I sure feel like the time is near The picture in my mind is weary clean I think love has brought us here I remember not too long ago I was just a lonely person With a lonely heart Yeah And I was hoping there could one day be a chance For me to get the love that I've been missing Sometimes love takes a long time
