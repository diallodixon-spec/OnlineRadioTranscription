20251225 215425 I don't wanna hurt my pillow late at night no more I'm tossing and turning and think about burning down these walls I don't wanna feel this fire no more no more no more See I made up my mind cause I'm wasting my time Ain't nothing here to keep me warm Over and over I try And over and over you lie And over and over I cry Over and over, over and over I try Rain on me Lord, won't you take it? Pain from me
