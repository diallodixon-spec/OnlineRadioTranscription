to qualify 14 games we play all with jamaican local players but i brought three of them in the last six games we play against el salvador was one zero by i think andy andy williams uh we play one0 to Costa Rica, 1-0 to El Salvador, Costa Rica, and Canada. And we tied with, in the US, 1-1, John Burton. And tied 2-2, El Salvador there, with Paul Howard and John Burton. And you tied 0-0 with Mexico. I think that was the most fascinating thing for me, the facility.
