20260101 092624 And it flows through you and it flows through me And I love you so much more Than my love I can see beyond forever Everything we are will never die Love is such a beautiful thing Oh, you make my world a summer day I'm just a dream to fade away Never mind, it's too much Never, never mind, it's much harder to come back I'm waiting in line Nobody gets too much loving love It's as high as a mountain
