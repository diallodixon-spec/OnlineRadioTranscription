20251219 180605 I love my culture and love where we from We get these powers from the same nation Sweet like steel drum this with these vibrations Don't let the rhythm get you just run run run run Even you could handle it your man But like when the mat will hide We gon' rip it up a spine Good vibes and party we lovin' Sweet woman, we have it, greatest on the planet, boy. Somebody radio loud playin' a song and it goes and I fuck, and if I lose myself inside this place, well, I show my shit up.
