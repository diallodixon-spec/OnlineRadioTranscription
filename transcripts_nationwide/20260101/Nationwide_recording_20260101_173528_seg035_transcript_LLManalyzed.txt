I just wanna love you baby Always thinking of you baby See I don't know if I can handle you as just a friend Oh baby I can't pretend Oh baby I'm so far away But I don't mind as long as I could have you in my life Oh baby, I'm satisfied real Wasting your life, I'll take you to paradise If you want it baby, just be real
