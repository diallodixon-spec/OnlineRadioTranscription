Come together we feel we build stronger Helping hands to me brother and sister Wanna not be each other's keeper Call upon a friend, local or abroad In these desperate times it's so hard But I know that we will rise We are the life of the Caribbean And that's right, yeah Even when the skies are gray Hope still fights our way As this song comes back again Over mountains, over plains Every heart will heal again
