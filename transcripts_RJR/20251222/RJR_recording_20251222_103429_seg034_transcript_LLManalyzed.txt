20251222 103429 I call this radio station to my Weibo, I chuck. Till the Christmas, I chuck. I live off, you know. Pay me taxes, do everything. No one seems to care and help me with water commission in this country. No one. And you know, so the storm, you know, people. I chuck here and move, you know't get the truck out. Can't truck don't sink down under the road. No man, the truck doesn't sink, they come there and use it, they escape, get to the trench, seven miles out of the road, into the meagre. So now this, a mead has pulled it out all along, you know, and I see me scabber it all over the place.
