20251212 181508 Amen. Jesus Christ our Lord, who remained steadfast in trials, who wore the victory over death and the grave, who is alive forevermore. Serenaders, let us hold fast to the faith of Christ. Indeed, let us have the faith of Jesus. As he overcame, so can we and so shall we. Please stay tuned to Sunset Serenade on NCUFM. Sometimes life seems like words and music That can't quite become a song
