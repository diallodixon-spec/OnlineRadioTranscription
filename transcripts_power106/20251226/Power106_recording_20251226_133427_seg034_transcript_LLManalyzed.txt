20251226 133427 I'm all alone, still you go. I was telling a lie. Are you satisfied? No one's with me tonight. Only Jah, and he's always by my side. Pretty little woman, don't you trust me no more. You't have to break down my door I'm all alone Come inside and you will see There's no one here but me Told you I'd soon be over Still you refuse to believe Are you satisfied? White blood tears from your eyes I'm all alone, still you know I was telling a lie Are you satisfied? No one made me to die
