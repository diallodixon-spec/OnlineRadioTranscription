20251223 141111 With me Every time I'm alone with you You keep talking about you loving me Baby Your foreplay just blows my mind So why don't we stop all the talking, girl Why don't we stop wasting time? I've had my share of love But some say I'm damn good And if you think you can turn me out Baby I wish that you would Cause you keep telling me this And telling me that You say once I'm with you I'll never go back You say there's a lesson you wanna teach Well here I am baby, practice what you do
