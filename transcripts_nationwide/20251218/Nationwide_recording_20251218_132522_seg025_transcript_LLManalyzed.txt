20251218 132522 Pretty little baby, I'm so in love with you Not just too good to be true Can't take my eyes off of you You be lying, heavy talk I wanna hold you tight At long last, love hasn't died I thank God I'm alive You you're just too good to be true Can't take my eyes off of you Hardly anybody's there, there's nothing else to compare The smile on your face
