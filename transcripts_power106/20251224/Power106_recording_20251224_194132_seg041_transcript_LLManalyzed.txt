20251224 194132 and inexperienced rider will be in the back. KV Choice will be prominent, drawn more towards the stand side. But no question of opposing number seven, Dustin Bigtime. 60 Ben restricted allowance, five here. And looking at this race, I think that Captain Fantastic has to be given a good chance here. And I would love to see Captain Fantastic, or number two in my apartment, win this. Why? Because that gentleman trainer, I call him Michael Marlow, second generation man of course, is on 99 career winners. So Pachi will be about Captain Fantastic who is well rated in this race over the straight course and should give a good account of his own out of himself. All right number two, three, speed on wheels will run well enough to make the frame. So too, no real manner expected also. Now that's number five, to be around at the finish, especially with the great Dave, Dave, yeah, said for loving Nelson in his back.
