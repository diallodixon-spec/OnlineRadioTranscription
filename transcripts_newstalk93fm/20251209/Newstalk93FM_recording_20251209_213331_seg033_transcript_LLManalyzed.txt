You play the more that you pay You're softer than a kitten so you don't know the life of a showgirl, babe And you're never gonna wanna I took her pearls of wisdom, hung them from my neck I paid my dues with every bruise I knew what to expect Do you wanna take a skate on the ice inside my veins? They ripped me off like false lashes and then threw me away And all the headshots on the walls of the dance hall are of the witches who wish I'd hurry up and die. But I'm immortal now, baby dolls. I couldn't if I tried. So I say, thank you for the lovely book. Hey, I'm married to the hustle and now I know the life of a showgirl, babe. And I'll never know another. Hey, hidden by the lipstick.
