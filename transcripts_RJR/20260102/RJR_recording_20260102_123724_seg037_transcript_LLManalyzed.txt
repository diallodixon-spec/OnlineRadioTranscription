20260102 123724 is to stop being mendacious. André, lies will not stop as this has been going on from creation, but at least let us try to be truthful to each other. And this goes for the ordinary man to the politician. Have a blessed day, André, from Carmen in Gregory Park. Thank you, Carmen. And Clark E. Bliss from Hunstown in St. Mary says, Good day, Mr. Earl. Wish you and your listeners a Happy New Year. I feel for the mother of that four-year-old child that was alleged to be shot by members of the security forces. Time come for the government to make it mandatory for members of the security force to wear body cameras. That call is growing louder. Blessings and Happy New Year Mr. Earl. I'm a part of the church but I don't understand why
