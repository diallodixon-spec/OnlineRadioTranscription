20251225 135526 I don't know what it all means But since I survived, I realized Wherever you go, that's where I'll follow Nobody's promised tomorrow So I'ma love you every night like it's the last night Like it's last night If the world was ending, I wanna be next to you If the party was over and our time on earth was through I wanna hold you just for a while And time with a smile If the world was ending I'd wanna be next to you
