20251218 181814 Blowers became the longest-priced winner in UK racing history when he took the opener triumphed at Kelso in November 1990 at 250-1. The feat has been achieved twice in Ireland, most recently in April 2022 and also in 2020. Trained by Nigel Hawke and written by James Best, the five-year-old is named after retired cricket commentator Henry Blofeld and had only run twice previously. Best says he got the ride by chance.
