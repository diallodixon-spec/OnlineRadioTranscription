20251212 175544 9 3 saying we should not let go of this story uh until answers are received absolutely brick road is also saying to us great questions but i'm not surprised we don't care is is what's really happening in this in this country the the glasgow family should receive answers we're trying for the parents to see if they heard anything between last evening when the mother was interviewed and today and we weren't able to get through to the parents. We've been trying for the NPTA president Stuart Jacobs and we haven't been able to um get through to him. He did commit to come on and share his perspectives on this matter. Where is the education ministry? Where is the opposition spokesperson on education? One would think that everybody would be sounding the alarm on a matter like this.
