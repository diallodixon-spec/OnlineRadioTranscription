20251215 142613 It's a Christmas time, Christmas time Oh, when we hear them say But oh, what fun it is to ride On a New York City subway Splashing through the snow With a pretty young girl I know On and on we go That's how our love will grow Hear Hear the music play. Listen every word they say. Oh, A-I-I-I. I said, yeah. It's the King of Israel. This is an antique moment.
