My suffering is real I'm a storyteller No time, I go days without mail My mother is no bank teller Rat can't do without cheese Man can't do without cheddar They don't know you when you're broke But when you're up, hear them Yo, brother Long time I not suffer but things take time Time, time, time, time Eyes on the money for me live it on my mind Mine, mine, mine, mine It mess up, see you work so hard And they don't want see you shine, see you shine But me have me guts up for me not your mine Mine, mine, mine Wanting me to rest brief on my TV Which are the most let me erase it, yeah And me not say no more
