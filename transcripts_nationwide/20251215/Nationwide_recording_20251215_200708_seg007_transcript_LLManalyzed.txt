20251215 200708 We shall overcome, cause they shall be done From the east to the west we say peace and love We don't stop, we can't stop Them sell we guns, sell we lies, sell we promises And kill we say all we friends and we enemies And many men sell out them family for all pennies man The bigger heads a lie through them teeth I see them building the system that's sinking With them Ph.D. brains I'll be thinking A lot for the rich, a lot for the poor Who need not go get but they greedy get more Bring the alarm Another you just die They took him out like fly But they pulled on the pavement with tears in his eyes And we cry, we cry. Politicians lying, soldiers on front line. Don't start the war, don't fight the war. What you're losing will light the fire. Shine on Jamaica.
