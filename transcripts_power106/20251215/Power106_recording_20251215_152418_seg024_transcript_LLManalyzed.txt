Stop stealing, moving the boundaries, because the surveyor can't come and know exactly where it used to go. And because that one is giving you trouble, put up a boundary fence. You might not be able to put up a block and seal, but put up even a block and seal foundation, if you can, and then start, you know, maybe packing stones like what the old people used to do or maybe put barbed wire but get a proper foundation and protect that part of it but i'm going to send you a little later on all the information i would need from you and i love the old diagrams as well to see copies of them to help you to establish your ownership right but it's very important yes yes yes we have a call online is wrong hello thank you so much yes yes yeah
