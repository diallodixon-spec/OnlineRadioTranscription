20260102 163227 I'm feeling vibes on vibes. I'm taking dynamite. I blow your candlelight. You know I'm just that type. No, I'm not thinking you my vibe. I'm not thinking my vibe. You're not thinking you, you're not thinking you. You don't know what to do. I don't have a choice. I don't want to die. I don't care what happens to me. I just want to live. I want to be alive. I want to die.
