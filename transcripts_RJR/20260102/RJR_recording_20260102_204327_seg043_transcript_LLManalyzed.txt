20260102 204327 Girls I need My girl is leaving while I'm breathing Just can't live without ya But I will keep on hanging cause I'm not giving up I'll be fighting for ya Can't believe it that you're leaving Can't you see that I am grieving One mistake should break us apart Baby please don't crush my heart When a time a girl encountered a prince And she kept waiting for him ever since She told him for her there would never be another Can you remember? Oh, she waited and waited, patiently anticipating his return A heart would love story. A part with you and a lot with Bernie. But she never gave up hope. That's how I think about you and me. Just like Peaches and Herb. Like Romeo and Juliet. Like a uber truck.
