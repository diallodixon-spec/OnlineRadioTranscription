2025-12-12 05:41:46 It was just a dream Haunting me once again The dream of simple fantasy That I wished was reality That you come knocking at my door And we relive this dream once more The day you left, you said you would return just when you wouldn't browse. Said you needed time alone. You said you loved me and someday our love could be.
