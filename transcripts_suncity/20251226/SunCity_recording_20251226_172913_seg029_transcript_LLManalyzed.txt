20251226 172913 So here's the field. Salute the Don. Eight furlongs the journey. Salute that Don is the favorite even money. Number two. Midnight traveler. 63 to 1. Number three. I actually just, I don't have my race book with me. It's sold out. So I wrote down the names of the horses. Number three is Don Spirit. London Spirit. There we go. Number four is We Jam in at six to one. London Spirit is at seven to one. I can't even recognize my own writing. We Jam in number four is at six to one, number five Tia Maria is at five to one, number six God's Plan, 12 to one. Number seven, Fernando, four to 1. Number 8, Senor Biscotti is at 18. Number 9 is Big boss at 22 to 1. Number 10, Prosperity Sen is at 77 to 1. I don't think that one will hit the board.
