20251215 153617 Vision 2030 Jamaica. Take away yourself from trouble, take away yourself from trouble. Take away, take away, yourself from trouble. Nothing, no sweet life, the gift of life. Walk away from trouble, stay away from strife. Life is to live through the best in life. You only live once, you'll not live twice, yo. Follow the road on the righteous path, still focus and conscious, put your in your tartar, say. Don't make the wicked, them corrupt your heart. Do the right thing, become the work, yes or yes or? Take away yourself from truth.
