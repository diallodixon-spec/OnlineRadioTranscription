============================================================

communities, strengthen families, and inspire Christlike love across Jamaica. To experience his light is more than just a phrase. It is an invitation. It is a call to let his love illuminate our daily lives, to let his compassion guide our choices, and to let his example inspire us to serve one another. When we choose to serve, even in small and simple ways, we help his light to shine more brightly in our hearts, our homes, our neighborhoods, and our nation. This afternoon afternoon we are gathered here not only to introduce this year's initiative but to affirm that the light of our savor is meant to be shared. Your participation enables this message to extend beyond
