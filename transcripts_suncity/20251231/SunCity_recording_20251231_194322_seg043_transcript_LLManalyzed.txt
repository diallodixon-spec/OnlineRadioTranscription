20251231 194322 Forever, come on and sing my song Ride it out All night, oh Hold on tight All night, yeah Keep the faith All night, oh Till morning light All night, all night, yeah Once Once we get started, we won't back down. We're island strong. We'll turn this around. Everyone's singing their troubles away. Jamaica's still standing brighter each day. Come on, come on. Everybody jump in the beat, baby. Come on. Come on. Who is Jerald from South Carolina? Always looking!
