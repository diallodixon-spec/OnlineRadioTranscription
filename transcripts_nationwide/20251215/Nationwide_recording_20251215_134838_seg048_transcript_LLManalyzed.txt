20251215 134838 Joint Select Committee would have been dissolved when Parliament would have been dissolved and we would know how that dedicated ministry is now a part of the Ministry of Justice. So I'm a little bit disappointed with the traction that was made in the constitutional reform process for the year. Yeah, I'm a little bit disappointed with that. I had hoped that following the election, we would have seen an increased priority on the matter. But then, of course, we had a national emergency that would have taken our focus away from it again. So I think my overall feeling for the year as it relates to constitutional reform is disappointment, unfortunately. But for next year, I'm hoping that we can again make it a priority.
