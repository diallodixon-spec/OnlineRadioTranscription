20251217 122921 Graham Powell says their experience contributed to the win. The game started out well and we were leading and then the rains came and it put a damper on the spirit of the girls but we are true fighters we believe we know that you know nothing is going to come easy so we had to just rally back we had to move from the stadium down to Walmers and you know it wasn't an easy feat but we knew that we could do it we are defending champions we have many titles under our belt so stuff like these are stuff that we have gone through so you know the rain coming is not something that you know we are not accustomed to we have had it before and we had to regroup so the the girls came back, they were a bit down, but as I kept on saying, we have put in the work and it's the work that we have been doing that came and helped us to get this victory and we are giving God's thanks.
