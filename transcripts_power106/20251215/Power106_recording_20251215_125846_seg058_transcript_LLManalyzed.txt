20251215 125846 go into tracing back to where or who this person got this bogus license from. They're not bogus, I'm telling you. The corruption is better than you think. Then this corrupt person who issued this license along with his so-called driver should be dealt with as harshly as possible. Absent this approach, the corruption will continue, and these illiterate roadhogs, they're not illiterate, will continue to kill off Jamaicans. They're not illiterates. This won't happen in Jamaica, though Jamaica is just a free-for-all, headless, lawless, cha-ka-cha-ka country. Yeah, but you get it wrong. Nothing is wrong with the license they have. It's not bogus. There's nothing to look on it and see that this one is bogus because it's a genuine license. And secondly, the people who are giving trouble on the road are not illiterate. We know this as a fact. Alright, place is just indiscipline.
