20251231 200103 What doesn't kill you makes you stronger, stronger Just me, myself and I What doesn't kill makes you stronger Stand a little taller Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone You heard that I was starting over with someone new They told you I wasn't moving on over you And think that I'd come back, I'd come back swinging You tried to break me but you see what doesn't kill you Makes you stronger, stand a little taller
