20251231 182215 I can put my guard down. I can put my heart up. Unplug the alarm now. Show you on my car now. I don't need a rich bitch to somebody that can make me feel safe. Yeah. Look, I don't want a couple, but nobody ever made me feel safe like you. Because when I'm with you, I just know I'm fine. You take all the pressure off my mind all the time. Patient in time will not be going out my mind. Say from the problems, I don't worry because I'm hard to find. Safe like I just ran and slid across the plate Safe like we playing tag and you home base Safe like I got a big dog and a gate Safe like you one of these play in my face Yeah, you know I know you know that I'm that bitch, right? You gotta go
