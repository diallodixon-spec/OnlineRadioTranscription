But why should a child, and you said it before, I think you said they don't have the I think you said mental capacity to give consent and fine. So they're engaging in these practices and they're harmful practices. Why would you want to further burden them having made a mistake with a legal consequence as opposed to what I hear Jade saying, which is give them other forms of support. Well, we're saying that our point is that we believe that if you move that stop sign, things are going to deteriorate further and the society, the children are going to be moving further in the wrong direction. So we believe it is a deterrent that should remain. But has that deterrent worked though, Nigel Cooper? Has it been successful? Is there any evidence, and I stand to be guided by both of you, is there any evidence that having deterrent, as you call it, in place now has stopped children from engaging in this conduct?
