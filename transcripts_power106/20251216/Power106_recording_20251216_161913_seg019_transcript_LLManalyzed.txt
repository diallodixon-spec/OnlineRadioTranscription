20251216 161913 This message on WhatsApp is quite interesting. Good afternoon, Jesse. I'm listening to your program, but it's so hard to hear the opinions of some of your callers. If Jamaica was not respected around the world, they would not get such a response. They should take a look at what is going on around the world. God bless Jamaica. I asked a question. I'm trying to understand your correspondence better. It's hard to hear the opinion of some of the callers. What is it? Is that they're not being articulated convincingly? Or they're not being articulated in a way that is understandable by you. The opinions aren't clear and concise enough. What is it? I'd love to know. I'd love to some more where that is concerned. So if you could respond.
