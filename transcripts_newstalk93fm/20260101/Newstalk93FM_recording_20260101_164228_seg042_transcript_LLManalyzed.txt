20260101 164228 I'm telling me'm the one. Which kind of money we never see before Could sell on me cause me feeling like me one Ajay, ajay, ajay Can never take my cake away Ajay, you can count my grace I just say my lane, my lane Me no get the time for the hate and the bad energy Cause my mind on my money Make you dance like me
