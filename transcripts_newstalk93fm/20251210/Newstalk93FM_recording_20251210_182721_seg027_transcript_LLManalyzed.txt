============================================================

I don't know what to do so I bleedin' Plus you ain't givin' me no reason You tell me this the end of we season Mash up we think just just so You don't understand when you watch me You just think that I will be not cheap How you gonna pick up just so And then dump me? No, baby, no But you're back on me closing a garbage bag You put it on the ground by the roadside You tell me get out your place, don't come inside Baby don't do me that, you're gonna break me heart Can't believe you're ready to give up on me just so me rewind that one long time. Long, long time, long, long, long time. So how long have see her? Give me her wine. Give me, give, give, give me her wine. All of me make up for all this time. I'll pick up from all this time. What's up? Hey, hey, look who in the house.
