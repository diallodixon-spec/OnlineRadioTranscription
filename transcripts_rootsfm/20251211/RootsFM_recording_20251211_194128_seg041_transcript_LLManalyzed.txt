2025-12-12 06:15:54 I will be your father, with your tiny hand in mine I will be your preacher, give you anything you have in mind I will be your Father, if I have had enough of love I will be the one who loves you, till the end of time That's all I wanted But sometimes love can be a-stickin' For a crime, that's all I wanted Just to see my baby's blue eyes shine This time I'll take that motherly love
