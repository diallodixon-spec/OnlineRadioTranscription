20251230 115539 but is correct with these things. So for example, in recent times, last week, the whole of last week, it's all about the BOJ, because what the governor say, yo, the fact that them money not spend the capital budget over the years is a big problem, because it weaken the economy and slow down the economy. Same things that we have been saying. Next thing he must say is that, boy, I'm not so confident about them money ability to spend the money we are bringing you know because when we look at history and see the under spending of the capital budget I wonder if the same thing is going to happen yep next thing he must say because their focus is on paying down the debt yes obviously next thing must say is that the longer the money they take to start spending the money and rehabilitate the economy, the more I'm going to be under pressure to contain inflation. To keep plugging? Precisely. So I still have to keep rates high and all of those things, which help to contract the economy rather than expand the economy. So I want them to start doing what they want to do, so that means I have to hold on.
