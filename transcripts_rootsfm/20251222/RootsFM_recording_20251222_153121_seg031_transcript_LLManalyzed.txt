20251222 153121 We call it love When you want it the most There's no easy way out When you're ready to go And your heart's left in doubt Don't give up on your faith Love comes to those who believe it And that's the way it is That's the way it oh yeah When you question me Or the simple answer I don't know what to say No, but it's plain to see If you stick together You're gonna find a way So don't surrender
