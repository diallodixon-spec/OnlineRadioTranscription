20251223 105222 Sometimes I feel scared. I wanna call you don't know if you are still here father, please I won't be released Can you hear me? I know I falter but I'm still your daughter I in the of my life, you were the offer Look at all the blessings you give me You've made me ungrateful, forgive me But I beat me up And when they put me down, just lift me up Then you do it one more time Break all the chains when they hold me by Hear my cry, hear my cry Stand up and know the real me and I'm a bear Things may cut you high
