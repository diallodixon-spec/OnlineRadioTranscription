Oh, through the day and night. Oh, you like it, baby. Hope we never get tired. And I never have to go to work. No one, I mean, I'm a dog. Misrespecting the notice that's inside. No, baby, no, baby, daddy, n, dry matter No heart in no way Just the whisper of a voice till all day long You and me, baby, hope we never get tired Hope we never get tired now
