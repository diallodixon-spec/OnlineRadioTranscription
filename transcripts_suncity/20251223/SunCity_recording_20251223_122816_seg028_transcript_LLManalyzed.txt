20251223 122816 I just want to know Now who's in your head, in your head I want to know who's in your, in your head You move like danger But I don't mind The way in your bed Wrapped in your arms while I ain't sleeping. Got lost in your halo, halo. I just wanna know. Now who's in your head, in your head? Giving out the moment, keeping me in the moment.
