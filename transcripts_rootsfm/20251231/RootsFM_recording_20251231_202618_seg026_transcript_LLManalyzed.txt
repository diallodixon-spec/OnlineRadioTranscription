20251231 202618 Just keep me warm in your love When you're softly near Then it's me you need to show How deep is your love How deep is your deep How deep it means to love Cause we're living in a world of rules Breaking us down When they all shall let us be We belong to you and me I believe in you You know the door to a better song You're the light in my deepest darkest cloud You're my savior when I fall And you may not think that I care for you When you know down inside that I really do
