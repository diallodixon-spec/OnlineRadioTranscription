With that flick on your brother, you feeling some way, make them act like I'm dick up a dick up a send a hit, we get actin'. Mention why I been playin' with the game in the padlock. Yeah, got that hair up in the waist, pretty face, it's platinum. Thank you, got every shot. I can help from the back till we pass out. I could angle that ho, put a leg in that ankle lock, hold that pussy, tap out. Be one deep on your street with that strap. One D, a rapper, let's see what that rap got. I got a brand new pistol. I'ma make it just like, like Craig in the 80's Baby D, baby D, niggas ain't crazy Broke that scap, go straight to my baby And I make my b**ch talk to moon b**ch, talk bad Big rocks on my wrist, I bust it big Glock on my hip, I clutch it Let's go, get lost so the b**ch ain't nut Make check one two, check one, stretch two When it come to murder, you know how we do When I walk in these b**ches
