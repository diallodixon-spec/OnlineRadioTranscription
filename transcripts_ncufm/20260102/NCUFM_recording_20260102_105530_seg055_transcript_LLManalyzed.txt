20260102 105530 I never said that fear wouldn't find you in the night Or that loneliness was something you'd never have to fight But I did say I'd be right there by your side And I did say, I'll always help you find. Because you know I made a promise that I intend to keep. My grace will be sufficient in every time of need. My love will be the anchor that you can hold on to. This is the promise, this is the promise I've made to you.
