============================================================

Give praise to the Father, your heart not made of stone. Praise Him in the big church or in your little home. Hug up to all men He is a la la la love to all God's children For God sits on the throne, God sits in the throne So let us plan to serve him in God's un of deed. Put away all enmity, all selfishness and greed. Brother and sisters keep up whenever there is need. For God sits on the throne, good alone shall lead.
