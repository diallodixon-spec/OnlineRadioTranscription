20251229 204129 Give me the shining God in my feet so I can keep climbing The rainy mountain that is before me Cause you say you love me, what's more you adore me Feels good to get a second chance to love You love me from pain, pain to joy Unspeakable joy, unspeakable joy. Lord, I was feeling so bad. I was always sad. I didn't have no money, nowhere to go. My friends.
