============================================================

to you. I pledge my love is true. I pledge my life to you. I do, my dear. I do my dear. I'm so proud to have you by my side. You'll be my strength and I'll be your guide. You are the one, you're a dream that is real. Heaven has sent you, it's love that I feel. I know, with all my heart, we'll never part. Yes, my friend, that's how it is. They don't leave. They'll be with you, good, bad, or not, all the way to the end.
