20251216 141307 Never had trouble getting what I want But when it comes to you, I'm never good enough When I don't care, I can play him like a kitten doll Don't wash my hair, then make him bounce like a basketball But you make me wanna act like a girl Paying my nails and wear high heels, yes you Make me so nervous that I think I'd have a heart attack Never break a sweat for the other girl
