20260102 130103 I'm pleased to be chilling in the West Indies To provide all my points and needs I've got the sunshine, rivers and trees Relieved When I see you, I see your way Just take a little stray from the progress you say Every man to them own a philosophy I live the proper way and let me read a chapter daily And the inner city hungry and no heat And food they don't have country dust a drop off of the tree then You see, Sephavati no real then Is what the reals did reveal Who knows? Who knows, who knows, who knows? I just go with the trading blows, sending love to my friends.
