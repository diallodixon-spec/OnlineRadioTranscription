20251225 191611 In the meadow we can build a snowman And pretend that he is Parson Brown He'll say are you married? We'll say no man But you can do the job when you're in town Later on we'll conspire As we dream by the fire To space I'm not afraid The vows that we made Walking in the winter wonderland. When it snows, ain't it thrilling? Throw your nose, it's a-chilling. We'll probably can play the S.E.M.O. way, walking in the window wonderland. Sleigh bells ring, are you listening? In the lane, snow is glistening. A beautiful sight, we're happy tonight. Walking in the winter wonderland. In the meadow we can build a snowman. And pretend that he's a surface clown.
