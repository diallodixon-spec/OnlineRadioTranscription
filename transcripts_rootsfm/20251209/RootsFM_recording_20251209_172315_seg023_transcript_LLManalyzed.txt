Welcome back! You're listening to the evening news as we close out our news package right here on Roots 96.1 FM. We begin with sports. Glenmuir High attempted to strengthen their push for a semifinal spot in the Issa da Costa Cup this afternoon as they faced McGraw High at 3 p.m. Glenmuir and Cornwall College sit on the top of Group A with three points each after opening wins on Saturday. Another victory would move Glenn Muir within touching distance of the Final Four. McGrath, last season's runner-up, are in danger of slipping out of contention. They have lost their last two games, failing to score in both.
