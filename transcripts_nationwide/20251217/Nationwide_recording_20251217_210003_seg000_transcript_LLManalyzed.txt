20251217 210003 You listen to this EP and it carries you back to home, you see what I mean? Same for the people in the way. Love the Caribbean. You love the Caribbean and you listen to that project, you immediately feel connected to it. How many songs on the EP? It's seven tracks, but one is interlude, so six songs. Six songs. The type of music that you do, do you think that Jamaicans can really get on that wave to appreciate the sound? Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Because they do. They do, you know. They do from other artists, from other parts of the world, is what I'm saying. So true. So true. It's really just for grab them. I tell people, I'd rather people not know that it's me who creates the music before they hear the music. Because I feel like from them, they don't expect a certain kind of music. The reggae, they expect a certain kind. Hardcore reggae, roots drop thing. Dancer, they expect more of a raw chart thing. We are dealing with love and positivity, but we are doing it in an enjoyment state.
