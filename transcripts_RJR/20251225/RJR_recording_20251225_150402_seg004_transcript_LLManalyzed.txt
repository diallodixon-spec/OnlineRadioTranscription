I wrapped it up and sent it with a note saying I love you a million. But now I know what a fool I have been. Because if you kiss me now, you'll never fool me again. Baby, last Christmas, I gave you my heart. But the very next day you gave it away And this year to save me from tears I'll give it to someone special
