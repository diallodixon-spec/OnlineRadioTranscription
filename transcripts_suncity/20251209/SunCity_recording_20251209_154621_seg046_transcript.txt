I've been through a lot, but I'm still flirty. Is everybody back up in the building? It's been a minute, tell me how you're healing. Cause I'm about to get into my feelings. How you feeling? How you feel right now? Oh, I've been so down and under pressure. I'm way too fine to be distressed, yeah. Oh, I'm not the girl I once or used to be. That might be better. Turn up the music. Turn down the lights. I've got a feeling I'm gonna be all right. OK. OK. All right. It's about the time.
