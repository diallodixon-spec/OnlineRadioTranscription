20251231 122412 my family go for clarity. You don't want to hear the price of the people they put on the something. But matters are worse. Me hear say half of the thing they missing. And me know say a custom. Girl, how you know say a customs? At least I stop going like I have no sense, man. You know say everybody I talk about it in the media. You know one of us stop listen to hear say. You ever experience that? Customs not go in your package, suitcase, barrel or cargo unless you will ship the item or the agent stand up right there when they inspect it. Listen, customs job is to protect the borders, collect revenue and to facilitate trade. They don't collect or store shipment, they inspect it and somebody has to presentrepresented for inspection. Eh, so how customs ever get so much custom then? Tracy, and the customs alone involved in the clearance process, you know, even though it's them we tend to talk about. Look at it this way, shipment delayed, talk to your airline agent. Missing items, talk to your freight forwarder.
