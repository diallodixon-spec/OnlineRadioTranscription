As a group we have learned a lot of lessons and it just looks at the depth that we have and we really wanted to look at the depth and what we have because definitely we want to build the players in terms of being able to play on this platform so I'm grateful that we were able to get the opportunity to bring these new young players into the squad and we hope that we'll have encouraged by what some of the new ones that are coming through. A little bit disappointed and disheartened, but a lot of good to take from it because there were moments of good plays and a little bit of good combinations, so yeah, not the result that we wanted.
