20251216 160705 I'm sitting, not playing. Re's the finals where World Radio United goes up against Sun City 104.9 FM's Dream Team. The whistle has gone. Supreme Sunday plays the ball to Rewind Monday. Rewind Monday taps the ball to Karen Teese. Karen Teese dribble. He labs it over to Reggae Wednesday. Reggae Wednesday.
