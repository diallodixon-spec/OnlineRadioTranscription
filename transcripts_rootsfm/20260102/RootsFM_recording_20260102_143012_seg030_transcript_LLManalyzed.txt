20260102 143012 It's getting late Time marches on Just can't wait The clock keeps turning Why hesitate? You silly fool You can't change your fate Let's cut the rug Little chop and jitter butt We want the best We won't settle for less Don't be a drag Participate Clam's on the half shelf And roller skates, roller skates Good times We are on good times Leave your care behind. This is not a good time. Good time. This is not good time. I will show you.
