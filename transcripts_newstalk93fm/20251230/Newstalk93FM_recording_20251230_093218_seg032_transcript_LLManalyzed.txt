20251230 093218 So many things you didn't do do Nobody do me like you do And you take on my muse Everything my baby My rhythm and blues, So many things You did do nobody Do me carry, you play happy to lose Carry my love, put it all on you And I get the money, money for two Over my retina, when you come through Now you be my person, a person Forgot to teach you that need blessings. Other guys, they don't teach me lessons. They not only you in the distress, they still not passing. Mind, you can't mind me. Mind you, mind me. Everything mind, baby. Mind, you ain't the man blue. So many things you did do, nobody do me like you do.
