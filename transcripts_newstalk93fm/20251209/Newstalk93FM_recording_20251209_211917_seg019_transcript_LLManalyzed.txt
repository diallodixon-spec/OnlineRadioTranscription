Yeah, we have your party dancing by the thousand Rock by the thousand, coaching by the thousand Towel by the thousand, people running by the thousand Scouting by the thousand, jumping by the thousand Jumping by the thousand Last year them boys threw a party in a room The ticket sale on them wasn't good, the weather wasn't good neither I never did think about that, all I knew I was eager To find myself on a stage in front of people like a preacher. Promoter, owner of the venue and the grounds, man. Security maintenance, the patron of the song, man. When they calculate, they only get about a thousand, but don't cancel the function. We rock your party with a thousand rag, thousand fly, thousand rag, thousand flag, thousand gal, thousand man. Jump up like a thousand man. Everybody jump up.
