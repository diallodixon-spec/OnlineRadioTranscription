Importantly, the U.S. women's national team's automatic qualification will not count as one of CONCACAF's three allocated spots. As a result, three additional CONCACAF teams will still earn direct entry through the official qualification pathway, giving the region a potentially strong presence at the tournament. The expansion to 16 teams also brings the women's Olympic tournament closer in scale to other major international competitions and is expected to create a more balanced and diverse field. Further details regarding the qualification process and tournament format are expected to be confirmed by FIFA and the International Olympic Committee in the coming months.
