I'm gonna do right after that Me only spit lyrics, not really talk, a lot to know Touchdown like quarterback for my count up The money give me half of that, me coulda did for the hype or rather not You give me joy if you write rhyme on beat Lay it down like white line on street Music's sweeter just like one treat Drop it hotter than island heat Yeah me with the island flow, it coulda be digital, I don't know Hear some people say I don't grow Tell em I long for a time go show Kick it kick it like a ball I tell it You say me look better, but I tell it Give me the world and me I got shelly That time I dream with the sun and the li Give me the way the man chop it a chop When me finish if it a tit a jot Know seh my voice have a prep up on that Bad man I sit on a platan attack Mm-hmm. All right.
