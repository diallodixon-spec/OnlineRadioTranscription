The first night together Feels like the first kiss It's getting better, baby No one can better this Still holding on, still go on First time our eyes met Same feeling I get Only feelin' more stronger Don't wanna love you longer Used to turn the fire on Some feelin', feelin', only don't Guess what, baby? Yeah, you're the one I have loved I only want to make it go on. So full of you, a little more than I should.
