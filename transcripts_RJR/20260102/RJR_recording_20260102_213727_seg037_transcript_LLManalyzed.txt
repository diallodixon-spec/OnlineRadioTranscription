20260102 213727 They ma call me sick head, me no boring, me no dead, me a old tega rego, do me turn a bubble and a roll it like a tread. So me go on, come me down off the man, so me sit down and just a whine pon me song, whine pon me floor getting mad and galang. The best mix right here. 94.5. Action, ready for the thumping. Ready for the thumping, ready for thumping. Bad, bad girl, step out, I'm stunting. Quaint, hypnotize them, tick like pumpkin. Look on me, big, big jumping. My money tick like a Kami dumpling. Remix style or the vocal range. Black and beautiful, so I'm in a place. I don't cry, I don't check, I don't eye, girl.
