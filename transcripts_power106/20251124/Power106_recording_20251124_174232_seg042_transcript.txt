============================================================

Every dream and every wish Has come to life with you On the day that we first met I knew they all came true Yet to me you're so much more Than any dream of mine Teach me, baby I am at your side Never forget The way you looked when you turned to me Take that way back I can't express in words how you make me feel Never forget The sound of your voice when you said to me I wanna be your love
