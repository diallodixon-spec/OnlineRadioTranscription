20260102 164338 Of the 365 recommendations, 189 are currently being implemented by the Ministry. 18 have been completed. And remember now, the Paterson Report, designed to address long-standing gaps in our education system, spans an eight-year implementation period, all right period from 2023 to 2031. So it will be something for the medium term and please let us stay in it to win it. We wish Dr. Adrian Stokes, the chairman of the Education Transformation Oversight Committee, I wish the committee itself all the very best in the successful implementation of the 365 recommendations that formed part of the Paterson Report.
