============================================================

so Cruisers, joining me this morning is someone from the Ministry of Health and Wellness. Normally, we don't do things just like this, but we wanted to play a game. Good morning to you, Mrs. Patricia Russell. She is the program coordinator for the prevention component of the HIV STI TB unit within the Ministry of Health and Wellness. Good morning, Patricia. Good morning. Thank you for having me. Good morning.
