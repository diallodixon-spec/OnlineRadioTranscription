And the cars are under water and mud. Wow. Oh my goodness. I know competitors who have spoken to from Montego Bay, who have lost their roofs. Wow. Who have lost multiple businesses. It really has been hard. We as Team Streets couldn't see putting on an event when our brothers are feeling it like that.
