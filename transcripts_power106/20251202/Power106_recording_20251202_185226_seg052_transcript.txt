============================================================

We have moved from a yearly sale to a mixed sale. What can you tell us about the number of entries? Can you show any light on that number? Well, the number was 76. We're still open. We're still accepting entrants. So if you have folks out there who want their horses to be involved in the sale, we're still accepting entrance. I think the late fees have been waived because we want as much participants as possible. What can you tell us about yearling flow? Any encouragement there as far as the numbers go? The numbers are reduced from last year. The numbers when I last looked at it was 57 that has been entered I must say the numbers are very low and we are encouraging persons to have their horses participate in the sale because there's a lot of incentives
