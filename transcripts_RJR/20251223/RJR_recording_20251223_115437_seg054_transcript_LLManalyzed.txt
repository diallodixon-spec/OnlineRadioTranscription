20251223 115437 The 8-bit machines seem to be malfunctioning all around. Sometimes it's just two or two machines out of five in a banking hall that works. And when making deposits, no matter how small, it sometimes takes several attempts as the machine keeps rejecting some of the notes. I'd appreciate some help in getting this matter resolved and my cash credited to my account. Thank you for your help. You know, we need to investigate and see what happened in that instance, because the machine is malfunctioning. The machine may show a record, but the record may not be correct with the actual payback.
