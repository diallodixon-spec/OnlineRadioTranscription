Lauryn Hill, you know, my, it's my music, but it's some of my music because yes, my love, a lot of those rhythms from the nineties, but I'm very conscious of what, which ones are played when I do play music around them and so, you know, so a lot of ballads and things. Of course we did love, we did, and I, I did love that Cartel Vado Clash, but I didn't play that. I didn't play it in the car, unless I was alone. And I am willing to deny myself what I want to listen to at a particular time in order to ensure that I'm influencing, but I'm also mindful of the external influences. So therefore, what are some things that we can do to maintain our influence and keep our influence strong? Would you consider yourself a disciplinarian? Me? Yeah. I don't know if I've had to be really a disciplinarian.
