2025-12-12 14:41:35 But I stayed right by your side Many nights I sat with you and cried Still you turned around and designed me But I still stayed, I stayed here Tell me what I did to you To make you do me like you do me All I did was try to prove Won't prove to you that I love you Tell me what I have to give Oh Wait a minute now I know you never thought I'd write you a song You thought that I was just for Sunday morning But you've been in my heart all along now
