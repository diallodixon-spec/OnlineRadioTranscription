20251222 152115 Every time I see a water raise up the sun I'm streaming through the world in your head And every star in the sky you're taking into your eyes like a spark light The beating of a heart is a charm and it's lost and it's looking for a rhythm like you You can take the darkness from the feet of the night and turn it into a beacon that you'll never see again I gotta follow you cause everything I know but it's nothing till I give it to you
