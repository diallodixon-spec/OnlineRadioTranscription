20251222 204822 You're the landlord, and the keeper of our love You're the landlord and the keeper Who comes to see me when I just pick up the phone? Who'll rush right over When I need to cut the heat off And when my tears are flowing down the drain I don't need no calm now Cause he can unstop the pain He's my protection And all my security Everybody on the phone Everybody on the block knows that I'm privin' for a seat Ooh, I'm the watch, ooh, the keeper I'm out there, I'm out there
