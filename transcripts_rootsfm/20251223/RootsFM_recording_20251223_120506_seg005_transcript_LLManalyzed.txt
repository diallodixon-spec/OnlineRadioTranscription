We know that according to the Word of God in Ephesians chapter 6 and 12 that we're not fighting against flesh and blood enemies, but against evil rulers and authorities of the unseen world. We can't fight spiritual battles with man-made resources. And so we ask, Lord, that you give us the arsenal of spiritual empowerment to come against the evil forces. Allow this, our spiritual battles, Lord God Almighty.
