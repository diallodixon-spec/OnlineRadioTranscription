20251218 214121 Even when you're crying, you're beautiful too. The world is beating you down. I'm around through every mode. You're my downfall. You're my muse. My worst distraction, my rhythm in blues. I can't stop singing. It's ringing in my head for you My head's underwater but I'm breathing fine You're crazy and I'm out of my mind Cause all of me loves all of you. Love your curves and all of it. All of your perfectness. Make a side of person who falls in love with you.
