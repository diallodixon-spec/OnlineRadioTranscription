20251217 192920 I pray my soul you keep, though my enemies then camp with me. I know I've been stabbed, forevermore under your banner, and for always in your hand. It's me I can judge, as I've fallen my knees today. Have me God I pray, don't wanna be carried away. It's me again, John, as I fall in my knees today. Have me God, I pray, reserve my soul today.
