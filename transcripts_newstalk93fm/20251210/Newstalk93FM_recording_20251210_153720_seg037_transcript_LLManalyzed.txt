============================================================

With the alarm, I feel safe Nobody got right by my side, so I I don't need a bridge To somebody that can make me feel Safe, yeah, look I thought we're the couple But nobody ever made me feel Safe, like you Facts Cause when I'm with you, I just know I'm fine Know I'm fine You take all the pressure off my mind All the time Patient in time will not be going out my mind Safe from the problems, I don't worry Cause I'm hard to find You're listening to Sleek Radio 93 FM.
