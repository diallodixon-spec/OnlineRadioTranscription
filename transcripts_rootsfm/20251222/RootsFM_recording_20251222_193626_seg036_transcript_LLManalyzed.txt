20251222 193626 Here is the goal, back with the face Pajamas live in effect and I don't waste time On the mic with the dope rhyme Jump to the rhythm, jump, jump to the rhythm jump And I'm here to combine Beats and lyrics to make you shake your pants Take a chance, come on and dance Guys, grab a girl, don't wait, make her twirl It's your world and I'm just a squirrel Trying to get a nudge to move your butt to the dance floor. So yo, what's up? Hands in the air. Come on, say yeah. Everybody over here, everybody over there. The crowd is live and I was through this groove. Party people in's play, baby. Let the music take control. Let the rhythm move you. Let's play, let the music take your soul. Let the rhythm moves you.
