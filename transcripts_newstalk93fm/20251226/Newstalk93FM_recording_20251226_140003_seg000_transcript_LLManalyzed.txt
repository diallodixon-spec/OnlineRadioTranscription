You're listening to Sleek Radio, 93 FM. i feel your frequency from miles away you come alive with one wine baby with you i want to dance the night away one jam turn a lifetime baby so go feel away. You don't like the fast life. You look on the bright side, girl. I go take the blame. I just want you to come and light it up. Just a little winding up. Come and meet me behind the truck and we rev it up. Hold it. Keep throwing it back. I know why you stop, baby.
