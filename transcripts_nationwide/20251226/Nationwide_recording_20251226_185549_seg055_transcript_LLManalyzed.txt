20251226 185549 You don't care for me at all Care for me at all I found you a mistake To make me feel so very small Though you don't like me now I'm gonna feel someday somehow And it's gonna be too late Darling, there you go again Better go again Heard me, in front of all my wonderful friends I've been good to you, you better treat like you used to And it's gonna be too late, and I'll see you again
