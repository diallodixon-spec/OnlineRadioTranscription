============================================================

I wish you would have stayed for me like your phone man, and never leave the house without me like your poor man. Why I wish you would treat me like your whips, your girls a perfect ten, but your bins them are only a five and a six. You don't understand, what your woman from her man Why you dip on the streets all the time? The spirit is in my eyes These streets don't love you like I do You need to know that You wanna keep your woman loving you That you need to show that The love we have already takes so much effort to fill Looking for a place to have a perfect vacation
