And it's your filter, wipe on everybody inside, yeah Like yourself Like yourself Like yourself But till the party done Boy, don't try to run the line And you don't try to stop me vibe, so don't say You do what you want, I do what I like You will not get no change Cause when it comes to party, I is not the man And I know when we come to party, we don't have a plan You don't tell on who you want, come on who you want Why not who you like
