============================================================

Oh, are you happy now with your life? Well, for me, I'm breaking inside so self-assured that I could not see. I had it all when you were with me, baby. No one in the world is gonna hold me. No one can move me, no one in the world can love me like you do, baby. Every time I'm with someone loving you and I wanna run, I wanna run back to your arms again. There's no one in the world, loves me like you do. Please take me back, oh baby can't go on.
