20251230 140607 on FM. We are the unstoppable radio station at six minutes after two o'clock. Good afternoon to Sister Miller. She gave you rootology. More power to the queen of radio. In the meantime, yours truly DJ Stringer, two prints of afternoon live radio courtesy of the program, The Inner City Vibes, the last Tuesday for 2025. 2026 is just around the corner. A lot of people will be planning or will be saying they are hoping for better for 2026. 2025 for me was just a lot of stuff. A lot of stuff. Yeah, serious. Good and bad. So I want to say good afternoon to those who are just joining us, especially for the very first time. Remember, chapter a day will always chase the devil away.
