The sorrel not dark. Don't waste the sorrel. Rich! Don't waste it. I don't want no long water sorrel this year. No. The sorrel can't, can't, as we used to say in Jamaica, it can't, what we say, it can't stay put. We call, we don't want a wishy-washy sorrel. If it's dark. Rich. Yes. Johnny, you ever drink a nice sorrel, man? What? My mum used to make the best sorrels, honestly. See it there. My mum, Miss Pearl. Mama Pearl! Mama Pearl. Best sorrels, man, I'm telling you. No, if you ever get a nice sorrel in there, man, I like it whole, you know, you don't even want to drink it half, you know. True man. You sup it. Well you have to, it's thick and rich, you have to sup it. Well let me tell you, you sit there and get a cake from Rosie Murray. Me quit talk about the cake.
