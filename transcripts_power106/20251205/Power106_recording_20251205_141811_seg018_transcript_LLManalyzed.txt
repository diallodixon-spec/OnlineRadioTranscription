Good afternoon to the Commissioner of Customs Velma Ricketts Walker and her team including LaDonna Manning in the Public Relations Department of the Jamaica Customs Agency. We thank you for once again choosing Paw 106 FM to be your vehicle and your platform to showcase the value of Jamaica customs to the local and international markets especially at this time as we seek to continue relief and response efforts in response to the damage imposed.
