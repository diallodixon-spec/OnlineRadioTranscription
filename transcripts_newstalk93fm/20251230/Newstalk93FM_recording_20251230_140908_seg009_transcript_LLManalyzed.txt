20251230 140908 Let you down, my friend It was a misunderstanding So if I took it for granted Then I promise from today I'll go drunk like I never drunk Waved like I never waved Wired like I never won before Just to show you I'm sorry, I'm sorry And I need you back in my life Look at people by the truck Emotions running high We are not in the sky Death running down we high Can't you tell that we sorry? We sorry And we need you back in we high Come on to me, come on to me This is my apology, follow me, come and take me
