Oh, that's wonderful. I wish I had St. Michael's number to give out, but I don't. But we can always reach out to the school. The Holy Trinity Father can give you the contact number. I'm right here 291-4108. I'm almost at gbastion.captaincollege.com. I'm still using the school's email. This is my new one. But no, we would certainly just want to call the school. Father, what school's email? I can't remember.
