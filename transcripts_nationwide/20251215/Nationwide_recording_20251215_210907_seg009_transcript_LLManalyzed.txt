20251215 210907 I'm just a singer Who already blew his shot I get along with old timers cause my name's a reminder of a pop song people forgot And I can't keep a girl low Cause as soon as the sun comes up I cut em all loose and work's my excuse But the truth is I can't open up And you don't wanna be high like me Never really knowing why like me You don't ever wanna step off that roller coaster and be all alone And you don't wanna ride the bus like this Never know with who to trust like this You don't wanna be stuck up on that stage singing Stuck up on that stage singin' Oh, I know, I said so
