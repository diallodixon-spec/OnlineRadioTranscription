============================================================

I've been there, and then when I came out back, I know I came out back more than the time, anyway, they charged me 2,005. Yeah, man, 2,005, because that's how the time is there, up there. So it's there? Yeah, man, very expensive, and I don't understand. I know they fixed it up very well, but I think the cost and what the challenge I have, though, that they gave to us. What I noticed, they state the time, they call it the money. Some just want to know, I think it's set to be a criminal thing to me. I don't know if that's the experience of people or not. They can't tell you, suppose you have been there for three hours then, for instance, or one hour, and then they set off to pay the fee in two, five, but they say, all right, yeah, because I've tried that, you know, tried to set, then they couldn't do anything different, and it's like they could, but I don't pay it out of faith to see the reaction. But the cost is too high anyway, you get me?
