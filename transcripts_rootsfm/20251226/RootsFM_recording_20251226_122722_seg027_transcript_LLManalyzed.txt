20251226 122722 Morning light, the city wakes Footsteps echo, the ground shakes Chasing dreams on a winter's breeze With every deal we find our ease The bells are ringing, the crowds collide Hearts racing fast, there's nowhere to hide With bags in every smile we're living in style Grab the moment, don't let it slip. For this money deal, we're taking a trip. Oh, it's a boxin' day rush. Feel the magic, feel the rush.
