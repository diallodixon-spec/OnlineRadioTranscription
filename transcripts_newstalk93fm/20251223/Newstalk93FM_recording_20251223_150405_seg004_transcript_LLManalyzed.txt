20251223 150405 I don't know about you but I come here to fight Come to play a match I'm not leaving until I wet wet Come to play a mass I don't live my life with regrets No, I come to jam on a bumper Come to drink out the liquor Until my head gone And I'm miserable All down on the ground I'm causing trouble Look how the security watch me They don't know I'm out there And And they smash up this place, and then they start like a zombie. And to one way, they don't want me in their prozine. They don't want me cause I do. One way, they don' want me in their Prozine.
