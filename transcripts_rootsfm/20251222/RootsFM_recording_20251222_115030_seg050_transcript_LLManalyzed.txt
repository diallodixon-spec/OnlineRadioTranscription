20251222 115030 this morning so many of our seniors in our country are going through a difficult painful existence mighty god they lie down in pain and be weak in pain but for this morning i lift up a voice to you ask you have mercy oh god i call into your loving kindness lay your healing hands upon them touch their bodies mighty god give them some rest hallelujah in the mighty name of the rest from the excruciating pain mighty god that is really gripping their bodies wherever the pain lies this morning we're asking for for morning's blessing, we're asking for morning blessing of healing upon the sinners of our country. And there are adults, there are juniors, there are little children who also go into the same situation.
