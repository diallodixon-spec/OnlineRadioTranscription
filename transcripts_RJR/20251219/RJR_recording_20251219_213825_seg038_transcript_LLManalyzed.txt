20251219 213825 If I don't dance all the reggae, come give me wave. Give me reggae dance all in the day. Give me rhythm, no give me a case. Select a sound that you love me. Dance on me in everything. Dance all out with everything. When dance all day, sound system day. Yachtman day. Dancers day. Oh, dance all sweet. Pull up. Pull up. When a bad song drop that. Pull up, pull up. I'm here on yellow. Pull up, Pull up. I'm your bad yellow. Pull up. Oh, the gasping of the damn glove. Pull up.
