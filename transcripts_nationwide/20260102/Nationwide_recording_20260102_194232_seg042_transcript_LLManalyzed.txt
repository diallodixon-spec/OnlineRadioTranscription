20260102 194232 are being repaired and brought back online, supported where needed by field hospitals. I want to especially recognize our nurses and doctors who have given unbroken service throughout this disaster, and I extend sincere commendations to all our first responders, the JCF, the JDF, and our emergency teams, who ensured a credible and effective relief response. There was extensive damage to homes, and I know many Jamaicans cannot rebuild on their own or need additional support. Because of the sound economic management of my administration, we are in a position to respond effectively, as we did during COVID-19 with one of the largest direct social care programs in our history, and again after burial when over 16,000 Jamaicans received rehabilitation and rebuilding grants. Shortly, we will launch a targeted home repair and household rehabilitation program for persons assessed as being tangibly affected
