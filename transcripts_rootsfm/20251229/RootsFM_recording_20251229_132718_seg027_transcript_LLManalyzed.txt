20251229 132718 All that's given, all the earth, she loves her children So true, fresh fruit from the garden As I wake in the morning And your face just be glowing How you happy I notice I just want you to notice That your presence is golden So much things I be holding Just wait for the right time Which just never arrive side My mind is like tider Twisting and pleating What you do, she repeating So much colors and meaning when you look in the sky try to imagine it open as the carriage is rolling watching stories unfolding better known than unspoken all those things that you told me like how you feel when a touring missing me in surroundings and me need you around me all we need is this moment to stay with me till morning, morning When you're driving through Kingston, who do you listen to?
