20251216 110403 This wonderful place, all the things we remember all through our lives. Just hear the sleigh bells, tickle in rain, tickle in dew. Come on, it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you. Outside, the snow is falling and friends are calling you through. Come on, It's lovely weather for sleigh rides together with you. Kitty up, kitty up, kitty up, giddy up, giddy up, it's great Just hold in your hand We're gliding out around With the song of a wintering fairyland Our cheeks are nice and cozy And comfy, cosy or witty We're snuggled up together like two birds of a feather would be Let's take them all before we set the scene on chorus or two Come on, it's windy, but we'll always stay right together with you
