20251226 164722 We and them boys, can't be no friend no more. Alright folks, it's your Boxing Day Racing Card. It's the penultimate race of the day. Race number 10. A very competitive field of 12 horses. I'm going to tell you who I like. I like a long shot here. So if you don't have him in your exotics, run to the window. You have maybe about a minute left. Number 8 is going to hit the board. Noble Sovereign now 16-1. I watched a lot of tapes last night. This is one race I focused on and I really do like Noble Sovereign to be first, second or third.
