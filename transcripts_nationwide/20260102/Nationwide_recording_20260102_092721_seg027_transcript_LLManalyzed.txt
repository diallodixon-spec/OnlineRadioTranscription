20260102 092721 I reported to you the second, this is the third time I'm calling you to change into Flow. But I'm not getting any internet at home. You're still Flow, still sending me a bill and they are getting paid. I went to the office sometime last month, before the month, when I went here. I asked to speak with one of the supervisors. I was told to log in and say I'm not logging in. I think I waited too long. I did too much of this. The supervisor is coming. She's dealing with some of it. And I've been there up front a little much. Everybody come to me. And I have to leave. I went back there. Today is Friday, I went back there Wednesday. When I went there, they closed at 1 o'clock, so apparently I went too late. I did not know that they have an early closure. And I'm sick and tired of these things. They said they have been now for January and I don't get the internet.
