20251212 131307 You're a season of grief, you're a season of tears Your heart has been broken and so filled with pain I know you are hurting, I know how you feel Your nights seem more darker without sunshine ahead It will get better It will get better Won't last forever Won't last forever And if you trust in the Lord, your lives will turn today Just remember, it will get better
