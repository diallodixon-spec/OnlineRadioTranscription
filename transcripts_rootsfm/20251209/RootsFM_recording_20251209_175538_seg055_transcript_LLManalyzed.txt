Yeah, you're listening to Loose FM 9611. So we go back to the ancient ways, and told secrets that remained unchanged. Mentally get unchanged. Got to stay true to the things you know are right. Nothing worth the game you attain by sudden flight. Rather keep your goals in sight, even in the darkest night. Have faith in the Father, the one who shines your light.
