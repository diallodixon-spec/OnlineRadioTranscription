20251222 192715 said this from the very beginning yeah one of the concerns I think though Debbie is that people in and I'm going to say this side of the island the side that Melissa hadn't badly affected a lot of people feel boy I'm a tad for hear a hurricane story now you know I can't hear that I can't hear it it is it is I believe, should do more. I don't see anything that they're doing. I don one, they're tired of hearing the story of them. And the other thing I hear from people is that this side of the island, a lot of people actually don't think it's as bad. I've heard people come up from Western Jamaica and say they feel angry at the kind of attitude they're getting.
