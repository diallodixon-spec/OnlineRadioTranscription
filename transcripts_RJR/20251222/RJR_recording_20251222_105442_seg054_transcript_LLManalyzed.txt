20251222 105442 between the English, the British, and the Maroons. I don't know if the Maroons have ever seen it, or do you know, it is not a public document, it has not been displayed anywhere, is it a document that this has been around? I don't know. It could, but I really don't know, I haven't seen it. I haven't done any research in that regard. I just heard the discussions around it. Nothing that isn't as to where it is, I really couldn't say. And I didn't feel the need to do so. I mean, I took it at the word that there was such a treaty. And so a Maroons have the relationship we have. I have never heard any animosity between the Maroons and the general public in Jamaica.
