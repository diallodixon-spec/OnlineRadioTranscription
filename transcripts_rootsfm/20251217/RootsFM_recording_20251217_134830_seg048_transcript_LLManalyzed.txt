20251217 134830 Come give me what me desire Beat you with the wire, make me sing like a choir Come ya Sean, come give me little light Spark it up, cause me need little fire in la mi life What a long time me no get to see you Panty wetter than the water way in la di rail Take me a yoke, like a me a me Jesus Come one then two then three Baby won't you light my fire? Can you take me higher? I spy, I spy That you see something you might like Won't you come over if you really feel it? Ask all your questions, it's all real and real. But come to see you with your crew, just a boom and I'll go true. And I can tell, say you admire the realness. Look at me looking at you, now you don't know what to do. Just relax and I'll go in on your feelings.
