Don't let the pressures of the system get up on your head. Poor people, there is something for you. Mankind can't care not for his sisters anymore. Still, there's something for you. Each and every time you see with a word of a door, there will be something fun. Blessed be the man who hear not in a peon ground Blessed be the herbs that keep we high in a peon stone For your fear man we sit down in a bauble and churn Kill this woman go a dance and left a picnic dem alone Cannot take care of yourself dig it dey and read in a rum Population and the pressure still dem have more money clout
