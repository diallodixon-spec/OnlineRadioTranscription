But these sweet dreams do ease my mind, I say What's success without a little sacrifice? With every downfall, yes, you have to have a rise Yeah, in the world to lose your soul, no, but not to pay that price I forgive tons of life born in sadness, my life Victory, when you win it, it's a sweet story But when you're not there, the world is bitter It's quick to call me a sinner Only judge I know my history So we know what it takes Through it all we survive, yet still hold the faith Unchangeable, Lord, unchangeable No matter how the dollar might stack up, me still not change, me a go stay rough
