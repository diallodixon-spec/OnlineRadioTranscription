20251226 150304 It's a weekend. And it's a Saturday. And it's not a double rule. We work so hard every week. We don't want no part of that. I need a stress reliever. Two drinks in me hand and a girl in the middle. That's the girl we need to find, the middle of the road is where you'll find me and my friend and them because we work so hard, so hard for what we do.
