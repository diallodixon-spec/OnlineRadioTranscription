20251219 164839 I think it's time to tell you what's on my mind. I'm afraid to show you how I feel. But I think now's the time. You should know that I love you. And I always have hope and you feel the same It would be so sad to lose our friendship this way But it would be a shame to never know what we could become if we were in love. I'm a little apprehensive. I don't want to wreck what we have right now.
