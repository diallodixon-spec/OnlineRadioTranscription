But let me see, you know. But thanks for keeping it on our agenda my sister i haven't heard anything new i know that you know is a bit busy now but i said like how you know how those equipment now is available now i said i wonder if it will be available available to come outside or you know it has to go down that side yes so i don't know what you can do for us. Well, I just keep on waiting. But are you doing exactly what you need to do? Keeping it on our agenda here? Yeah, but you have to keep it on his agenda for us. True that, true that, true that. Thank you very much.
