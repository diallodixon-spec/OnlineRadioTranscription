One more night, give me just one more night, girl one more night, cause I can't live without you. One more night, here we give it one more night, a million more nights, I can't sleep without you. Cause everyday I say I want you in my life. Cause I don't want you to wake up if you're not there by my side. I beg me, I beg you to apply. It's one of my priorities. I'm well to call without you and I'm feeling scared hiding. I remember when you said you need me all day. Make love from the room to the hallway girl. I don't really want you to learn the hard way. I'm not afraid to say please girl stay. One more night, give me just one more night Girl, one more night, cause I can't live without you
