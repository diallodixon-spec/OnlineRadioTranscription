20251219 165844 A St. Catherine man has been sentenced to 18 months in prison after admitting to stealing batteries and cables from a digital telecommunications facility. 27-year-old Eric Robinson appeared in the St. Catherine Parish Court on Tuesday, where he pleaded guilty to malicious destruction of property, simple arson and trespassing on the works of a telecommunication entity. Acting Senior Parish Court Judge Janelle Nelson Gale handed down the sentence, noting that Robinson was not eligible for a reduction because of a previous conviction. The court imposed 18 months on each charge, which the sentences will run concurrently, meaning he will serve 18 months in total. Police say the case stems from a report made by Digicel in June, after batteries and cables were stolen from one of the company's sites. Robinson was later arrested during investigations.
