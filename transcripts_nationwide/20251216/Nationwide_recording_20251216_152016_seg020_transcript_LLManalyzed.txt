20251216 152016 I've been ignoring this big lump in my throat I shouldn't be crying, just what for? Weaker days, I'm stronger now Also I say, but something's missing Whatever it is, it feels like it's laughing at me Through the glass of a two-sided mirror Whatever it is, it's just laughing at me And I just wanna scream What now? I just can't figure it out What now? I guess I'll just wait it out What would I do without your smile now? Drawing me in and you kicking me out You've got my head
