20260101 120104 a targeted home repair and household rehabilitation program for persons assessed as being tangibly affected by Hurricane Melissa. The JDF, along with volunteer engineering corps from Ghana and Guyana, is already restoring roofs. Modular, semi-permanent housing solutions have been ordered to provide shelter for those who have lost their entire homes. Hurricane Melissa has given us an opportunity to build forward better. To lead this effort, we will establish the National Reconstruction and Resilience Authority with special powers to coordinate a cohesive economic and infrastructure plan for roads, schools, hospitals, security, local government, housing, land regularization, tourism, agriculture, logistics, mining, and the creative industry. This is our opportunity to purposefully build the Jamaica of the future. The Jamaica we all dream of. We have secured over U.S.
