20260101 091410 Say goodbye those tears I cried No, I can't get over it So don't you ever let me down again Cause I'm depending on you So you better come through this time Please hear my cry and if I ever let you down, my friend, it was a misunderstanding. So if I took it for granted, then I promise from today I'll go drunk like I never drunk, waved like I never waved, whined like I never wanted to, just to show you I'm sorry, I'm sorry. And I need you back in my life. Look at people buying a truck, emotions running high. We're up in the sky, tears running down we eye. Can't you tell that we're sorry? We're sorry, and we need you back in we lie. I need back up back up.
