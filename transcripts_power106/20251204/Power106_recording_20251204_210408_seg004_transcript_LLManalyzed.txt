So I really fell inside And I know I'm still in love, still in love I'm gonna do all you want me to do Don't ask me no questions, I'll tell you no lies It's something that happened in which I could disguise If Who needs somebody to take me away? The demons of death, which in my mind they lay? Who was then the one?
