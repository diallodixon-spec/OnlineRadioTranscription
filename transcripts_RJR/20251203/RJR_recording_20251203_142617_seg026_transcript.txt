I love you, I want you I need you in my life Can't you see what you mean to me Baby come hold me tight I miss you, wanna kiss you Every time I see your face Baby I'm here waiting for you Each and every day I love you I want you You're the one that I live for And I can't forget you anymore. I love you. I need you. Baby, I'm not like you. You're the only one for me. Oh, yeah. You're my only one for me, and I know it's been a bit long.
