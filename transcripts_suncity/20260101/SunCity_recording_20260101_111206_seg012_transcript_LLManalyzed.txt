The way we held each other's hands The way we talked, the way we laughed It felt so good to fall in love And I knew right then and there you were the one I know that he loves me cause he told me so I know that he loved me cause his feelings show When he's dancing with me, you see he can't ask for me You see how he is so deep in love I know that he love me cause it's obvious I know that he loved me cause it's me
