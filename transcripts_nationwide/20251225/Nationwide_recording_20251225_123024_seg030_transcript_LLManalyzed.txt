20251225 123024 I wanna wrap you up, baby, they will see You're the only person I need There's so much more Waiting for you in this tunnel On this precious day I can't get you safe There's no place I'd rather be Oh, you're all my everything Come a little closer, baby, you are my everything You're my little girl, so you're my stepson You're the one for me You're my soul, you're my soul Outside is cold, but the fire is blazing You're baby, baby, let it snow Let it snow It's cold, it's cold
