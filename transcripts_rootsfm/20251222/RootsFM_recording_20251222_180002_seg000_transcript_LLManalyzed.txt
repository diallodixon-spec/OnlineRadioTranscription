I am a champion friend. So I ain't hungry and edge-eyed teeth. I ain't stand up on me own two feet. Me nah make no trouble come and get rid of me. I fight it like a champion, Muhammad Ali. But that no mean I'm gonna go do no folly. Rasta man and a Satan little puppet, Dolly. Push on pon this shit and roll like a Charlie. Her goodness and mercy are fall back on me.
