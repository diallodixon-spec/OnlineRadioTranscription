Just me, myself and I and my shadow Lights out It's the darkest time for me Lights out My two hands out but I just can't feel Lights out Everything seems blank just a think, oh Forget myself out of this dark up till dusk Me see good friends gone, girl we did close A just life, let nature take its course Yo it hurt me the most But then me stick to the dream cause we been close Think me hood a dead a ring a jeep
