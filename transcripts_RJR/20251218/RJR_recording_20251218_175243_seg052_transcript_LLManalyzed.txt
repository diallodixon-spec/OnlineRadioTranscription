You know, we've come such a far away and I had occasion to reflect on it today because we did have the head of the Loss and Damage Fund coming out of that climate financing set up who was here and I was giving them the background and we went through the areas and when we started clearly the day after you couldn't you couldn't be here you know everywhere was debris there was no cars could drive and the town was just shambolic to say the least clearly the roadways are now accessible you can move around it today gives me great hope because when I came on on the street that has the courthouse that I saw that the JPS had set up the poles, I said yes. When I went down Crane Road and I saw the JPS on the poles, I say well you know that's hopeful. So definitely a lot of cleaning has happened. A lot of the re-removal has happened. Business
