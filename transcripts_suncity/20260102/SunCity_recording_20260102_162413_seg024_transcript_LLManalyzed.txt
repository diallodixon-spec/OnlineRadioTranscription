20260102 162413 God bless you! God bless you! Father, God, I pray, you blessed me today. Protect can't draw me out and turn me in jail. I don't call Jack if he come give me no bail. I'm ready, I don't need no agents. Walk with God like Mr. Binahel Max. Now say they are my friends and I find out the facts. That's why I stay in my zone of labor. Please believe me, I say I call friends a failure.
