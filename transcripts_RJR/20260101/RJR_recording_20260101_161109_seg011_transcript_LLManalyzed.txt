20260101 161109 We have another break coming up, but before you go Sly, I want to talk a little bit, I want to give some advice to some of the young ones in the business, because you have a lot of experience, a lot of success, a lot of knowledge, that for years, that means you're talking about over 50 years. I'm just trying. No, no, no, you're more than trying, you're succeeding and very well. Well, I want to tell you something, say, everything is God working, it's God, you know, so I don't know what that means sometimes. And that might be the first lesson where you have to teach them, so it's not just them. When I was younger, I still pray every day, I used to pray as God told me to be a good drummer, never say the best. And when I see it manifest, I couldn't believe it, you know. I used to call him and he'd always call me and say, boy, you would man your body, you know.
