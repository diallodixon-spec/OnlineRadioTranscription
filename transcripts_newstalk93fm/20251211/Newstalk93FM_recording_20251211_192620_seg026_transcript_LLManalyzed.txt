No Cause if loving me is jail Then you're my prisoner So let me throw away this key Cause you won't give me up Let em know we don't give a f**k All they want is to see us breakin' up You can search the seven seas and never find no A heart like mine, better yet can't forget my mind, no Some may say a girl shouldn't lay her cards on the table But I'm a woman, I'm not a girl, it's like a crime in this cruel world And so what? I fell, you fell in love a couple times Tell me, what's it to ya? Tell me, is it a crime to fall, to fall in love, in love? A couple times, tell me What's it to ya, tell me
