20251225 131411 It's the best time of the year. Look around, Christmas is here. I've got gifts for everybody wrapped under the tree. I'll be cooking all day with my family. So put on something nice and dance with me. We got so much left to do. Merry Christmas to me, Merry Christmas When you're in there Jingle bell, jingle bell, oh it's time Relax your body and free your mind Nothing else but nice like Christmas time Did somebody order a Christmas wine?
