20251226 110906 I'm a neighbor, disabled I'm like a fable, a fear You've got a woman to go home to I've got to find me myself a woman What I wouldn't do man Lucky you, you've got some kids to attend to I got to find myself a woman, what I wouldn't do myself Sometimes when I'm passing I would see you and your family together laughing But right now right now I'm feeling alone right now I need someone to call my own right now i feel as if i'll pick up the phone and call and ask the kids out there all right at home but oh lucky you you've got a woman to go home to i've got to find me myself a woman
