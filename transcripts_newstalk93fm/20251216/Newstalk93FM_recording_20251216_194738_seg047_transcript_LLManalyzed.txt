20251216 194738 I know better, it not easy Time testing but I'm strong With love on my mind, loving my thoughts, carrying on Why nobody no believe in a love again Because every love that lost Nobody no believe In that God again Seems our faith is lost Nobody no believe And it hurts more Turn the lights on The world's so dark Still I believe That love is everlasting Yes I know Love is everlasting, yeah I believe love is everlasting I know love is everlasting
