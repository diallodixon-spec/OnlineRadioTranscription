20251230 101309 you know, I want to thank all those who have gone to these areas to assist our people, every single individual, every single organization, because from the last six weeks, two weeks of the hurricane, our prime minister went into Parliament and spoke about issuing some food vouchers, stock in corner shops, and give them salaries and things like these so that people can go and collect what they want. It is six weeks after I speak that, and not one person has been given a voucher. Suppose these organisations are not going to pay for them. What would have happened to these people?
