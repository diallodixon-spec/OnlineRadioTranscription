20251212 134429 Alright, so Michael, on behalf of Royal Computers and Spectrum Management Authority, we want to congratulate you on answering your question correctly. And he is now the brand new owner of a new water-resistant Bluetooth speaker. Stick around. We have more questions. And guess what? The harder the question, the bigger the prize. So don't worry about it. Hotter the buckle, the sweeter the victory. DJ String.
