Rock by the thousand, coaching by the thousand Towel by the thousand, people running by the thousand Scanting by the thousand, jumping by the thousand Jumping by the thousand Last year them boys threw a party in a room The ticket sale on them wasn't good, the weather wasn't good neither I never did think about that, all I knew I was eager To find myself on a stage in front of people like a preacher rags, thousand rags.
