20251215 215637 I wanna be there when you open your eyes I want you to be the first thing that I see I want to wake up with you I want to lay by your side, baby I want to feel every beat of your heart And throughout the night I wanna hold you tight I wanna wake up with you All the love inside me has been sleeping Waiting for you
