20251224 121311 tough series um very below par from my my standards and I didn't really lead from the front on the field I thought that leading in terms of words and encouraging and inspiring the team that was all good and well but in terms of going out there and producing for the team and letting the team have someone to look up to as a leader I thought I let myself down and the team down as well yeah well I've been working here on some of the deficiencies that the coaches have been seeing in terms of the dismissals.
