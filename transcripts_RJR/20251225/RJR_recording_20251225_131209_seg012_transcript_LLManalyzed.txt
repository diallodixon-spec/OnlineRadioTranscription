20251225 131209 And I tell you that it's Christmas. It's Christmas. A wonderful Christmas, a wonderful Christmas. It's the best place to look around. Christmas is here. I'll be dancing and singing my favorite songs. Santa Claus and I really get along. So put up all the lights. Grab the tree. We got so much work to do. Merry Christmas to me. Merry Christmas to you. When're in it Jingle bell, jingle bell, oh it's time Relax your body and free your mind Nothing else but nice like Christmas time Did somebody burn our Christmas wine?
