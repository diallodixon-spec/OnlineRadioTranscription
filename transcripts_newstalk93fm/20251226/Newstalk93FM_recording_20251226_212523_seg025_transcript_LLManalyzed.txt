20251226 212523 I don't care, I tell you nothing, I don't care I don't care if you don't want to I don't care We are the island I don't care If I don't come home any morning Just know that I say it's not in my place But this mass have a hold on me I can't leave Until every single bus is done If anyone looking for me then You can find me where power shakes Higher beating, people get it So complain if they want to know Tell them you can find me out on the road Get ready to walk, chest up holdin' Time to feel, Carnival won't let me go To send a third party to find me Out on the road, I'll line it Tell them that Soka have made it
