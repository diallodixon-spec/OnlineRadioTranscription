20251215 215744 Is this a dream? Am I awake? Moon on your skin Hands round your waist Music is love And I heard you not play The way how you move it, feel it, feel, it, feel it? Baby, tell me, can you feel it? Feel it. Make me know when you are feeling it, feeling it, no, no. Make me know, when you are feeling. Is this a dream? Am I awake? Moon on your skin, hands round your waist.
