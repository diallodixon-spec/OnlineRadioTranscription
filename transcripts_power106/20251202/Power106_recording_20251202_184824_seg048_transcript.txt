Good evening and thank you for having me. Absolutely. All right. Change of date means certain adjustments that have to be made. What was the original date? Well, the date of December 7th has been agreed. We believe that a rich race meet as the Mutemai will be conducted on the 6th of December and we believe all the racing players are going to be around so it will be a good day for people to come after the Mutemai, people who are enthused and who are dissatisfied by the day.
