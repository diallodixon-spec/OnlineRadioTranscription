So thank you again, Dr. Andrea Daly, Diabetes Educator, for sharing with us a checklist as to how we are able to manage our diabetes. Remember, review all your medications early. Plan for your travel. Monitor your blood sugar regularly. Adjust your medication timing if there's a need for that. If you've eaten too much or eaten too little, make sure you make that adjustment. Stay hydrated and limit your alcohol. This has been a very good show Dr. Delia and we want to thank you again.
