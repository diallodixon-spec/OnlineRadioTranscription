My hands up high I'm whining low I'm glad you're cool Make a niver, baby, oh My hands up high My whining low Glad you're cool I don't want you no more That's important something sweet Tonight we're going to have some fun I will know how the people feed it. Dancing until the morning comes. Hot and groovy. Look what so-called good do we. It's happy in a time again. Feel like a movie.
