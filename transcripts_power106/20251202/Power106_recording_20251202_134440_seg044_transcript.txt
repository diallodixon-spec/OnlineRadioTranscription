have any such system right then I came on here and I said I don't think the PMP should be collecting money either without having a system either because if the knife can't stick goat it can't stick sheep right I came and say that all right then I see a text this morning two texts actually I saw one saying that the that the PMP don't the person was saying the same thing like me, but with some venom, right? And then I saw another person say them have one, but it not update. And you get to realize that the people in Jamaica, whether or not the PMP have one and it not update or they don't't have one or whatever, is that the point? The people in Jamaica are so caught up in the segmentary factionalism, in this war between labour rights and comrades, that they generally don't care about the truth. And that is my biggest problem, you know. We don't care what the truth.
