20251229 093422 Call me and take a second to give to me that magic you made. And every day, love me your own special way. Melt all my heart away with a smile For you I'd give a lifetime of stability Anything you wanted me Nothing is impossible for you There are no words, no ways to show my love Or all the thoughts I'm thinking of Cause this life is no good
