20260101 162111 Between us And it seems it's getting harder to relate Never in the wildest dreams that I imagined Life this way I wanna know what good it all feels. Good love, good love. I wanna love that sure to stand the test of time. I wanna know what love feels like. Morning, noon, noon and night Forever on my life I wanna know what good love feels like Who'd love, good love? I wanna love that shoulder, stand up, stand all time
