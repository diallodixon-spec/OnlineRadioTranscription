20260101 210101 Far, we're takin' us a little the cooker One time it says it's all for the cooker Don't sleep when you know you got a cooker One time this is all for the for the good girl Wanna roll, wanna roll with a good girl Wanna turn this into a song for a good girl And I still keep it real, still treat you like a shit, what's up? All my mind, I've passed my bedtime No rest at the kingdom Alone in the place, my heart is away
