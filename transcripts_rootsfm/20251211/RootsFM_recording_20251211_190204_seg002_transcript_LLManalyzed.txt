2025-12-12 04:57:33 Tonight I gave in to believing I'll hear you say You'll always stay Somebody turned my life around And I'm not the same Suddenly I don't hear a sound, only your name. And I really need you. Tonight, I give in to the feelings. Yes, tonight, I give into the parade of love loving you. Tonight I give in to believing we'll always stay in love this way.
