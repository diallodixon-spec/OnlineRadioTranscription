Some say it's a mystery how I still believe that in spite of all I've been through I can still push the wheel, see I have a power they can't see with their eyes It's a little thing called faith That makes broken wings fly. I rise. I rise. No, I'm hurting but not broken. Down but I won't die. I rise, I rise tonight.
