20251231 111916 is the hardest thing I've done. If I knew that you were right there, then I'd never write this song. Joy is yours and mine. The story of our love is so divine. Look you in the eyes. The pleasure is all mine. Sing the chorus one more time. Say, Lord, I'm nice. So nice, so nice, so nice. Never catch a vibe that feels so right so right When you're not around I close my eyes and fantasize Lord, he's sweet So sweet, so sweet, so sweet Every time he pass me skin me teeth Me and the melody and him and the beat are so complete You are the one, the only one me happy confess You are the one so me not run out and test. All I wanna do, give my all to you. Oh, oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.
