My sister Sandra and Kira sound. Want to grab me like your controller And make note of how me wheels are moving so nice Yes, I'm on the romantic call Talking to my baby over the yard I'm on a romantic call Need a Ike or you can't go take me from I don't want the call then, tell her you want then and say you love her from when Hey, won't stop, nothing to borrow from them, you're no star When you're buying a pam-pam, your phone line ring, ring up your skin Now ease up a bit, pressure me a bit And if you don't pick it up, I'll love less than me a bit
