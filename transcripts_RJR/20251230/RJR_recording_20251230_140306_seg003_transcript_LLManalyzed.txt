China has proposed strict new rules for artificial intelligence to provide safeguards for children and to prevent chatbots from offering advice that could lead to self-harm or violence. Under the planned regulations, developers will also need to ensure their AI models do not generate content that promotes gambling. The announcement comes after a surge in the number of chatbots being launched in China and around the world. Once finalized, the rules will apply to AI products and services in China, marking a major move to regulate the fast-growing technology, which has come on intense scrutiny over safety concerns this year. Those are the business headlines. Headlines next at 3 o'clock.
