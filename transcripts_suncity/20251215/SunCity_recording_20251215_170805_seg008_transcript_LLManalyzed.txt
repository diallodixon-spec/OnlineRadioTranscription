Reports say the yellow school bus was carrying too many students, some standing on the steps when an emergency lever was allegedly pulled, causing the door to open. The student narrowly avoided being hit by the rear wheel. The driver reportedly continued until alerted by other passengers. The child suffered soft tissue injuries and was unable to walk for nearly two weeks. Member of Parliament Campbell is demanding answers from the ministries of transport
