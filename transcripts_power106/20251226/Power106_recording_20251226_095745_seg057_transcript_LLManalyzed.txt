20251226 095745 Now I'm gonna make you sad my baby You know I'll never make you blue Staring in your cute little eyes Oh I wanna hold you tight Way in the middle of the night Hope it's not a surprise Do you want some dinner? Or the newspaper? Staring in your cute front eyes Girl I wanna hold you tight Way in the middle of the night Hope it's not a surprise
