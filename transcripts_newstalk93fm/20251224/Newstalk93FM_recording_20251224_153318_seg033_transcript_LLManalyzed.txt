I don't care. We are the island, I don't care I tell you I'm good. I don't have a word for it. I don't can't, I tell you I can't. So pray for me. If I don't come home in the morning, just know that I say something's in my place. But this man's have hold on me I can't leave Until every single bottle down If anyone looking for me then You can find me where bomb was shaking Higher beating, people fighting So complain if they want to know
