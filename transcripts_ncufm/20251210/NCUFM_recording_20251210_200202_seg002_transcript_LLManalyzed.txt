============================================================

God sent his word. God sent his word, and he is gone. Who would he that he is to come who will heal the healing God. He is a healing God. I know you might have questions, but I know you might not have questions about why this person and that person did not get healed. I have questions. But it doesn't change the fact that God said he is a healing God and that God God's dead is really God. And God, in his word, our one God, in his same word, our one. And there's no one here without, and God can't help you here without you being here. Same thing can happen in the world.
