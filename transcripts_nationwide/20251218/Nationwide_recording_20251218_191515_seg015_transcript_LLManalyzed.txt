20251218 191515 I think around that time, being above, making this offense not particular to girls, which I think of what it was when the offense is against a person, but making it not gender specific. So whether you have sex with a minor who was a boy or had sex with a minor, who was a girl, there would be a criminal liability attached to that. But I do not recall any political position where we were trying to criminalize minor and consensual sex. My recollection of the political position was that we were seeking to criminalize adults who had sex with minors, mid-day boys or girls. So is it a situation then where the provision needs to be clarified in law? It don't just need to be clarified.
