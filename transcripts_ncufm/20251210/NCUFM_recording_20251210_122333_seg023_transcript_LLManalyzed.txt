============================================================

It's for the grace of God that I'm still here today. He was always there, no matter what came my way. I felt the presence of Him in my time of need. Standing right there just to see how about me. Oh, I made it. I made it. Don't get me here. Through any day, just call that name. It was through it all. I made it, oh, yeah. Another day's journey. Another day's journey. God kept me here. It wasn't my God that kept me here. Through it all, I've made it.
