20260101 170002 Today, think differently, think export. A message from the Jamaica Information Service. The following is a New Year's message from Prime Minister, the most honorable Dr. Andrew Holness. We give God thanks for spearing us to see 2026. And we pause to remember the lives lost to Hurricane Melissa, the third most powerful hurricane ever recorded globally, and the most destructive storm ever to strike Jamaica. Today, I'm pleased to report that approximately 90% of customers island-wide now have electricity, telecommunications, and water restored, including parts of Black River. We have launched an extensive program of school repairs and we expect all students, especially those preparing for exams, to return to classes using rotational modalities where necessary. Our hospitals are being repaired and brought back online, supported where needed by field hospitals. There was extensive damage to homes and I know many Jamaicans cannot rebuild on their own or need additional support.
