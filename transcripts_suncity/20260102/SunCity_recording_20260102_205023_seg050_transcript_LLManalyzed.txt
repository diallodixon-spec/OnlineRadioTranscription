20260102 205023 The party weekend starts now I hopped up the plane at LAX With a dream, my cardigan Welcome to the land of fame and sex Am I gonna fit in? Jumped in the cab, here I am for the first time Look to my right and I see the Hollywood sign This is all so crazy Everybody sings so My tummy's burning in the field Can I home sick? Too much pressure and I'm nervous That's when the taxi man turned on the radio And the Jay-Z What? What? What? Now we are the sunsets in those tunnel, tunnel, tunnel and the Jay-Z's song is on So I put my hands just to play my song The butterflies fly away I'm nodding my head like yeah Moving my head so fast The party weekend
