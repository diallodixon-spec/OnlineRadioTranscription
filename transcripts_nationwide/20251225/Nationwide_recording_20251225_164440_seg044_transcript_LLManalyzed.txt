20251225 164440 You say you love me and you care But you're never there near You're always on the run Now tell me this Why we can't spend no quality time Kick off and just unwind You always have something to do That's simply me, the love you're not true Cause only when you want me to hear you shout I love you Tell me where all the passion gone All of the words Tell me where is all of the tenderness And here is something else That's been bugging me for so long Tell me this Tell me if love's so nice Tell me why it hurts so bad But dang, if love, love so nice Tell me, tell me why I'm sad Missing again If love's so nice, tell me why it hurts So bad, but dang If love, love's so nice Take me, take, take me, take me No, no, no You don't love me and I don't love you
