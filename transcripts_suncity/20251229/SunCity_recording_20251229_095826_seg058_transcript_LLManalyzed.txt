20251229 095826 your supervisor and the higher management. Put on the table your work in front of higher management. Your supervisor will never succeed by taking credit of your work. Yeah, man. Stand up for yourself, but also be prepared for anything. That me always say. Because one thing me a go do in a talk, I'm no one must hear about it. Me nah quiet, but nothing I want to be quiet, and if I'm quiet about something, I'm done. So, good girl, document, prepare yourself for anything that comes with that, you know? Because that's just the reality of it. Sometimes you have people just come together, they're my friend, and even when they're not doing nothing wrong, they're doing greatness, then I would rather cut off their nose to spite their face. You understand? So, just protect yourself and start documenting every idea, everything where I forgive, any idea where I give a supervisor, drop the manager upon it so that they can say the idea is yours and it now come from a supervisor.
