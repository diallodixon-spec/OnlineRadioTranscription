Santa tell me if you're really there Don't make me fall in love again If he won't be here next year Santa tell me if he really cares Cause I can't give it all away If he won't be here next year Feeling Christmas all around And I'm trying to play it cool But it's hard to focus When I see him walking across the room Let us know it's blasting out But I won't get in the mood i'm avoiding every mistletoe until i know it's true love that he thinks of so next christmas i'm not all alone boy Santa tell me
