20260102 185133 and obviously from the result against Wolves you know you can see that you know the team the squad is lacking in depth all right let's go to the EPA table very quickly all right Arsenal out in front 19 rounds completed so it's going to be round 20 next 45 points Manchester City failed to break it then look at the stadium of lights which was my fear 41, 41 points. And then we have Aston Villa in third, 39 points. Liverpool in fourth, 33 points. So after this round, the top four will remain as they are. Not no challenge there except, well, let's say Liverpool now up to fourth on 33 points and Chelsea on fifth on 30 points. All right. Now let's go now to the bottom and see if anything interesting has changed there. All right.
