20251226 125832 and the new sports and current affairs crew who keeps this ship steady. It's been my pleasure being your holiday cruise captain. I want to remind you that the holidays are about carrying joy from the kitchen to the living room, from laughter to love and from one heart to another. As we eat up all that holiday food, eat that cake and drink that sorrel, let's remember to slow down, you know? Let's try to be healthy with it. As we drop our anchor today, I want you to take that holiday spirit with you. May your seas be calm, may your sails be bright, and your celebrations full of cheer.
