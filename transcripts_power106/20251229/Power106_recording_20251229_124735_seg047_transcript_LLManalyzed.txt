20251229 124735 Hey, welcome back everyone. Welcome back. Somebody wants to know what those four, those four Jamaicas, what they look like. But I will respond to this quickly and then get back to that. Why did the police make an arrest without sufficient evidence to convict? Isn't that injustice at the highest level? We have a very poor judicial process with no checks and balances. I wouldn't say the judicial system in Jamaica is poor. Sometimes it's all we have. But the truth is just the approach of the state towards these four Jamaicans actually really, really bother me. Yeah? Okay? And I have no problem at all. I know people making a big fuss about how long it has taken them to make some arrests. I have no problem with you taking three years to arrest somebody.
