I only communicate with two of my schoolmates now. Wow. Somebody else says all of the above still have friends from primary school. Cause I'm a real one. Yeah. Yeah. Like there's some people in my primary school too that I still, you know, like follow on social media, you know, things like that. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Absolutely. Somebody say miss lady says ring leader. She said big up Facebook. We still say happy birthday and like pics on Facebook. Your Facebook is not going to let you forget. Absolutely not. They just say highly converse unless it's a comment section. You know, Facebook is not going to let you forget! Somebody says ringleader and we're still keeping touch. It says sweet 293 underscore royal. Somebody else says ringleader. Okay, everybody a ringleader over here. They actually say I marched to the beat of my own drum, fit in with every crew, but only had one or two real friends at a time. That's really the most I can manage anyway. Janelle Brown says due to all.
