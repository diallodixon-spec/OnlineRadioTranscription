20251212 172218 what you saw and what you took away from the developments within that last race. Take us through what you saw there. Well, what I saw in the last race particularly is that Red Bull seemed to have turned up the wick throughout the whole entire weekend, you know, and Max went with blood in his eyes to try to overtake this world title, but it's just that he could not do it alone. He to have the help from you know not just his team but others as well to try to secure Lando in fourth and you know that did not happen Lando did enough to have himself in third position which is exactly what he needed at minimum well no like if he if he was overtaken by Leclerc then he would have been level on points and it would have come down to race wins or something like that. But he did what he had to do and I think that we saw a very different pace of the Red Bull over the weekend. The McLaren still showed strong pace.
