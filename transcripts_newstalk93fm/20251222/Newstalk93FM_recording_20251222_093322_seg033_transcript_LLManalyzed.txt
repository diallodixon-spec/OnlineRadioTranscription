20251222 093322 I don't know about you but I come here to fret Come to play a mass I'm not leaving until I wet Come to play a mass I don't live my life with regrets, no I come to jam on a bumper Come to drink on a liquor Until my head's gone and I'm miserable All down on the ground, I'm causing trouble Look how the security are watching me They don't know I'm out there I didn't smash a big place And I didn't crack like a jumbo I do one way They don't want me in their party They don't want because I do one way
