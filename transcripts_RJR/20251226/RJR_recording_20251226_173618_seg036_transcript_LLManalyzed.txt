20251226 173618 And just before the break, we were talking about the perception of people. And as the song say, enough people can believe that we have a bobsled team. What was the reaction like of the persons from other countries which have more resources, are better financed? Shane, what was the response like? Congratulations. Even one of the members of the Brazilian bobsleigh team, the younger guy said to one of my managers that Shane is going to win the race and you have this Korean guy who always telling me that I'm gonna win. So they know I am gonna win before I even know that I'm going to win so that's that's their reaction and that's what they basically say to me from time to time. Just before the break also I don't remember who it was we're talking about a warm-up exercise and others mimicking the warm-up.
