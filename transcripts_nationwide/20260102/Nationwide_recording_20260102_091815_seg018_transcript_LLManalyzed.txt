20260102 091815 I am your boss. You make some people ask questions now. And worse of all, today is their birthday. So I say happy birthday to the big man himself. You don't know if it's the big man's birthday today. Yeah, I told him happy birthday earlier. Oh, you told him because you are late, sorry. But the big man is getting older now, can't you judge? My brother said that man, you still have a long time left to go, you know. No, man, I'm 65, you know. Yeah, man, I ate that man, 65. Oh, but listen now, be careful, Monday morning, you know, Nola. When what? When you go, because you walk now, then later, just tell you about the trend for sun and you train.
