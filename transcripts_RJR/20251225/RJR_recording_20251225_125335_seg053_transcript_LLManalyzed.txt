20251225 125335 I'm safe in your arms You're my angel baby Every day is Christmas when you're by my side. Every day is Christmas, every day is Christmas. Every day is Christmastime when you're by my side. Oh, you're my love. You're the joy in my holiday sun. And when you you smile I can't breathe Can't believe that you're mine Set a body open for your love And use a gift tonight Loving you for all my life
