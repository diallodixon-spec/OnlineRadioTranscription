============================================================

How are you personally approaching this final stretch of the year? It feels like a doozy. I think everyone is under some kind of weather, whether it's the flu or hurricane Melissa impact or something is happening. But me myself, I'm in a reflective mode and I'm looking to start putting plans together for 2026. So, you know, I had some leaders who told me it's not over till the fat lady sings. I'm still holding on to that because I really do believe that great things are still in store for the next, what, two to three weeks before 2025 ends. Yeah, it is the reflective time. Yes. It's the time when we look back on some things that we didn't even remember that we said we were going to do for the year. We took up at the arm division board and was a lot of mercy. I wonder if we can still make it. Can we make it? What does entering the last few weeks mean for you spiritually and professionally?
