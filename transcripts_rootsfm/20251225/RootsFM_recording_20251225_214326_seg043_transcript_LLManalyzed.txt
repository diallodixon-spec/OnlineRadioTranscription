20251225 214326 No winter, no coat Much better diving in the water from the boat Play the music loud, somebody pass the remote Everybody singing on them kiaola note Rum a beat every weekend Slurp on me speech when me speaking Such a wonderful feeling All when Christmas gone I ain't leaving It's good to be hungry The lights are on the tree The presents are open I'm with the family. It's good to be home. The lights are on the tree.
