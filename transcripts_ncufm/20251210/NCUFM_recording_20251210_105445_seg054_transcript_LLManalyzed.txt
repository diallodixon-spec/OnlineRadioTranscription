You reign o'er the frong For you are God and God alone Because of you my cloudy days are gone And I can sing to you this song I just wanna say that I love you more than anything My heart, my mind, my soul belongs to you Who paid the price for me, oh yeah Way back on Calvary and yet I engraved you I lived you up and made me by your name
