20251219 111312 I'm not sure what happened just now with Rasta. Alright, let me... And I don't think we have time to squeeze in another one just before. I don't know, I don't. Hopefully we can get Rasta on later on and stuff. But I'm not quite sure the point that he was raising. But for me, let me tell you Rasta, that this is where we live. This is where we live and there are persons who talk about a physical repatriation and that is fine. There are some of us and of course that will be subject to the receptivity of the nations. So I know Ghana is amenable to it and I think Nigeria might be, if we can find a way of dividing ourselves. So what about those of us who are Ashanti and Igbo and all those things together, which of the places we go to. But even so, Ghana is pretty clear. The Ashanti tradition about not asking people where they're from and those other kinds of things.
