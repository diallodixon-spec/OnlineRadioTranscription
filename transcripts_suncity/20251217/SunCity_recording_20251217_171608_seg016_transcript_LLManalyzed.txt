20251217 171608 Christmas in the ghetto, love, you know that. Silver bells, silver bells. Soon it will be Christmas in the ghetto. Ring-a-ding-a-ding, tring-a-ling-a-ling, soon it will be Christmas time. Look at you, get your rockin'. Turn to you, the children sing. It's Christmas time in the ghetto. Look what you did, little one. Come on, rockin' Christmas time. Let me hear you sing it loud and clear. It's Christmas, silver bells.
