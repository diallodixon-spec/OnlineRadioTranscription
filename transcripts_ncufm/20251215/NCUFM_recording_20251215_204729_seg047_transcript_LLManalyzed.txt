20251215 204729 That's a word that will bless your heart I'll bring you more than a song For a song in itself is not what you have required You search much deeper within Through the way things appear You're looking into my heart I'm coming back to the heart of worship And it's all about you, all about you, Jesus. I'm sorry, Lord, for the thing I've made it. When it's all about You, all about You, Jesus.
