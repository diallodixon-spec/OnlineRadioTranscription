2025-12-12 09:30:26 The former US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen's admission that the US Treasury and the Fed made a big mistake by stressing that US inflation was transitory supports his view. At that time the Fed's dot plot or interest rate path indicated that the benchmark for the oil funds rate would have had to be hiked to between 5% per annum and 5.5% per annum during the year 2023 rather than to 2.5% to 2.75% per annum originally programmed for in order to correct this the fiscal year 2022 was $1.4 trillion compared with $2.8 trillion for the fiscal year 2021. Meanwhile, the Congressional Budget Office projected a deficit of $1.54 trillion in 2023 when this has been driven by the higher interest rate regime being pursued by the Fed, but it zipped to $2 trillion or 7.55% of GDP by the end of the fiscal year on September 30, 2023, but veiled to $1.8 trillion or 6.66% of GDP
