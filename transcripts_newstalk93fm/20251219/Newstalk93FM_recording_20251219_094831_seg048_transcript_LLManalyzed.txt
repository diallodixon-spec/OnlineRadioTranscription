20251219 094831 And it hurts my heart, still a heart for one and one for all Still I believe that love is everlasting How it gets so normal, how it's so comfortable for sleep Man, this God don't want to pick up the devil I know me, me no easy Time testing but I'm strong With love on my mind, love in my thoughts, carrying on Why nobody no believe in a love again? Because every love that lost Nobody no believe in a God again Seems our faith is lost Nobody no believe and it hurts more Turn the lights on
