20251229 121110 I got a problem, it's too many women I like you too It's too many women Too many, too many I like you too, too many It's too many woman I like you too Said I'm falling, falling, I'm falling As I lay my bed with my head to the ceiling Say I'm drowning alone and I'm lost in my feelings Somebody send me a sign cause you know that I need it Can't even come back to me cause you know you're my healing I said it's okay, it's not too bad
