20251212 195642 economic and social activities, the single most unifying force on the planet, coming from the honorable Portia Simpson Miller, former prime minister of Jamaica, who has a birthday today, born on December 12, 1949. Very good evening to you both. And that's today in sports history. That also brings the Friday edition to a close for the 12th of December. My name is Kate Miller. Floyd Wright is the producer of the show. Adrian Reed, the technical man. That's the team that was responsible for today's show. And on Monday, God's building, we will be back. I'd just like to thank all those who participated on the show today. Graeme Richards of Yardy Sports. Thank you very much, sir, for your Premier League expertise. Once again, all right, music is where we go now to take us on. Boris Gardner has an immortal Christmas song as well, and it's the meaning of Christmas.
