Assistant Commissioner of Police, Dr. Gary McKenzie, says the Jamaica Constabulary Force will be clamping down on drivers who block roadways, double park, or abandoned vehicles in town centers. He explained that these practices not only slow traffic, but also put pedestrians at risk by forcing them off sidewalks and into the road. Speaking at HMAIC Information Service think tank, Dr. McKenzie said vehicles found obstructing traffic will be ticketed and impounded, and owners will face prosecution before they can retrieve them. He stressed that enforcement is necessary to reduce congestion, prevent frustration that can lead to careless and dangerous driving. The assistant commissioner is encouraging motorists to make use of designated parking areas, carpool where possible, and take advantage of public transport operations during the season.
