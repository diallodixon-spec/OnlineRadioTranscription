20251222 152312 Let me talk about another type of caveat, the one that concerns people the most. Let us say, for example, I entered a sale agreement to buy a property from Jesse. Jesse is now getting a higher price from someone, and Jesse doesn't want to sell the property to me, he wants to sell it to someone else. You don't know Jesse would never do that. So I put out a caveat on the property. Someone else may see that property and say, all right, I'm going to take it, silly. They can do the transfer subject to caveat, but nobody would really want to do that because you don't know what my interest in the property is. I can come with a lawsuit and sue you or Jesse. So in a case like that, we're going to send a warning to me and if I don't respond, then my caveats will lapse. So there are certain caveats that are, should I say, harmless, like the JPS caveats
