20251229 205130 I want to know if I'm looking in the right direction Am I receiving your full attention? Or am I wasting my time? I wanna know Do you promise to love me deeply? Then never go away and leave me With just bitterness inside And I'm not ashamed For being so cautious For loving the game You know it ain't a game So if I gave my heart to you What would you do with it?
