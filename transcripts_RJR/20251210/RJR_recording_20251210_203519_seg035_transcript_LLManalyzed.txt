Well, I've got life and things nice step in the yet has them cast of you. Free up. Be yourself. Any shoe still can't work like you. Up, up, up, we're there. No bad mind can hold me down. While you sit down when you're cursing, have you ever got the blessing? And while you're there criticizing, have you ever learned a lesson? They made tough like a wall, you know? I couldn't follow people, got to be me. H.M. in my family, tell them to follow me. Me brother tell us why you married B.S.M.G. We can't fill up your whole country, so when you're still with your face, free up, be yourself.
