20251222 212218 I'm lonely. Every minute is an hour. Every day is a lonely lifetime. You're my noctine lover. Little time that we spend together just can't last forever. You're my no-die lover. Yeah. Everyone keep telling me that there's a man I'm meant to be, even though I need you not in there. Walk away if you see me coming, even though it's you I'm loving I want her I can't leave her I won't live without her
