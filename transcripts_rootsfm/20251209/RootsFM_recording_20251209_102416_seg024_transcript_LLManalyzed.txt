It's gonna be a bright, bright, bright sunshine in there. It's gonna be bright, bright, right sunshine in there. Yeah, it's gonna be bright. Bright, bright, bright, bright sunshine today. Say this morning I woke up and I look in the mirror and every part of my body was in place. Many people died and never saw this day. So another day I live I appreciate. Don't ever want to act too high and mighty cause tomorrow
