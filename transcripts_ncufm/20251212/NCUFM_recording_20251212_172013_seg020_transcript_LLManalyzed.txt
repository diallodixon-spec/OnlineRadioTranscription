20251212 172013 Lord of hosts, God who keeps us through the years, including twenty twenty-five. Thank you. Your love and care for your children are amazing, Lord. Again, we say thank you. Thanks for being our creator and savior and the lord of our lives. This evening, we look into your word once again, and we're encouraged by the promises you've made. Thank you for overcoming power, over trial and grief and pain, and oh yes, Lord, over sin. Thank you for Jesus Christ who overcame the devil and his temptations, who overcame death, and who gives us life, even life eternal. Father, please accept our praise and our worship. Please accept our serenade, which we offer up in Jesus name. Amen.
