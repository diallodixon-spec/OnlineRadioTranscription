20251222 130204 I have a lightning spirit Early in the morning I had it Me cooler ready, me ice done ready Me punching that's automatic I have a lightning jumbie A kind of energy inside me And it ready for the rum Ready ready for the rum, ready ready for the rum ready for the action A spiritual encounter In me soul taking over So let we go. Let we go down the road. Let we go. It's action time, here we go! Hands up! This vetting spirit of me feeling good!
