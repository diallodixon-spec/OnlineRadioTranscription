20251223 145138 I won't let a day go by. I'm keeping my mind, keeping it safe. Staying on Jesus, staying on Jesus. With every new sunrise, I've got to keep my mind Meditate on it Spirit deep within When the darkness covers me When the light grows strangely dim It's your power that anchors me For I keep your words deep within So what the day holds for me Won't make me run and hide
