20251218 091917 Call your boss if you're still in the traffic or if you're heading to work, if you should be there maybe by 10 o'clock, call your boss and let your boss know that you will be late, I promise you. All right, we are way past our break. We're gonna take a customs goods declaration known as an IM-4 or IMS-4. Ask your clearing agent to provide your customs declaration, customs assessment notice and customs receipt once duties and taxes are paid. Where your clearing agent may not be able to provide the IM-4 or IMS-4, request your customs goods declaration registration number or CNUMBER which can be used to verify your payments. Importers, request your IM-4, IMS-4 or CNUMBER
