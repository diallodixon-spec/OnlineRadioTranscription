20260102 090203 I've got to show the world All that I want to be And all my abilities There's so much more to me Somehow I'll have to make them Just understand I got it well in hand And oh, how I've planned I'm spreading love There is no need to fear And I just feel so good every time I hear it I'm coming up, I want the world to know, got to let it show I'm coming up I want the world you know Got to let it show
