This is my decision, decision This is my decision I don't think you listen, you listen I don't think, you listen For me to come out, it must mean I'm out the door It must mean I'm not the same, it must mean that I'm on your case For me to go out, it means that I'm not the door I want to show you my world Give me one break, I need faith
