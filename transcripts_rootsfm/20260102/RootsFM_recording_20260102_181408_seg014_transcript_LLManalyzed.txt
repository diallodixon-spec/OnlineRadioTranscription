20260102 181408 She wants a man to treat her right Not a man who wants to come in late at night She wants a good life No man to cause her pain and strife She's been a hidden doubt of loving And she says she must confess She's been and abused. But there's no more time to lose. Oh, no. Because she want a good life. No man to cause her pain and strife. She says she want a good live. No man to cost her pain and strifes. She don't want no unsteady relationship. One way rock like a rocking ship Born a life as steady as can be One that brings back memory She want a good life No one to cause her pain and strife
