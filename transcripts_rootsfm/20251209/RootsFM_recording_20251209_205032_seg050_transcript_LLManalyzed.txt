Back in the saddle looking for a little affection. I took a shot as a contestant on the love connection. The audience voted and you know they picked a winner. I took my date to the hill before Medina and some dinner. She had a few drinks. I'm thinking soon what I'll be getting. She said she started talking about plans for a wedding. I said wait, slow down love, not so fast as I'll be seeing you. That's why I found you don't play around with the funky, cold Medina. You know what I'm saying? That Medina's a monster, y'all. So keep going, Medina.
