20251217 102214 We have one desire to be glorified, to be lifted high. It's for you. We want you, Jesus. To be glorified. To be lifted high. We have one desire, to be glorified. You don't the glory. You'll be lifted high. May God touch your heart as we offer praise before God. Father, as our praises arise before you, it is our heart's desire that you would consume us with your presence to saturate our minds.
