20260101 133817 Lately, babe, I've been thinking How good it was when you were here And it ain't the wine that I've been drinking For once I feel my head is clear. I heard it this morning when I opened up my eyes. That I'd opened up the feeling, took me by surprise. I guess you meant more to me than I realized. The love we had stays on my mind.
