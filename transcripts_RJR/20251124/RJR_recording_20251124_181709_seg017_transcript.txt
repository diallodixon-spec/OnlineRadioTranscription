I was a literature student, so I perhaps would have more to say about film and the book itself, and how that song would have landed with me based on the specific themes, you know, and the kind of tension between hope and reality. That song kind of emphasized, that came out of the movie first, then both. So yeah, it's a kind of a love song. You are my rubber dub partner and the instrumentation of it is just amazing. But I'm going to cheat a little bit because I'm going to tell you my other favorite song and I only love it in this context. It is Many Rivers to Cross.
