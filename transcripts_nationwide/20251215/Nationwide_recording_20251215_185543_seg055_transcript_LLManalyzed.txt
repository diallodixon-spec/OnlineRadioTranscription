20251215 185543 I've called for rough level 350 members. So we're still short staff where that is concerned. And that explains a lot of the chaos we see. It could explain it. I mean, there are several factors that can pertain in terms of what chaos means. The breaking of the traffic rules, the engagement, how you vend. People just simply go and take up a spot and hope for the best. That is why I was saying that it's a series of complex issues because we do have persons who are desperately trying to eke out a living. But what they do is not in conformity with the law in all honesty. And so there is that challenge that we have to really confront and call it out for what it is. Do we tolerate it any further? No, we do not. We understand, however, that persons have a right to equal to living and so on.
