20251212 180101 Another chance I need to know your mercy Just give me the strength to change within I know I'm not all that I can be My weakness seems to get the best of me. But as long as you are here, I know that I will make it. Every step along the way, please hear my prayer. A heart like yours is my desire, a heart like yours is what I'm searching for. Full of compassion, nothing wrong with it. Please
