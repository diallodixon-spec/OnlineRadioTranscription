20251224 111108 Eboni survives. Eboni is free, free. From Kenya, Nigeria, Zimbabwe, Uganda, to the greater and the lesser Antilles. They took us from the motherland in shackles and chains to be slaves in the Caribbean world. We've been made new for a night. Rejoicing comes in the morning. Soon we'll be free. We are ebony. I am ebony. Ebony is strong. Ebony survives. Ebony is free. I'm ebony. Ebony is free. I am Ebony. Ebony is strong. Ebony survives. Ebony is free, free.
