20251224 135541 I see this fine girl from my party, she wear yellow Every other girl did they do too much but this girl mellow Now you might find situation I could use they tell I'm mellow Finally I find way to talk to the girl but she ain't no one follow Who you gonna phone phone one? Why you no one phone phone one? Then I start to feel a bum bum one But she give me small small one I know she said she's happy but sit down one one But she feelin' insecure Cause her friends go they got my life jingle Go they go my life jingle Yeah I know I look sharp but for you I can do no more And my hips make you cry when I'm movin' around you Do it once, do it twice I push back, you hold me tight Get a taste for a night Baby show me you can calm down, calm down Dance with me and take a lead now, lead now
