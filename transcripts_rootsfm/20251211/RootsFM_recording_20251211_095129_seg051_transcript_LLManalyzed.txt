Jesus Christ was born on Christmas Day. The angels sing a king was born today and man will live forevermore because of Christmas Day. Mary's boy child, Jesus Christ, was born on Christmas Day. Our shepherds watch, they flock by night, they see a bright new shining star. They hear a choir sing a song. The music seemed to come from afar. Heart now hears the angels sing.
