Without apology, without apology I beg you, try to hold you off if you're not one of we Nobody wanna be themself, they want me wanna be It's like you don't forget to make one of you and one of me Why they want to modify and alter them and not admit them under the influence of sinfulness and vanity Less leaders but follow rise of the majority It's Inside the world lose them sanity Follow me without apology, without apology Me pick up on a little trend me start fi bother me No man know how fi look a work an earn a salary dem rather fi Teeth and pick a leaf a for the dollar tree Just fi wear a jod and desert a roll a wallaby Body in a riches but the mind still in a poverty Nah breathe properly, house land property Wealth it pass down to them family Liar and thief, they want some friends Won't get no clean with this object Biggie walk in cause it's dirty, yeah
