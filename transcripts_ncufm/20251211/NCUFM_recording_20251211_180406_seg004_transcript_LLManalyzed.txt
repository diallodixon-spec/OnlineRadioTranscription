2025-12-12 11:00:28 events following an Olympic summit in Switzerland, proposing that both nation's athletes be reinstated for team and individual youth events, ahead of the 2026 Youth Olympic Games in Dakar. Russian and Belarusian athletes were originally banned in February 22 following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, but the debate around their participation has intensified in recent months. The IOC's latest recommendation follows the court of arbitration for sport overturning a ban, and allowing nine athletes from the two countries to compete as neutrals in qualifying events for next year's Winter Olympics. The proposal will now move to discussions with the various international federations, which must decide how and when reinstatement would take place. And that concludes our sports report and our newscast at this time. On behalf of the News, Sports and Current Affairs Department, I'm Dawson Ho Seng. News next in the morning during First Light.
