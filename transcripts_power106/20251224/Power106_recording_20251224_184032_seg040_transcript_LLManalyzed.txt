20251224 184032 students in the States that we know are graduated at a very high level and was offered a scholarship at probably three different universities to do law. So, you know, we believe that we have done thus far, even without the mentorship program, as we have done a long way in being a motivational factor to these students that are now in the program. So, you know, we are going to put together a real full-fledged Where Are You Now program as well to share, you know, with everybody. I'd like to be the first to receive that because I can talk about the contribution that we are making now. The contribution that we are likely to make in terms of giving back. Sure, that's going to be part of their lives going forward.
