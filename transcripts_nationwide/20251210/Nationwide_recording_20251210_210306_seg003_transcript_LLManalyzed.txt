I've been in a fantastic mood. It's my birth month, it's also Christmas, it's the end of the year. I'm grateful that this year has come to an end. I hated this year. For persons who get within this time, if you struggle with your mental health like I do, sometimes we get in this funk of overthinking, you know, about whether or not we've accomplished all we would have wanted to for the year, but what can accomplish. So what I do as a counter for that, cause I was sleeping, well, you know, going back into depression, really, truly what I do is just try to get myself, you know, that funk so chaos is around when i love it yeah totally uh also i lost an aunt last week friday my father sister died um i only have one auntie left on my father's side
