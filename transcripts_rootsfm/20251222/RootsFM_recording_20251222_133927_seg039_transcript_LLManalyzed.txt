20251222 133927 I need you, oh yes Say it loud and clear Baby I love you I just can't live without you Wanna know, yes? When my heart was broken in two You knew exactly what you should do You lift me up When I was down You turned your eyes There's no other woman In this world Quite like you know You forever bring me joy I couldn't take you for more time
