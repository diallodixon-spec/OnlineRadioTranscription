20251212 163320 The man that looked at me wrong If anyone called me, honey It was standing in the bathroom White teeth, they were saying that skirt don't fit me And I cried the whole way home But when you touch my face We define all of those blues When you say, because I'm the one you want. Winter, green kiss, all mine. You give a different meaning, because you mean it when you talk. Honey, I'm home. We could play house. Wake up, bed down. Pick me up. Who's the baddest in the land? What's the plan? What's the plan? You could be my forever nightstand, honey. When anyone called me, sweetheart, it was passive aggressive at the bar. And the chick was telling me to back off because a man had looked at me.
