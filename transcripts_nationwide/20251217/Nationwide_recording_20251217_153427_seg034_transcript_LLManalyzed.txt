20251217 153427 I want to keep you warm and kind Someone like you, needs someone like me That's the good life Let's stay on the beach, but stand on your feet Good life Life's too short, let's make it sweet Give me the good life And that's all we need, you plus me That's how good and I, good and I Sweet, sweet like honey, like honey Don't be fooled, it could get spicy We could connect, but what would that mean for me? Cause it could get dark, it could get ugly You look like the guy that only wants money But tell me, can you capture more of my desire? Can you handle my disaster?
