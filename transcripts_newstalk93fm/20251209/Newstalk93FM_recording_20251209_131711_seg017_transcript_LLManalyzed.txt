How to believe I was the queen that I meant to be I lived too long, tried to play both sides But I couldn't find my own place Caught a phallic child, cause I got too wild But now that's how I'm getting paid Cause that's she on stage I'm done hiding, now I'm shining like I wanna be We dreaming hard, we came so far, now I believe We're going up, up, up, it's our moment You know together we're glowing Gonna be, gonna be golden Hop, hop, hop with our voices Going to get you so warm that Gonna be gonna be golden Oh, I'm done hiding Now I'm shining like a butterfly
