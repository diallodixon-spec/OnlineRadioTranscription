Alvin! Good. I know and I'm happy that you're on. What's on your mind today? It was so good to see you the other day. What happened, you know, is not what is on my mind. It's how to come out and talk. I just don't reach out and what I go by, just come out and swear. I was questioned and asked if I want to.
