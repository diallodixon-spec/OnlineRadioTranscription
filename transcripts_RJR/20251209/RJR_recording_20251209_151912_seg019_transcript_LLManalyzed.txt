Oh, John never let me down. Never let them take me down. No, blessings fall on me, yeah. Blessings fall on me. John, never let me down, never let them get me down. I'm a fighter for sure. You're slight, and I see the life you're before. Deja vu, I see the highs and the lows Sleep or dead, me say your eyes are for clothes No doubt on my toes, are the price on my clothes Me a spend more money than timing of the store No gamble me life, but the dice are for roll Man on ice from the floor, could you wipe on the floor? Blessings fall on fall on me Blessings fall on me So don't ever let me down Don't ever let them take me down, no
