You're gonna go into hell You know you're gonna go in Hell, they dissin' Now our shepherds kept their watchers Over silent blocks by night Behold, throughout the heavens, there shone a holy light Now the shepherds feared and trembled with love of the earth rang out an angel chorus, that held the stage aside. No more waiting, chillin' on the mountain. It's over, over, over.
