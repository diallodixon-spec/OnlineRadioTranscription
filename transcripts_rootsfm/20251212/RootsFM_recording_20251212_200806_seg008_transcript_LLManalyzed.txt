20251212 200806 So just hold me, baby, like I wanted to from the day that I met you. Hold me, baby, real tight. The fantasy will fill by the end of the night. Hold me baby, like I want it to from the day when I met you, hold me tonight. I want to come and warm your lonely nights. I want to be wrapped up, baby, in your arms arms And I'm holding you so tight I wanna rock you gently till you sleep I wanna be the man that's in your dreams I would be glad just to know that you feel the way I feel
