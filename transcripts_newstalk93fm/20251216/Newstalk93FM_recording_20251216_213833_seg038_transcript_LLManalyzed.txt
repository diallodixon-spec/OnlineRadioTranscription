20251216 213833 It feels good to love somebody and somebody loves you back But it feels one sided now It feels one sided now You don't have to return about it cause it's crystal glad now now Guess it's bye to the good times I'll be gone by the sunrise I'll be better on my own I'll be better on my own, nah, nah Nobody should call my phone, nah, nah This is my last heartbreak song, nah, nah I'll be good on my own Nah, nah Why are you so quick to leave? When we both can make it worse When I'm gonna make you nervous if you hurt me I deserve I've been acting foolishly Forgetting what you used to love
