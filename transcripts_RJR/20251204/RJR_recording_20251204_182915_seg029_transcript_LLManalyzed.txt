============================================================

I finished this diploma, finished the courses, because after I finished this semester, then I would have had my practicum to do, and I don't need to be at Michael to do the practicum. So I get my tailor to make some big clothes, you know, so you could actually see the summer camp. Because I was too small for him, it wasn't really showing. But, you know, of course, there was a keeping distance. You might say to a friend and a friend that you met your friend might not be your friend alone They might share the information with somebody. So one evening I was on the hospital and I was sitting in my room and while I was there sitting down They came and they knocked the door and I realized I think it was Miss Titus at the time and she came in and said hello said, hi. They want to have a word with you. I hear something. I said, how's you? Because I'm normally friendly. I'm coming from country. So when I'm coming from a country for a young banana, I always bring it and share it with people. So that's me. I'm a giver.
