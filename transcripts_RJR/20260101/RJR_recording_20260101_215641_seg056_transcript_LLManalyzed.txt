20260101 215641 I'm not afraid of feelings that's tied to me teeth I'm in the trap some boy cause dem be posin' me dream. I'm not buying your people, I'm not growin' your people. I'm not wantin' your links, cause I know what you want. You can't buy a swift, much less see by your dreams. Heaven won't be buggered. I'm a part of the talk, so I'm a man and I'm a tool to help you. I'm the one right now. When they keep us all in the drama, when they markle up themselves and keep it coming, I'll be like monkey and kangaroo, I'm a monkey and kangaroo come for you. When you've got them in the dissonant and turning farmer, money and steel when they think you're the gunner.
