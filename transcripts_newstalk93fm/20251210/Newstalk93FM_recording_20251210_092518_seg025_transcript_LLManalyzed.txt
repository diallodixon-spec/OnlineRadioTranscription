out is it that Mrs. Williams, Minister Williams will be better served in a different capacity than at the Ministry of Finance because trust me it's a tough job you know and I can tell you that yesterday when I look at Damien Crawford coming at the minister putting question after question after question, you know. And the minister was really and truly at a loss, couldn't answer in the mean, you know, she referred that, for example, Daryl Valls should come and answer some question when they ask about the GPS and the money and so on. Minister, it is your job to answer. We're talking about money, we're talking about 150 million US dollars that is coming out of the consolidated fund to lend to JPS.
