We say Jah, bless the eye Oh Rastaman say Jah bless the Eye But I worry for sorrow and I worry for pain The eczema be breaking out of all the pain Seems like nothing ever gonna change Everything going on same way We can't get a fine cent, not even a one cent We can't get no money just to pay our rent So Jack bless you, Rastaman Jack bless you I say Jack bless the eye, poor R five cent will do And if you don't have five cents, then a rasta will suit you
