20251212 201310 My school bazaar I used to go But since I was introduced The barker now they say I loose When I drop it hot and I whine it On top the speaker box and I grind it And I don't want to stop and they call me Lose it I loose it on Lose it I sweet it on She say this gonna be hard Let's go down loose Hey, get loose away Get loose, get loose away, get loose Get loose away Lose on your way, kill them with your pace There's no place I'd rather be than in a place having a time the bark and all inside of me When I come on the stage gettin' a bag you know I lose When I drop it hot and I whine it Untop the speaker box and I grind it And I don't want to stop and they call me lose it
