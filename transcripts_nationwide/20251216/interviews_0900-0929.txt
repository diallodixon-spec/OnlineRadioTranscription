Title: Immigration Mondays: Updates and Q&A with Nadine Mahabir and Opa Lee

In a recent episode of "Immigration Mondays" on Nationwide 90 FM, host Nora Gay Banton was joined by Canadian immigration consultant Nadine Mahabir and U.S. Immigration Attorney Opa Lee. The discussion focused on updates and Q&A related to immigration matters concerning the United States and Canada.

Nadine Mahabir provided an update on Immigration Canada's recent express entry draws, specifically for the Canadian Experience Class category and the healthcare sector. She emphasized the importance of submitting all required information, including work experience, to increase the chances of selection.

Opa Lee discussed the new "gold card" program introduced by President Trump, which allows individuals with extraordinary abilities or exceptional abilities to apply for residency in the United States for a fee of $15,000. However, she noted that the processing time may not be as quick as expected, as applicants will still need to wait for a visa number to become available.

The hosts also addressed questions from listeners, including one about reapplying for a Canadian visa after a denial. Nadine Mahabir advised that it is possible to reapply the next day, but it's essential to understand the reasons for the refusal and ensure that all supporting documents are submitted.

Another question concerned the legitimacy of an email from "Immigration Express Canada" asking for a resume. Nadine Mahabir warned that this could be a scam, as Immigration Canada typically communicates through official channels, and individuals should be cautious when receiving unsolicited emails.

The conversation also touched on the topic of bringing a spouse from Jamaica to the United States, but unfortunately, Opa Lee's connection was lost, and the question was not fully addressed.

Overall, the discussion provided valuable insights and updates on immigration-related matters, and the hosts emphasized the importance of being informed and cautious when navigating the complex process of immigration.
