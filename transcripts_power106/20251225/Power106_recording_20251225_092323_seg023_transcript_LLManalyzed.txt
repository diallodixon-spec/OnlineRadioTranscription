20251225 092323 On the streets there's children laughing People smile as they are passing Christmas time is here Awaiting is done Wishing it could last forever Not just 12 days in December Through the year Let's try to remember that special way That everyone feels It's the magic of Christmas Day. Oh, and God bless us, everyone. The good and the bad, the happy, the sad, oh, and God, bless us.
