20251219 155530 We rock and groove. Them say, oh, yes, I show off. Oh, yes, I hype. Do you have liquor up your neck and all your life? No, you used to so fight that day, all night. Oh, some of myself after the rest of my life. Ooh, show up. Make sure you grow up. Live a good life, step to keep up. I'm good, so me please, I'm a lay back. Me see the trouble, me I leave that.. In my shoes, I'm gonna tank top. In my jeans, I'm gonna cut off my foot. In my shoes is some bright color socks, tight mat, but I'm not gonna wear no flip flops. Cause you're not gonna guess how I move. I just walk in the mood come make me rock and groove. No, no, I'm in some mood. Just how I can go through, come make we rock and groove. Rock and groove.
