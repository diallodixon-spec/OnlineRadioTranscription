2025-12-11 21:44:21 Live this life without you, even though I don't tell you all the times You hit my heart a long, long time ago In case you didn't know You got all of me I belong to you Yeah, you own my everything. In case you didn't know, baby, I'm crazy about you. And I would be lying if I said that I could live this life without you, even though I don't tell you all. And keep it locked on on a Thursday afternoon.
