20251216 125743 Well, here comes the musical thing, and love is all I bring. Come on, Capri, let me do the lyrical sling like King David. And rhythm like this, we not play with love. A long time on the DJ in a dance, a long time on the chant in a dance, I come from nice up here, yeah. I come from nice-up Jamaica Jamaica. I watch a drek. Dancers say love. Dancers took off. Liquors say love. Georgie Wines say love. People really see it and have to laugh. Oh, Lord. Promoters on the side, you have to laugh. How them laugh? Chalalalalalal champion. Watch me chop up the rhythm.
