Welcome to Public Opinion. I'm Robi-Ann Williams. A special good evening to our friends on our YouTube platform. Thank you so much for tuning in. We ask you to weigh in live in the comments section on today's public opinion. Today we turn our attention to a news story coming out of Clarendon. The Constabulary Communication Network issued a missing child alert on Tuesday afternoon with a picture of a six-year-old in her uniform. It quickly made the rounds on social media and in community WhatsApp groups. Now, Councillor CN Barnswell and his wife who were traveling from Maypen with their child saw the picture in their neighborhood watch group. Our new center is in receipt of a voice note in which Mrs. Barnswell recounts the moments leading up to the interception.
