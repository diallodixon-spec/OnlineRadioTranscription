============================================================

your life fall down. One by one, two by two, three by three. Watch them flee. One by one. Two by two. Three by three. They have to flee. If God be for us, we will be victorious. Watch the giants in your life fall down. No test, no testimony. If you come here you cross, you can't wear a crown.
