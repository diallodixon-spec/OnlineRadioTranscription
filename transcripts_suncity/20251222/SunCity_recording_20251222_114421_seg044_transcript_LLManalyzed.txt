20251222 114421 question. Now, the reason why Home Choice actually developed sorrel extract is just to solve a simple problem. Jamaicans love sorrel. We do. We love our sorrel. Now, traditionally, buying sorrel, actually, the raw materials to get sorrel, sugar, spices, it takes a lot of time and it costs a lot. We have a campaign that is all about saving you time in the kitchen. And that's what 100 Trust is all about. With our sorrel extract, you're getting that same authentic sorrel flavor taste with all natural spice because it's spiced already. Zero sugar for you to enjoy. All you have to do is pull, pour, swing and enjoy. All right. So let me get this right. Let me just break it down in layman's terms yeah it's the same way my mother would go to the market buy the story yeah see if it overnight as i go take our extra amount of time to get that flavor always nice and everything and i have to wait you have to wait on it correct home choice i've done that process and you guys have it ready and available we'll simplify that process
