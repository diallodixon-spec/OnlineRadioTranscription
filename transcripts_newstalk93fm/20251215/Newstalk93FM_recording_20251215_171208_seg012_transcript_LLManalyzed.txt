20251215 171208 So don't you ever Let me down again Cause I'm depending on you So you better come through this time Please hear my cry and if I ever Let you down my friend It was a misunderstanding So if I took you for granted Then I promised from today. I go jump like I never jump, wave like I never wave, wind like I never wind before. Just to show you a summer, a summer, and I need you back in my life. You got people by the truck, emotions running high. We are not in the sky, tears running down we eyes. Can't you tell that we started, we started, and we need you back and we lie, I need you back, I'm back home. Come home to me, come home to me,
