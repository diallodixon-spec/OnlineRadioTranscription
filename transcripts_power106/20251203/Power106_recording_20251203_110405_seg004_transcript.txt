Let me line up some clips from the parliament just in case people weren't listening. So I'll start off with the Prime Minister, Dr. Andrew Hones, describing as unprecedented the 6.7 billion of international financial support mobilized for Jamaica, obviously, after the impact of Hurricane Melissa. Prime Minister said it was indicative of the government's handling of the economy. The swift and coordinated response is a vote of confidence in the administration of the affairs of Jamaica. Madam Speaker, Jamaica today stands as a credible, responsible and trustworthy sovereign state.
