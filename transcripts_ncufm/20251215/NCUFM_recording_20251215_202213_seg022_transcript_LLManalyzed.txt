20251215 202213 I'm still here I may not have money I may not have fame But Lord, I'm still here Nobody's gonna move me, Lord I'm still here There are times when I feel this courage To the point where I just feel like giving up I'm still holding on, Lord His presence is here now. In my prayer time, the Lord gave me this song and told me to share it with the world.
