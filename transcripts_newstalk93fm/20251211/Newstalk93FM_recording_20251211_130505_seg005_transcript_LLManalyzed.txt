I say, I say, oh, yo. So let me see your hands up in the air Wave them up in the band People from everywhere Welcome up to the land of the party Fill up the party Cause life is to be living, to be living it And thanks is to be given, to be given it So don't be late, the truck heaven can't wait We are team to celebrate, I'm telling you Hard work without the smart work It's not work, we don't want no batter than you
