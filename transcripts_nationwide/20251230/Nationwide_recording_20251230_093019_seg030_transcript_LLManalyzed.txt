Yes. the office and and but but they should be able to look on the system to see your your your payment history so this should be able to go on the computer to see that you put $1,500 every week and on Friday this is what is left and then you go again and you top up $1,500 again on Saturdays so maybe I'm trying to figure out what to tell you.
