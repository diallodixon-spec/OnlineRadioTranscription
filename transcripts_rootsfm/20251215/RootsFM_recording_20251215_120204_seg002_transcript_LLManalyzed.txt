20251215 120204 Good afternoon, my people. Good afternoon. I'm sure the Lord will fix it for us. This is Route 96.1, the voice of the inner city, and today special prayer for my friend, Sidani Gray Griffith. I thank you. God bless you, God bless you, sister Patricia, God bless you. God bless you. We give God thanks for another day, we give God thanks for love. It is Christmas. We are moving into the Christmas season and it is a season of love. So today I greet all the Roots of Family and all those on WhatsApp.
