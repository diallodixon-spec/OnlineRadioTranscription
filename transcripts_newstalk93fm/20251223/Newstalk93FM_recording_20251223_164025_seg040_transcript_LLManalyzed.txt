20251223 164025 I've been patient, and I've been patient and I've been waiting Call me stubborn, but I can't get over it You left and never say goodbye Those tears I cried No, I can't get over it So don't you ever let me down again Cause I'm depending on you So you better come through this time Please hear my cry
