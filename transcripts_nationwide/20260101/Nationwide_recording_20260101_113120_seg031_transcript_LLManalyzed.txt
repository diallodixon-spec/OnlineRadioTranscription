20260101 113120 And never to part Together forever we two And don't you know I would move destiny holding A power I just can't deny It's never changing Can't you hear me? I'm saying I want you for the rest of my life Together forever and ever to pass Together forever we two And don't you know I would move heaven and earth to be together forever
