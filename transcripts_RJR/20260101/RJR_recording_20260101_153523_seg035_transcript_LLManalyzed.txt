20260101 153523 We were in town. So Ken and I said, you know man, he's going to give us one. He came by the day to the concert and I tell him I'll pop it in a string and mash up the place. And he said, so when Ken come on and string up and start playing, me and Willie Williams, you know Willie Williams? We were singing Armageddon. So really, I'm so happy. See, I hate this, you know. I'm joking. It's all this school thing. Music, man, go for it. Love it. I'm saying, yeah, man, that's what I'm talking about. Things that I would know from them teachers, I don't think they're going to tell you about. They might, we love them, but we have to move on. And I don't think so. But what we used to do, you know, at lunchtime we used to go to this place where they'd lunch. And sometimes we'd take lunch money and punch to tune them, like King Booth, Baba Nde, Deva, and so on.
