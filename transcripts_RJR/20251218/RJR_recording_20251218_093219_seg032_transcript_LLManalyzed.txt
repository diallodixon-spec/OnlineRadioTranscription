20251218 093219 Bill Express, a proud member of the Grace Kennedy Financial Group. You're now listening to Emily Shields Talk With Substance on Hotline. Radio Jamaica, active for the good of our nation. See how I interrupted the interview to say hi to Ricky and my schoolmate just came in but I'm just rejoining to get a little in before I go to this interview. Mrs. Leslie, little parish manager. Yes, Mrs. Leslie. You're telling me about the team that is here today. That's correct. And I was reminding us that we will have Breaking Healthcare Barriers, which is a international volunteer group. They will come with a number of doctors.
