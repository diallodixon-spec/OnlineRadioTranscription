20251226 162616 I don't have a name, nothing when I'm cooking, I can't keep to see me all the while when I come in and run in. Shut all the windows off the my internet name. Full count of the party, well, mad at me. Nothing personal, just how we let off steam. Now I'm telling you, the pain of the fight, all the hate, all the lies, don't mean a thing, I do what I love. Don't touch me any of that time, never seen any of that rhyme. Cuck me now, you put the rest in my blood. Ready up, I get laid, and I'm on my way. Check me in, I eat what I love. All of me life experiences, do. I don't. I don't I don't know, I don't know. I don't know what to do.
