20251231 193933 I'm careful and very wanted to care for them, but I don't think that always translates into how we generally treat our children. So even outside of like sexual abuse and those sorts of things, or even think about like corporal punishment and those sorts of also associated issues, we don't really see children as people sometimes that are, you know, we want to protect them, but then we are also doing things that are vis-a-vis not protecting them from harm. It's not centering them. We don't often as a society act in their best interest and put their best interest forward. And that can be seen from the top down. It can be seen from parenting techniques. It can be see by what it is that our legislators choose to prioritize. It can be seeing in the schools, and those are the things. And so justice might look different for the individual child. And when we even stretch it further to think about the children who are most vulnerable and who are most at harm, their justice, of course, looks different.
