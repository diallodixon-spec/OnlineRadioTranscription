============================================================

I don't play football, I've touched down everywhere Everywhere, everywhere I don't play baseball, but I've hit a home run Everywhere, everywhere I've been to countries and cities I can't pronounce And the places on the globe, I ain't no existing. In Romania, she pulled me to the side and told me, bitch, you can have me and my sister. In Lebanon, yeah, the women are bomb. And in Greece, you guessed it, the women ain't sweet. Been all around the world, but I ain't gonna lie. There's nothing like Miami's heat. You're listening to Sleek Radio, 93 FM.
