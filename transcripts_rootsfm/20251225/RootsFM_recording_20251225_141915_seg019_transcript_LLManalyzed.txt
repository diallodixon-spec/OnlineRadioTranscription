20251225 141915 that we all have been hoping to see. It's a day that we all have imagined. Here it is. How you felt so far. Let me use this opportunity on behalf of the members and staff of the Roots 96.1 FM to say a very Merry Christmas to you. Our dear listeners, all who have been listening to this wonderful inner city radio station for the past years, we just want to say a big thank you. We want to thank you for all that you've been doing to encourage us along the way. My name is Dwight
