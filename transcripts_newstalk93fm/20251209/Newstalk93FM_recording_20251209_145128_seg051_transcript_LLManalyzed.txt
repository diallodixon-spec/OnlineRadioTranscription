I know you want it when you callin' my name It's gettin' naughty, girl, you bustin' my brain I'ma show you what I made up Come on let me blow me blow me blow I've been happy on my sofa When I look into your eyes Girl is you giving me a sign When you gonna realize I'm tryna make you my wife I like the things you do Girl I'll be to make you my wife. I like the things you do. Girl, I'll be good for you. I think I'm made for you. Girl, hold me down, always. I like the thing you do.
