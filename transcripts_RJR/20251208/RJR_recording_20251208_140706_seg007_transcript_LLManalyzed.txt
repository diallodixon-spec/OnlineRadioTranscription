============================================================

Nothing in life is free. That's why I'm asking you, what can you do for me? I've got responsibility. So I'm looking for a man who's got some money in his hand. Cause nothing from nothing, nothing, nothing leaves. Nothing, nothing, nothing. You've got to have something if you want to be with me, ain't nothing going on with the rents. You got to have a J-O-V if you wanna be with me. No romance with the finance, I said no romance with the finance.
