20251217 161811 Let me fall in love I tried to say I love you But the words won't come true In my life I see all the tears and sad memories But why can't I thought of you And you feel the feelings too Far behind I feel all the tears in this sovereignty. Around these winter blows, I'm thinking back in time. And there will be that rainbow's end. If I could follow on, then lose no mind. As it's only lonely in me again. Lonely won't leave me alone. Lonely will leave me alone. Why tell me why? Lonely won't let me go.
