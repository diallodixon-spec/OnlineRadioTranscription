20251215 133026 condolences are out to you. And we're asking, I mean, for example, Black River, when I saw how the courthouse has been demolished and therefore those persons who are in the legal system, our thoughts and prayers are with you. And for those who do the contribution, the contribution will continue as best as possible. But as I said, we know we have limited resources. I'm not a technocrat, and I'm certainly not anyone of significance who can say to the government, you know, put some money, but wherever funding can be found, and again, that is only through advocacy, we would ask that the fundings be placed in our infrastructure, in our human resource. Thank you so much. That was Anne-Marie Furtado-Richards. She is an attorney at law and the chairperson of the Criminal Practice Committee of the Jamaica Bar Association. We take the break. Alright, I can exit the platform now? Yes.
