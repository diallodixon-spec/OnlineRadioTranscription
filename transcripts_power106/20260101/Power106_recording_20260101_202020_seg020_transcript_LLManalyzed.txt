20260101 202020 Go away from my window. Leave at your own chosen speed. I'm not the one you want, baby. I am not the one you need. You say you're looking for someone who's never weak but always strong To protect you and defend you Whether you were right or wrong To open each and every door But it ain't me, babe Oh no, no, it ain't hey. It ain't me you're looking for, babe. Go lightly from the ledge, dear. Go lightly on the ground.
