20260102 185839 I saw you around, your lips inhaled, and I said I knew right there you were the one. I was caught up in physical attraction, but to my satisfaction, maybe you're more than just a friend. And if I ever fall in love again, I will be sure that the lead is just like you. If there's anything I could be wanting to leave, promise you'll never leave me lonely. I just want to be the one you need.
