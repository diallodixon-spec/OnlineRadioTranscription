And Baby Sham now is an artist, well, lyrical too. So, because he took a calabar, he knows how to put words together, you know. So, we all just sketched that little vibes there, to put lyrics together. Yeah, man. So, how would you describe your style of music now, and makes you stand out? What makes you stand out from other artists? I need more versatility. Like, I would DJ, sing, you know, all type of things. Rap, because I'm full of lyrics, you know. Yeah, yeah. Lyrics in no other way. Yeah, so I've got all different genres of music. I do all R&B, roots reggae, one drop, everything. So I don't limit myself. So Tuff Art is not an artist where you just say, listen Tuff Art, that type of music they sing. Tuff Art sings all type of music. All type of music.
