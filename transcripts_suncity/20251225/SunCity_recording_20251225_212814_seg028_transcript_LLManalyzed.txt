20251225 212814 Here I sit Trying not to cry Asking myself why You do this to me, no, baby Such a night around for me to tell you, baby, face to face I'm writing you this letter And this is what I had to say All I really wanted was some of your time Instead you told me lies when someone else was on your mind What you do to me Look what you did to me I thought that you were someone who would do me right Until you broke my emotions and you made me cry What you did to me Can't take what you did to me Now I see that you've been doing wrong
