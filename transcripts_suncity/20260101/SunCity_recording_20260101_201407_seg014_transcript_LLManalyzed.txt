See I don't wanna hug my pillow late at night no more I'm tossing and turning and thinking about burning down these walls I don't wanna feel this fire no more no more no more See I'm made of my mind cause I'm wasting my time Ain't nothing here to keep me warm And over and over I try And over and over you lie And over and over I cry
