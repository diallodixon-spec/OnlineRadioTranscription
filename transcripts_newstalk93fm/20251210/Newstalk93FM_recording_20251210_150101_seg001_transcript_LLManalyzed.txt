Come out and wave with me, come out and rave with me. You can spend the day with me. Wave with me, wave with me. Come out, and wave with me. All right, come here we go. Wheels up, come let me go. Now round and round like merry-go-round. All dance and every show. Clothes white like Pettico. In my archipelago. With red vibe, it's all right. Just hold on and hold tight. We're going in on a full flight. Look left and look right. Now you see what we look like. It's a celebration celebration So throw your hands up in the air
