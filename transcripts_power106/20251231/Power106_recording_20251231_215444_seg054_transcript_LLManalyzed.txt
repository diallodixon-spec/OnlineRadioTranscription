20251231 215444 Love that's really pure and true Don't you know that you're my guiding light When I've got you, everything is right You're my feelings, then stronger more than before And if we could lie, I'd you to know that if I could fly I'd pick you up, I'd take you into the night And show you love like you'll never never never never never fly
