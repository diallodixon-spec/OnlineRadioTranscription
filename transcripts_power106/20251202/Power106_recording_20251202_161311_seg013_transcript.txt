Alright so that one produced by Grub Cooper and it is our contribution to bringing joy at Christmas time so we do hope that as we go through this period that you are reflecting on what it is that you have and if you have a lot share with others you have been blessed so you can be a blessing to others because even those who have little they are thinking about others around them who have nothing so we really want to encourage you over this Christmas period which I know is going to be busy there's going to be a lot of commercial activity certainly in this part of the island that you remember while you're shopping don't shop until you drop
