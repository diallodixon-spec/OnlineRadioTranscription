20251226 184230 You've got some kids to attend to I've got to find me myself a woman What I wouldn't do now When you reach home, you're greeted with hugs and kisses By your wife and your three lovely kids Just to see your dinner on the table Ain't got nothing to worry about, you got your cable Still got a young one coming up in the cradle Damn, man your life must be so stable as for me I'm a neighbor, disabled I'm like a fable, a fear You've got a woman to go home to I've got to find me myself a woman Water wouldn't be enough
