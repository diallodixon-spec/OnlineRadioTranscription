20260102 144228 I said five in the morning. I wake up to five for my yarns. Fear in my mind is a warning. Pray to the one you're relying. I've been wandering all day I tried to be fine but I can't be The noise in my mind wouldn't leave me I tried to get by but I'm burning And behind my mind it runs All these thoughts of troubling Fighting to give up my pain Fighting been Fighting to be on my lane My mind, running to the other side When it's time to leave my life Then it tries to pick me up Tell you what I need, riot I really need, I really need time now
