20251223 115426 I don't know if it's worth it I wanna look through it but we are set free Confused with these thoughts, you know? Don't go wrong I don't do life if it's love, nah but Heavy heart if we make it, make it strong Pain make them not pre-tax normal cards Them say high glue, high glue Mixed rum and bum, then the Bible read People are shaking, I'm not frightened, I'm. They all are like Saint Lysa. Wonder if smile ever hurt me. Love not look down here, we are set free. Wonder if every cry worth it. Why not look to me but we are set free?
