============================================================

Why so sexy, you're so dumb And I'll survive the earth so long If I'm not there, it won't get done. I choose to blame your moment. Child, why you always come running on me? It's my life. Won't you let an innocent woman be? Never hurt yourself, care. Half your brain just ain't fair. Let you out, while you always come running.
