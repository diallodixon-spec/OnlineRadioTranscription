20251223 140407 completed 25 of 34 passes for 295 yards, becoming the first 49ers quarterback since Joe Montana in 1990 to throw five touchdowns in a single game. His performance extended San Francisco's winning streak to five. Running back Christian McCaffrey caught two touchdown passes, while Purdy also connected with Demarcus Robinson, George Kittle and Joanne Jennings. San Francisco led 24-17 at halftime and pulled away in the second half, sealing the win when linebacker Dee Wint has returned a late interception 74 yards for a touchdown. The 49ers now face the Chicago Bears and division leaders Seattle Seahawks, knowing two wins will clinch the NFC West title and home field advantage in the playoffs. For Indianapolis, a fifth straight loss ends their AFC South title hopes, though a wild-card spot remains possible. The result also confirmed post-season berths for the Buffalo Bills.
