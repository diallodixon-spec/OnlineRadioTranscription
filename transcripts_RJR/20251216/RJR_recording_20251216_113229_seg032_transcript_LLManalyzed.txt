20251216 113229 Trans Jamaica Highway is having its hurricane relief program and Trans Jam publicly owned and giving back. I really like it. So I know it's an awesome task. I see a whole heap of lumber, whole heap of zinc, whole heap of some, right, here and being distributed. And by the way, if your name is on the verified list of the Ministry of Labour and Social Security, you can turn up. If your name is not on the list, go to the ministry, get registered. They will do the check. And as long as you're qualified, you're going to get assistance. I can't tell you how much you'll get, but you're going get some, depending on your need. I have with me Colin Murray, who's the chief operating officer at TransJam
