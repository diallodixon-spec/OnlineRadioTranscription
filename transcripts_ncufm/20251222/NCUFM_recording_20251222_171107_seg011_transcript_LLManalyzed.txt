20251222 171107 has signaled that the country could head to the polls as early as next year, even though general elections are not due until 2027. Speaking at a reception at Arlo Court, Motley urged supporters of the ruling Barbados Labour Party BLP to prepare for work in 2026, comments widely viewed as a strong indication of an early election. She told party members to be rested and ready when called, declaring that the BLP remains prepared to lead Barbados forward. The Prime Minister pointed to what she described as a strong economic performance, including sustained economic growth, record low unemployment and historically high foreign reserves, while admitting challenges still exist. If elections are called in 2026, it would mark the second time Motley has the dissolved parliament early. Political analysts say the move would follow her established pattern as the BLP continues candidate preparations across key constituencies.
