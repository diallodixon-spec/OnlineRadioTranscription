2025-12-12 15:58:59 All the ways be thy name Say this morning I woke up and I look in the mirror and every part of my body was in place many people died and never saw this day so another day i live i appreciate don't ever wanna act too high and mighty cause tomorrow i can fall down on my face so in everything lord i give you praise and that puts a down on my face. So in everything, Lord, I give you praise. And that puts a smile on my face. Lord, I thank you for sunshine. Thank you for rain. Thank you for joy. Thank you for pain. It's a beautiful day.
