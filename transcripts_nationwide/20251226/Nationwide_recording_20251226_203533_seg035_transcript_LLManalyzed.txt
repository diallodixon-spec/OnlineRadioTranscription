20251226 203533 I can't hide it, no I can't fight it It's so hard to live without the love she gave to me Doesn't she know it? I tried hard not to show it Can I make her realize that she really needs me again? I would do anything I would go anywhere There's nothing I wouldn't do Just to see her again She brightened up my everyday Made me feel so good in every way
