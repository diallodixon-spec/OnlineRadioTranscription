And I said to my daughter, let's go. She was videoing, trying to make some video, and her phone fell in the water. And the water was very dirty. And she was there looking. Siri, where's your phone? Siri, where's the phone? And she said, Mommy, I'm not leaving the phone. And Siri, where's my phone? So I ran out of the house, left her, and I sent in one of the men to assist her. She did find the phone eventually when she came, because we're going to higher heights. There's a three-story building that my cousin has above Billy. So all of us run there for rescue. When she came, I realized that the laptop was left, and I asked her to go and buy this. The water in the yard was up to her breast, and she's five feet, about eight inches, and so forth. And she said everything, the fridge turnover, mommy, the table turnover, the laptop, and everything. So buy this, everything.
