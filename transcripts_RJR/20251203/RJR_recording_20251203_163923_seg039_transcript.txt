One of these nights I'll hear your voice again You're gonna say How much you miss me You'll walk out this door But someday you'll walk back in Darling, I know I know this will be Sometimes it takes Sometimes all on your own now To find your way back Love will lead you back Someday I'll just know that Love will lead you back to my arms When you'll be lost Sure, a star's not standing still
