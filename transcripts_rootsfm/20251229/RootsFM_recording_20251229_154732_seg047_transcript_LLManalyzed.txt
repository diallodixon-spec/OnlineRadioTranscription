20251229 154732 But I know how you've been doing over yonder I'm gonna catch this flight And when I reach my destination I hope you'll be smiling You called me this evening I thought you'd drop me a line Just to say hello, my dear, I'm doing fine Doesn't matter anyway now Cause my love for you will never change Tell me what you're doing right now Cause when the push put the blame, blame on me For loving you, for loving you When, when, when Everybody gonna put blame, blame on you
