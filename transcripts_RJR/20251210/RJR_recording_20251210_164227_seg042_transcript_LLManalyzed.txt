Yeah, too deep in love and we got no way out And the message is clear This could be the year for the real thing No more will you cry Baby, I will help you never We start and end as one In love forever, we can ride it together making love with each other islands in the street that is what we are no one in between how can we be wrong send away with me to another world And we rely on each other, another From one lover to another, another
