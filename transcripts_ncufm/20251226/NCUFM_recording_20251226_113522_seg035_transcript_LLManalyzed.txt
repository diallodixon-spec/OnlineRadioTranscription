Because while reheating leftover is almost a holiday tradition, we want to make sure we're doing it wisely. So some of the safe containers that we can use in microwaves are glass. Glass is microwave safe. It doesn't leach chemicals and it handles heat very well. Another safe option is going to be ceramic. Plates, mugs and bowls are safe if they don't have metallic paint or trim And then you have the microwave safe plastics So BPA free containers are labeled microwave safe
