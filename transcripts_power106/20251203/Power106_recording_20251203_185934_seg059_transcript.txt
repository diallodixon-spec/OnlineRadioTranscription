Sorry our time is so short so we could go on, but we are out of time here now. Mr. Rowan Thomas, veteran journalist and long-time observer of the intention, sports and social affairs. Thank you very much, sir, and we want to have you on our show, keeping us abreast of what's happening in the eastern Caribbean, because I know you keep your eye on just about everything. Thanks for being here. Thank you, very much, and all the best to the people of Jamaica. See you, Bill.
