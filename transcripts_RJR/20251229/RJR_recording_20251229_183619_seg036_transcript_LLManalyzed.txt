In the space that I occupy, you enter the garage and there's a picture of a bobsled. There are pictures on the wall of different beaches in Jamaica. We have on our TV screen a reggae music channel that's just streaming constantly. Well, it's their music videos and stuff that are playing and it's the speakers, the staff on the shop floor, they're always listening to that music.
