water. Thank you for reading. All right. So shout out there. And they're saying, listen, Santa Cruz, I see in the papers where, you know, Santa Cruz is coming up and, you know, moving about. Now people are selling and what have you, but the neighboring communities, you say that don't have any water or power. All right. This one's, I did say the last one, let me, this one has to be the last one. You know what they say? They tell lawyers, you know, never say your final question because sometimes they're not the final question because the answer you get may require you to ask another question. So it's just the final one. But anyhow, good day, somebody. Could you please find out from Flo when do they plan to restore service in a section of South Cave and Yalas in St. Thomas? We have been out of service from the hurricane as there is a fallen post on the ground with the main block box. Okay. We have made several reports but no response. All right. We'll have to pass that one on. Want to thank the team today?
