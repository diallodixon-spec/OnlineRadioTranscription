Whatever it is, you know I can take it. Counting the days, how many days till I can see you again. Throwing kisses like will you catch up my night? I'm cute but with arrows babe, I'm just shooting my shot. If I could get in, drop me a pin, hop in the hole and come over. Don't wanna be friends just in the skin, I wanna get closer and closer and closer. The way you got me all in my head I think I'm better you in my bed Whatever it is, you know I can take it Counting the days, how many days till I can see you again
