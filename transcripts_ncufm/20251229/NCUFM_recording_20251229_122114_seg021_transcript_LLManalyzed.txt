20251229 122114 Sometimes you seem so close and yet so far I need another chance I need to know your mercy Just give me the strength to change within I know I'm not all that I can be My weakness seems to get the best of me But as long as you are here I know that I will make it Every step along the way Please hear my prayer A heart like yours Is my desire A heart like yours
