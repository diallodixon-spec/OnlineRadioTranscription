20251217 165831 It's time to pause. It's time to reflect. This is your opportunity to usher in the Sabbath hours with us. So join me, Lyseth Martin. And me, Lincoln Lyking, every Friday evening at 5.05 p.m. It's the Sunset Serenade, everyone who knows Fred likes Fred. Fred, thanks for all your help. Everyone would agree. If anyone will get into heaven, Fred will. Fred, I really appreciate you helping my boy with sports. Yes, Fred is a great guy, but his goodness won't get him into heaven. It won't? The Bible says that heaven is a gift from God.
