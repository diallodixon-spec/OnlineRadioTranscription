All of my friends get the same treatment on their birthdays. I remember them birthdays. If we're doing the power, we're doing the part. If we doing this, we're doing that. I like my friendships. It's why my friend circle is very small. And even though he is my longest friend, and if something goes wrong with him first, I'm going to run too because that is my best friend. I'm going to see that. But when you're going to put that towards my man, it's different. That's two different levels of things. And you said it earlier. Yes, we have a level of intimacy, but my intimacy with him is nothing compared to what I would have with my man. No, we know that. We established that and we're very happy to know that it is so. No, there is a separation. There is a difference. You mentioned boundaries. We do have boundaries. We know our limits with one another. You do? We've been doing this apparently.
