20251230 164336 3 FM. I was a ghost. I was alone. I was given the throne. I didn't know how to believe I was the queen that I meant to be I lived too long, tried to play both sides But I couldn't find my own place Caught a phallic child, cause I got too wild But now that's how I'm getting paid, cause that's real stage I'm done hiding, now I'm shining like I'm gonna be We dreaming hard, we came so far, now I believe We're going up, up, up, it's our moment
