20251216 180405 Road sign systems, how may I help you? I don't know about you, but I come here to fight Come to play a match I'm not leaving until I'm wet Come to play a mass I don't live my life with regrets No, I come to jam on a bumper Come to drink out the liquor Until my head's gone and I'm miserable All down on the ground, I'm causing trouble Look how the security watch me They don don't know I'm out there. And they smash up the place, and then they start like a zombie. I don't wait. They don't want me in their party, they. They want me because I do one way.
