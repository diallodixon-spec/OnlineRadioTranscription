Say she wants a rude boy with a rude boy wine. No wonder man there with no schoolboy wine. No mannequin, no romancing. She walk on from night till the morning. She fling it up, she fling it back. I ride it, I go handle that. She keep it up, she look that ain't what she like. She wear the roughness in she life. And when I put down the work, watch how she face light up, boy. No sweetness, that ain't she weakness. No feelings, just fuck it up like you mean it.
