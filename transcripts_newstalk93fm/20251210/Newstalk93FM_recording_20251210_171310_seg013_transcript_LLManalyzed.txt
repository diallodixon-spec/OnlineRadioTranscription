Looks like we're making up for lost time Need you to spell it out for me Boston over on all nine It's like a type of alchemy Introduce me to your best friend. I can come and slot right in. A satellite ain't even that far. I kind of wonder where you are. Already know I can't leave it alone. You're all mine. Already gave you the time and the place So don't be shy Just come be the man I need Tell me you got something to give I want it I kinda like it when you call me
