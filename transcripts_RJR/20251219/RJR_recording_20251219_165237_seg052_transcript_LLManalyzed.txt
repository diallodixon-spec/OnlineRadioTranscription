20251219 165237 I'm good to go, I'm diamond, you know I glow up. Hey, that's Alaska. Can't stop, oh, oh, in the stars tonight. So as we break down fire and set the night alight. Hey, shining through the city with a little funky soul. So when I light it up like dynamite. Whoa. Bring a friend, join the crowd, where you wanna come along Word up, talk, talk, just move, wrap it up to the wall Fair enough, the sky's the line, so I feel your act on Ladies and gentlemen, I get the message, so you should keep your eyes on the phone This is steady, heavy, can you hear the bass boom? I'm ready, whoo,in'. It's harder than it gets. This bitch chillin' like money. Hey, this all overload. I'm into that. I'm good to go. I'm down. You know I go up. And let's go. Can't stop. I'm in the stars tonight. So let's be friends.
