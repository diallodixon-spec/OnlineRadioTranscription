about how does your family celebrate Christmas? I mean, maybe growing up is a little bit than how you're doing it now. Is it the same? Are there some traditions that you maintain?

We used to work, work, work here because that's the busy time of the year for business, you know., we will have our own sorrel and fruit cake, but as well as crispy pork and roast duck. You know what I mean? So we have to mix it. We don't do don't do a lot of the gifts, but you know, gifts would be very modest, nice thing, too opulent, okay? But no, we mix it, and we even mix the long life noodle, you know, the long life noodle with ham.
