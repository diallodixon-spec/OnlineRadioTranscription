============================================================

There ain't no rules, it's up to you. No rules, it's all up to you. To get that life and party all right. Through the night or behind your ambitions. Gotta let that fool loose deep inside your soul. Wanna see your next ambition. Better do it now before you get too old Cause we're the party people night and day Living crazy, that's the only way So tonight Gotta leave the nine to five up on the shelf and just enjoy yourself cause the Madison music came to you like it's so bad at all. You live it up the road. Love me so bad at all, give me another one. Live your life up the road.
