20251217 104923 Love to watch you come and go In the tides of heaven floor Those so strong and great you are Love, love, love Stretching deep, wide and far Tiny vessels safe you keep Rocking them gently as to see Wider rough though you may be, when you are angry, mighty sea. When the storm is gone, we find you're still a playmate kind. Splashing, dashing, restless sea. There are still you seem to be. Sometimes angry, sometimes sad. Sometimes a love, you're glad. Splashing, dashing, restless. See, never still you seem to be.
