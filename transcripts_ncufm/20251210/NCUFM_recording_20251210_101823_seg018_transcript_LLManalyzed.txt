We're going to be playing a little game with the listeners. Here's how it works. I'll read a scenario about healthcare rights. You tell me right if you believe the statement is true or wrong if you believe it's not correct. You will give a professional answer at the end of each scenario. A man living with HIV goes to the health center and the nurse tells him he must come back on a different day because people like him can't mix with the general public. if they're tuned in so far. We're not going to wait too long, but me, I would say, you know what? In my ignorance, maybe about 15 years ago, I would have said right.
