20260102 142118 Light up a fire, I'ma make a chunk of a bread Rollin' in these streets And I'll protect my family friends I'll protect my enemies I'ma protect my family friends say I'm bad, I never got no traffic, you should know everything them guys say you don't help them, you give them everything they've got, I don't give a shit, no I don't, One guy that can't take me, they want you die, we realize, they want you only play with my shoes I hope you'll leave, I know the feeling One day we'll leave this place When the hour is precious Lose my love with mine and go Just so we'll be at sea One day we'll be free
