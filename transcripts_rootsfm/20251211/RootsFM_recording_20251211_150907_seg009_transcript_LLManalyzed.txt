2025-12-11 20:07:09 I'm just making any beat right now. But back in the day, the authentic sound, nice. 80s for me was the best. Some would say the 90s. But for me, true, I grew up in the 80s. That sound, the looting and stitching. You get what I mean? Yeah, but these youngsters, I don't know what they're thinking and where they're heading to, but they're making crazy money. True. But the music doesn't really go far with them in terms of probably next five years you don't really want to hear the song again. Like the 80s and the early 90s and even the 70s, you still want to hear those type of music up till now yes because the beats are natural beats you get yeah you have all the vibes and yes you go to the 70s 80s and 90s yeah you have full of vibes there because oftentimes when we go retro in general we have to move you know yes even though them call me old boy
