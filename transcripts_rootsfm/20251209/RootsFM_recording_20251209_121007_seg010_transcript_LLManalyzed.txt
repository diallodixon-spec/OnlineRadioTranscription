All my weakness, Thou who know'st, All my care, All I need, Each precious promise, Give all here and answer prayer. Thou who knowest, All my weakness, Both who know it, all my weakness. You will know it. All my care. While I plead each precious promise. Here or here., an ancient grave. Thou will know it. Oh, my baby. Thou know it, oh, my kid.
