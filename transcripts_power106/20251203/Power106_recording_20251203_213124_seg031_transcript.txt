Let every heart prepare you And heaven and nature sing, and heaven and nature sing And heaven, and heaven, and nature sing Joy to to the world and save the race. Remember songs of mine. The fields and floods, rocks, hills and plains. We keep the Southern joy, repeat the song and joy Repeat, repeat, the song and joy
