20260102 165429 I saw the clues to laugh unanswered questions My mind's heart had to know I heard it call while wandering through the darkness I'd walk a million miles to find that endless voice That speaks to me when I am in temptation Echoing my choice He said seek, he shall find. I've been with you through all times. If you're thirsty, I will quench you with my love. And if you're hungry, I will feed you with my word. And all I ask of you is that you love as I do. And if you lose your way, I'll lead you to my love. From a sinful life, I'll cleanse you in my love.
