20251222 093728 Oh, okay. Thank you so much. And, um, um, where, where, where are they on the filing? Um, um, no, so if it's your son, and of course your son's a US citizen planning for you, you don't have to wait for a visa number to become current, because that category is always going to be current. You just have to wait for the normal person time. And it normally takes about a year, a year and a half for the I-130, which is the first filing. Normally it takes about a year and a year and half for that to be processed. And then now the filing starts in the National Visa Center. Okay. Next month will be a year. So keep watching maybe make sure your son doesn't if he moves or anything or checks his email to check your email and make sure if he moves he has notified USCIS. Okay, thanks Mark. Thank you. Thank you so much everyone.
