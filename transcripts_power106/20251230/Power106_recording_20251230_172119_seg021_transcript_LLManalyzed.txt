20251230 172119 2.5-litre four-cylinder produces 182 horsepower, and acceleration is best described as adequate. But that's intentional. Engines that aren't pushed to their limits last longer. While many turbocharged rivals operate near 90% capacity, the Outback's engine typically runs at 60 to 70%, reducing wear and extending lifespan. Inside, everything is designed for durability, not luxury. Hard-wearing materials, simple controls, and a huge cargo area take priority. This is a vehicle built to survive 250,000 miles in harsh climates, not impressed in a showroom. Visibility is another hidden advantage. Thin pillars and a massive windshield give the Outback exceptional sight lines. Consumer reports found it outperformed vehicles loaded with cameras and sensors. Finally, there's the clearance. 8.7 inches, higher than many body-on-frame SUVs.
