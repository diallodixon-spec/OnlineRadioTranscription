20251224 104132 I'm telling you, my heart goes out for the people. And my district was big. They got it very hard. I know people lost everything, but I know places are worse than even that. And even some of the roads, the light pole are still hanging down the truck campus. So again, I don't know if the military is involved. I heard that they're doing some work up by camp and town but i don't know we need to train our military more to do these kind of things of course yes and employ them yeah man you're right you're right thing moving too slow man too slow too slow and nobody's saying and by the way not because you win you the election, you are a government for everyone. And you should stand up to criticism and you know, hear what the people are crying for.
