============================================================

You are God. You are God. Hallelujah. My God, he may not call when he wants, but the Lord is the leader of time. Standing there at the red sea, God's people, given to the broken, Seferah and his mighty army will take us in bondage again. Stand still and see the salvation of the Lord.
