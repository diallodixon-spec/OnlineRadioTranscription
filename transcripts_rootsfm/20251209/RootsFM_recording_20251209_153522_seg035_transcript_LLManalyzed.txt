so much without you touch now i'm back now you say just a little bit longer baby oh my love keeps growing stronger a little more time to say but in my head a love's always you and me We're fading the rain together The feeling lives on forever The memories that bring tears of joy We've had our share of bad times too Hurting each other, me and you Youought us much closer in the end There's just too much we both want far To put it all down the drain I stayed awake just for a while But now you're driving me insane Just a little bit longer, baby
