2025-12-12 12:57:31 Because of who you are, I give you praise. Because of who You are, Jesus. I will lift my voice and say, Lord, I worship you. Lord, I worship you because of who you are. I won't say because of who I am. Because of who you are, I give you glory. Not because of what you've done, but because you are I give you praise.
