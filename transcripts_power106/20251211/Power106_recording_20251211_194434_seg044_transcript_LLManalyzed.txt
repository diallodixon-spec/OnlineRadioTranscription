2025-12-11 21:18:47 here, so you can give about 30 seconds to each. Yeah, I want to actually mention that we also will be honoring some really good Jamaicans. Marva Bernard from Netball Jamaica, associate class student, will be honored. Dr. Audrey Hinchcliffe, current chairman and CEO of Manpower and Maintenance Services. She, of course, based on her involvement in health care and so on, and also on it, we'll be honored. And Carl Bradshaw, the legendary Jamaican actor, film producer, you know, from the iconic 1972 film, The Harder They Come, he will also be honored. I'm not sure if you're aware that Kyle Bradshaw was actually a coach at Excelsior and he'll take those in the winning years at Champs for the girls team. Okay, very good.
