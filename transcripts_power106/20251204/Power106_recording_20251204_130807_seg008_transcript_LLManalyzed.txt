That is nonsense. And that's a disregard for the Jamaican public, which is not unusual. It's a disregard to the media to just simply come out and say, you know, we're going for an official business and Babsy's in charge and we're going and that's it. Now, a senior person in their task force says, I will have to inform myself and get back to you. Now, if a senior member of the task force is not aware of the business that the prime minister is going on, what kind of communication is taking place within the organization? But guess what? The trolls, their followers, their lackeys, their cultists, their nincompoos will not question that because it's of no concern. Protocol doesn't matter.
