20251229 092015 So today, let's make a promise. I will use my time to grow. I will not waste it on bitterness or fear. I will invest it in love, in prayer, in service, in learning. Because every breath I take is a gift. And every moment is a chance to grow into the person God is shaping me to be. of time. Teach us to walk wisely, to redeem each moment and to grow in faith, love and purpose. May our days reflect your glory. Amen.
