20251229 120706 What do we have for tomorrow? Tomorrow we have dressing of foot and all those things. So we bind up, we bind up those things right now in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, by the blood of Jesus Christ with the power of the Holy Ghost today. We don't bind every strong man of shooting. We bind the strong man of rape. We bind a strong man of robbery, stabbing and chopping in Jesus name. And I believe God, for example, before one of His words pass, heaven and earth shall pass away. Isaiah 40 and verse 8, the grass withered, the flower faded, but the word of Almighty God stand forever. So today, Father, I pray for Isis Miller and her family right now. I pray for Brother Dwight and our family right know. I pray for the management team and their family right now. Father, I put the children in the mustard seed community before you and the request on my heart for the mustard seed community that these children will receive healing. These children will continue to get help.
