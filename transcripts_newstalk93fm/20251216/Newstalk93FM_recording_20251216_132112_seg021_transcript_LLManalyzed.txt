20251216 132112 It's your time baby, it's your time baby Get my baby That's the difference when you're my baby that's how it is when you nobody make me stop the world So tell me if you want action Until the lights back on I got the one we could last long And I didn't ever know my time Not like what I waited for lifelong I pull up in my fashion Every night I shit in any way We can go ahead and just sit down And chill up in my villa Take it out the whole night
