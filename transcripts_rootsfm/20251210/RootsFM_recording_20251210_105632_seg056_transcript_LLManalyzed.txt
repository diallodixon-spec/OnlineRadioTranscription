If you don't try, then you never will fail. But you surely won't get anything done. So hear me out. Just do your thing and learn from your mistakes. When I see my friends become my enemy I ask them far No any of them will not go No light, no power Cause I know Dirty and can't sweep with broom They are like the trees that can't bloom
