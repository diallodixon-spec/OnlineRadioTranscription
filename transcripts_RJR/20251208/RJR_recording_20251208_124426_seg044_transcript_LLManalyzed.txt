There's some technical issue. Since that one point machine was not working, then another it is not caught, then it's not ready. This is from early October. Yes, we got reports of that. It was in the news. And hopefully it resolved it. I don't know if they have. But this is, of course, causing some concerns. At the downtown tax office, trying to remember. I think maybe it was. Anyhow, hopefully you can sort that out. Persons are waiting, you know. And I found it rather efficient, starting to know what the machine has, you know, has its challenges, and I'm not sure whether it is a part issue or what, maybe, because also lots of revenue. You don't want that to happen, you know, that the machine is not working, apart from your own inconvenience.ounter and chemotherapy drugs, visit Dean's Pharmacy Papine. When others don't have it, we do.
