Thank you so much for staying with us. You're listening to Beyond the Headlines. This is Radio Jamaica 94 FM. I'm Dionne Jaxmillo. Thank you so much being with us. Wherever you are, it's Wednesday, December 3, 2025. Whether you're on radiojamaican94fm.com, on onespotmedia.com, or Radio Frequencies, or the Radio Jamaica app. And here's your periodic reminder. Download the Radio Jamaica app now. That way you can get this and other programs at your convenience. If you can't listen live, we keep about five days worth of programs on the app, but you have about three or four apps there named Radio Jamaica, all right? So you have to look for our logo. So look for the Radio Jamaica logo. If you're not sure what that is, go to any of our social media pages, you'll see it, and then look for that logo, but you look for the logo, not the name, to be frank. Then you download about Jamaica's financial situation. We're listening to some clips, we'll get some comment from the opposition.
