20251217 093726 Here's my heart Here's my mind Give you my soul, Lord Need you to take control Cause I've tried it all Tried it on my own blood But what I found is I can't make it On my own, on my own I can make it, I can make it Tell me, what can I do? Cause I can't live without you No one can before you, I'm just your friend
