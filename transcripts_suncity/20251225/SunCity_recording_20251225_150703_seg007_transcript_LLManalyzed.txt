20251225 150703 I'm for the young ones who want to go to school. Go to school and learn to read and write. It's not just physical madness going on, it's spiritual madness. And if you cannot see with two eyes, then, Hall, you're going to open your third eye. Don't let the devil catch you. No, no. Make me a proud mother. Let me see you grow to be a good man. That's all I ask. If you're not listening to Sun City FM right now, you're feeling the vibes right now. Put your hand out here now. All right, grab your phone now.
