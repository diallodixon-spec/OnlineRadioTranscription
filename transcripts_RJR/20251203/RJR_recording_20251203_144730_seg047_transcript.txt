If you're just joining us, we're speaking with Dr. Bewaji, consultant pediatrician and director of Bola Health Medical Center. It's such a beautiful name though. And she is here helping us through simple and practical ways to stay healthy and safe this holiday season. Families are going to be storing leftovers or bulk groceries this season because you know it's Christmas time so we're going to put down the big cooking and then when it's done we have to put up some whatever whatever. What are some of the safe storage habits that we should follow to avoid spoilage or even illness?
