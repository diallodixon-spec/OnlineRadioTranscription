20251215 123934 My eyes were clear and bright Rockin' around the Christmas tree at the Christmas party hop Mistletoe on where you can't see every double child has to stop Rockin' around Christmas tree, let the Christmas spirit break Later we'll have some pumpkin pie And we'll do some caroling You will get a sentimental feeling When you hear the voices singin' Let's be jolly,, Bethels with vows of holly Rockin' around the Christmas tree, have a happy holiday Everyone dancing merrily in the new old-fashioned way
