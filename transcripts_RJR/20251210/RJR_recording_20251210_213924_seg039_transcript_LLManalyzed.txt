Hey, Nick! Hey, Nick! Oh, Ricky, you're so fine You're so fine You've got my mind, hey, Nick Hey, Nick! You've been around all night and that's a little long You think you've got the right, but I think you've got it wrong Won't change you so goodnight, so you can take me home again But when you say you will, it always means you won't You're giving me the chill, baby, please, baby, don't. Every night you still leave me all alone again. I'm thinking what a pity you don't understand. You take me by the heart when you take me by the hand.
