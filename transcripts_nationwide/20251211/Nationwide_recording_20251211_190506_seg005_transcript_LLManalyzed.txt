2025-12-11 19:15:00 across the country and I've been warning about kids just moving across to other platforms and not getting off social media at all and I am astonished that the Prime Minister today could not say what success was when it comes to very what he's been declaring world-first legislation we all you know put it through Parliament and the Minister herself not being able to say what success is. So what are we just having a great time? I really don't understand that because that means that they're trying to get off the hook if it does fail. Yeah, I'll come back to that to draw attention to those failures. Yeah, but we'll find out in coming days. I suppose we should get some numbers, I suppose, of how many accounts have been suspended. We'll get feedback from parents and children who are confirming that their accounts have closed. But there are reports, of course, as you referred to, of workarounds. People are either faking their age or they're using VPN.
