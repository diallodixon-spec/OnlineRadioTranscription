20251226 200305 period when people go crazy. All right, we want to thank you so much for having joined us throughout the quarter, throughout the year as we studied together from the Word of God. This week we looked at choose this day, the ending of the book of Joshua as he appealed to the Israelites to choose which God they intend to serve. Whether the gods were on the other side of the river, in the land of the Amorites, the land of the Canaanites, or the land in which you dwell, the land of Amorites. Are you going to choose their gods or are you going to be faithful to your God? The God of Israel, the God of Isaac, the God of Jacob, the God of Abraham? So on Monday we looked at sincerity and truth, worshipping God in sincerity and truth. What does that mean? To worship God in sincerity with all our being, our entire spirit.
