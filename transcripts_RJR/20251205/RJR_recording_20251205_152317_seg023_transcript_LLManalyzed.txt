You're the one I want to before my liver start to fail you're the one I want, oh Before my liver starts to fail You're the one that I need, oh Before cassava starts to hail If I ever leave, oh Make what I can, it need to go Far away, far away So I am looking for a sister She over my lover my lover. She's dirty dollar, she's the way designer. So I am looking for a sister. She's over my lover, she's dirty dollar. She's the way designer, she's giving me assurance.
