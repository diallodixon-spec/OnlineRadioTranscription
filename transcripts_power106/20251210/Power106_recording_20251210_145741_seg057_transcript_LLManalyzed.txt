You see, Michael was so loved by the sugar workers. And when we talk about sugar workers, my sympathy goes out to all the people in West Milan. Right. You know, West Milan is a sugar bar. Yeah, man. It's a massive piece of the sugar belt. Yes, yes. It's really something that's home to Westgate. It's a workhouse facility. It was given to the Chinese and they have virtually locked it down. Fomal has a capacity of 100,000 pounds of sugar, a rated capacity, and they are doing about 18,000, 20,000 tons. And that can only, if that continues, it can only lead to more poverty. But my heart goes out to the people there for that. They're sure, because many of them who I know personally, and I know they're suffering at this time, but I know that we will overcome. We will definitely overcome. We will overcome.
