God, I am forgiven, I've been saved and sanctified Through the jets and through the trials All the times I could have died I will brag, I will show off because of you, God So when you see me, when you see me Me, I'm worse than a delight, worse than a delight I give you peace of mind My heart is always on your side Our connection is rare to find That's why I'm not gonna let you go
