20260101 094121 Who never bought to give up You were the dreamer who always accepted my love, all my love I heard you, I tried to turn your love away And still you showed me you cared and you wanted to stay Somehow fortune was there on my side Cause I'm loving you now And it feels so right Take me away tonight
