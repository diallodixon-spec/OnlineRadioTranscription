20251217 095340 recently I just shared with you where people who pay health insurance they're gonna pay 16 to 20,000 dollars more per month for you to be earning 200,000 dollars a month you'd have to get a 10% increase just to cover the new health insurance cost the additional health insurance cost because health insurance movement has been a very serious and impactful movement on the people who pay health insurance now. Very, very serious. I'm not fact editing, but I just went through some numbers with an employee. They would have gone to pay between $16,000 to $20,000 more per month for their package. And they're not taking home $200,000 right now. And no company wants to offer you 10% which will have just covered the health insurance additional component so a lot of things that I know there to the workers and the cost and there is no sort of control no measuring of what we do and measuring the steps it
