20251226 171811 Hey, girl, what's up? So hold on. Why you look so vexed this early? They ain't a just act. Lisa, it is so good to see you. But sorry you catch me like this, girl. My uncle sent one bar along when my family go for clarity. You don't want to hear the cries of the people they put on or something. But matters worse, me hear say half of the thing they missing. And me know say a custom. Girl, how you know say a customs?? At least stop going like you don't have any sense. You don't see everybody talking about it in the media. You don't have to stop listening to hearsay. Have you ever experienced that? Customs don't go into your package, suitcase, barrel or cargo unless you ship the item or the agent stand up right there when they might inspect it. Listen, customs job is to protect the borders, collect revenue and to facilitate trade. Them not collect or store shipment, them inspect it and somebody have to present it for inspection.
