Well, hang on. What? Let's see. Lunch tomorrow looks like a bologna sandwich on white bread. Lunch tomorrow? And it doesn't look like you've done the laundry yet. Oh, and you're using that fabric softener I don't like. And my shirts aren't pressed. Bob, I just want to know if you love me well I'd say right now including this lovely dinner my love for you is lukewarm lukewarm it's a solid three out of ten and I'm sure it'll be higher after you do the laundry after I do Bob you don't love
