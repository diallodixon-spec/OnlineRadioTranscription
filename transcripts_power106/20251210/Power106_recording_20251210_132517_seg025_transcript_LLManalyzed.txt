not the problem. The problem that I think that we have, that we need to address, is that we need to put the pieces of the country first, rather than a political agenda. Because even when I listen to some people, and what they try to criticize about, they're very dumb. Extremely dumb. Because I go back to you lost here, which they would have claimed was not one of the brightest. But what I'm seeing when I was sitting on you lost here time, I didn't see it. You with me? What I see happening in parliament yesterday, Simon. All of us have to be ashamed of it. The behaviour just wasn't correct. And I'm not calling down PMP or JP. I just said the whole thing wasn't right.
