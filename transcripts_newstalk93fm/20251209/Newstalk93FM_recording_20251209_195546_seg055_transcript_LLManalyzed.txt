She want me to go down there, ride it, ride it Tell what she telling me What she say When you come in San Fernando She want me go down there Ride it, ride it So love me go down there ride it, ride it Hear what she tellin' me What she said When ya come in San Fernando Until o'clock in the mornin''re calling When things get boring It's not gonna live on I thought that was the one I thought that this was love But when I hear the scene You know she's a brain to be Now why you let me last?
