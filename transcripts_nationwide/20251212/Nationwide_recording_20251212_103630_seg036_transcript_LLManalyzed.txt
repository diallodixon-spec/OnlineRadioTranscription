2025-12-12 10:54:02 we literally have been on the ground working because we can't feel this heart because at the end of the day we have to help persons rebuild and restart now when you listen go into the communities and hear some of the stories it's even we've seen persons were on their beds bedridden because we penetrated deep into the communities of siloes especially in central is there and we hear some of these stories the horror stories that they went through they't move. They're hearing their roof lift off. A lot of them don't have family members even close by. And so because of that, because of those stories and because of how important it is to us, we had to move heaven on earth, literally, to get relief supplies to them, to get essential supplies to them. To get building supplies to them. And so we're doing a myriad of things, including working with our schools to get in supplies to them, to get essential supplies to them to get building supplies to them and so we're doing a myriad of things including working with our schools to get in some generators so they can start working back because of these stories that we would have heard because we were out in the communities from the I think the Thursday after the Thursday after the storm we had brought in our staff
