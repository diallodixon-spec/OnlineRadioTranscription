I have a thespian friend, I won't call her name. When she embarked on her, I don't know if she still have the debt, you know. So she not eat meat, you know. But when you see the meat, she not, he not eat. So me say, well, you not eat meat. And she say, yes, you not eat it, but just, you know, smell it and it in there. And the gravy half of it. The gravy half of it, and me say, girl, girl. So she share it out the same way. That was many years ago. I want to ask her now if she still not eat, if she still does not smell meat and not eat it. Talk about delusional. That's a rough, that's a rough but a pompous mouth girl. That not gonna work. My week was like a big Julie mango. Whoa. Oh, that's nice.
