as cheap as, and I stand corrected, as cheap as probably $7,000 for the smallest tire, and I'm going to go very extreme, up to $200,000 per tire, depending on the car that you're driving. So, most cars, or any car, no car really should be hitting potholes on a regular basis you know if you will be driving on you you should really and truly have like one pothole every what 50 miles or you know and let me tell you i had to change two tires today right oh today let me tell you that is nearly 70 000 for two tires wow right and let me say this it's not the the you know it's not every time the cheaper tire is the best tire
