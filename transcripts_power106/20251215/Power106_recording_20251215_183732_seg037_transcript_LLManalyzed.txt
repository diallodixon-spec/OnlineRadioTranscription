20251215 183732 Yes, and certainly, every single day of this life, I think about the times we used to have David Malohan and myself going out to the mayor in the trash, taking the boys over there, coaching the medical team. So it's really very special that I see. And remember, one of the brightest you'll ever see in terms of his ability to coach, and he's superb. And he's not just a football, people will remember that. But track and field as well. And another day in our lives. For us, we don't remember the great brotherhood. That is very true, that is very true. I know you are aligned with what David has done in the power script, so yes, we want to follow suit, you know. Yes, absolutely. All right, now we're talking about something new here, a new mentorship program. Talk to us about concept and objective for ourselves.
