20251224 112820 Now certain things be slapped, so we disappear to the habitat ghost Everybody's tryna talk to me, but nobody wanna hear me out Everybody's got some things to say, honestly, then just I move them out The things I say, I'm dalvin' you with... Leave me alone, leave me alone Oh, gosh Yo, everybody's trying the top to me And I don't know just what to breathe Certain things the mirror and things them see Call me up on the radio and TV. One bag along, talking, talking. No wonder one of those days won't make you ever want to stop. Come close and you'll see I'm gonna get paid. Sometimes I don't understand why you can't give me some space.
