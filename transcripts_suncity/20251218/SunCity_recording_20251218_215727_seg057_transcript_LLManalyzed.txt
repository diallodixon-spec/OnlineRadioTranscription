20251218 215727 I'm so thankful I was made for you Could've left me unread, but you liked it Ooh, she liked it, laid me down Open up, take it out Any way you want, I'll take it out Know you wanna be classy But girl, it's me, we ain't gotta wait around Let me stand by you, cause they can feel it The only thing I wanna see is you the way I know you now There's no place like home No time like Christmas, I'm loving eyes No place like home No time like laying up with the one that you love
