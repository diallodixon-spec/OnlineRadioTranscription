============================================================

They're putting up resistance But I know that my faith will lead me on I can't say what life will show me But I know what I see I can't say where life will lead me But I know where I'll be Tried my hand at love and friendship But all that's is passed and gone This little boy is moving on Sitting here in the boat waiting for the tide to flow. Sitting here, in limbo, knowing that I have to go.
