Nationwide Night TfM As long as you dreamin' bout me, ain't no problem I don't got nobody just with you right now To tell the truth, I look better under you I can't lose when I'm with you How can I snooze and miss the moment? You're just too important I'm body to body like you do I can't lose When I'm with you I can just lose and miss the moment You're just too important Nobody do body Like you do, you do In a drop tie ride with you I feel like Scarface And then why you bitch with me
