Can I read something about them, yeah? Yeah? It's like the people who go to Nyabingi in pit four and go take on Rasta in conversations and don't know anything about Rasta. Go read something about Rasta, man. Before you jump up and say, yo Rasta, man, I talk about Nyabingi today now. And Rasta turn to you and say, are you a Nyabingi? No, but I want to talk Rasta. Can you spell the word Rasta? Yeah, I can spell Rasta turn to you and say are you a Nyabingi? No but I want to talk Rasta. Can you spell the word Rasta? Yeah I can spell Rasta. Do you think that qualifies you to have a conversation about Rasta Farai? Not really. Why do people do that? I've seen so many when I go to Nyabingi people come and strike up a conversation with Nyabingi and embarrass themselves because they don't know anything about Rasta. They just have a feeling inside deep in my soul about Rasta. Let me tell you my feelings. Information is power. Go read something man, all right? Take care of yourselves everybody. I just want to say thanks to of course my guest today Sophia Fraser
