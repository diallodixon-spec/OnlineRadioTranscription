Yeah. Yeah. One of the things to Tanya is. No, because sometimes it's a female artist and depending on who the producer or the manager one. They never give me an access. They never even try. But tonight they made a way where I feel comfortable. Most things, it was trendy then. And I didn't muggle like a stick. So most things look like you need to try to be fashionable. But then I grew, as I grew my body, I grew with me. I'm in a cure. So me and out there like blow up on the breeze like tumbleweed. I mean, I think some of my producers and audience too dig it, but I don't care. Because I come here for the content of my music and I never dropped a catch there. You see, if you can't tell me say, you know I make good music.
