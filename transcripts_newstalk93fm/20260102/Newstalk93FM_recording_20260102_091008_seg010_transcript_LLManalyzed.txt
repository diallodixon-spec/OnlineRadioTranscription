20260102 091008 This is my apology, follow me, come and see what you mean to all of me You're a treasure in my eyes The greatest pleasure in my life Cause when you're living for the new Honesty, hurry please Home is where the heart should be Pretty feathers in disguise Not Not together we will rise. So don't you ever let me down again. Cause I'm depending on you. So you better come through this time. Please hear my cry.
