all at once. Former Prime Minister PJ Paterson. The man accused of killing retired journalist Barbara Gale has been further remanded until next year for further case management hearing. Travis Ellis, who is charged with murder and robbery with aggravation, returned to court today, but the matter could not proceed because a psychiatric report ordered months ago is still not ready. Mr. Ellis's attorney Donahue Martin, who held for lead counsel Tom Tavares-Vincent, argued that two separate psychiatric reports are required and expressed concern about the length and delay in getting even one. Mr. Ellis is accused of murdering the 77-year-old retired journalist who was found stabbed to death at her home in Caymanas Estates in Catherine on December 17 last year. Her Mercedes Benz was discovered the following day in Gregory Park and Mr. Ellis was arrested just hours later in a nearby Grange Lane area. He reportedly gave police a caution statement about his alleged involvement.
