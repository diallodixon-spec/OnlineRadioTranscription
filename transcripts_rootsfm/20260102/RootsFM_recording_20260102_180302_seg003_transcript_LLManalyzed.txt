20260102 180302 Yesterday you broke my little heart Now you're running back, say you wanna make a new start There is no reason for you to come knocking on my door There is no vacancy for you anymore You are a cheater and a deceiver You ain't no good girl, you ain't no good You took my heart and you tore it out of my heart Telling your friends it was that good from the start Seemed like you were just waiting around
