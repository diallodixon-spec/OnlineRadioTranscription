20251230 145542 I love you, and I need you Nelly, I love you, I do need you No matter what I do, all I think about is you Even when you move my boo, you know I'm crazy over you I met this chick and she just moved right off the block for me And she got the hots for me, the finest thing my heart can say But oh no, she got a man and a son though We're not so fair cause I wait for my cue and just listen Play my position like a show star, pick up everything my man in any no time
