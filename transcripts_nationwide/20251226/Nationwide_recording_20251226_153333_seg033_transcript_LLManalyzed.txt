20251226 153333 I've been hoping that we all get along You wrote a face, a picture, and a funny jager on your pop-up smile I told you I left you, you called me a liar You tried to take and break us I've been on my own, alone, alone But we ain't never left alone, alone, alone And this is telling you don't feel like this is wrong Relax a little friend, this won't take too long If when you're feeling alone You can call my mom And tell her about a way to go Teach them something before they lose their soul
