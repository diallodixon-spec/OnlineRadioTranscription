20260101 161712 Oh So I'm going to drink with a kit of color. I'm in the middle of a thing, I'm going to laugh. I tell you my crush, we are treading free, bust this thing apart, y'all. No more, one day, my fury will reach out. I don't want you at the top, or you'll bust the place apart. I look at them and they say something, I live for respect. I paint your body to day and night. You watch them, you hold them, hold them tight.
