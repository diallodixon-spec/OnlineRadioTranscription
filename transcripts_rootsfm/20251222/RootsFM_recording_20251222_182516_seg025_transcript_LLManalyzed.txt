20251222 182516 Just let the music play. We're hand in hand just to trust and now we face to face. I wanna take you away. Put the tape into the music. DJ and it plays. I just can't refuse it. I like the way you do. People often do it. Please don't stop, please don't stop. Turn the lights off in this place And she shines just like a star And I swear I know her face I just don't know who you are Turn the music up in here I still hear her loud and clear like she's right there in my ear telling me that she wants to own me to control me
