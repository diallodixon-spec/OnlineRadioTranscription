20251230 161009 goodbye those tears I cry now I can't get over it so don't you ever let me down again cause I'm depending on you so you better come through this time please hear my cry and if I ever let you down my friend it was a misunderstanding So if I took it for granted Then I promise from today I'll go drunk like I never drunk Waved like I never waved Fired like I never won before Just to show you I'm sorry, I'm sorry And I need you back in my life Look at people by the truck Emotions running high We are not in the sky Death running down we high Can't you tell that we sorry? We sorry And we need you back in we high In the back of our home
