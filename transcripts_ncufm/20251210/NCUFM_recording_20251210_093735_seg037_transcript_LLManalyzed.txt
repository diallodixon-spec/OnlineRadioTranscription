============================================================

I've been there a time or two When life seems to stay the same for a while You wanna change but don't know how to It's the place where you feel empty inside Can't put your finger on the knee I look at God and see what I wanna be I look at me and see what I knows Seasons change and then they pass No way to know how long then last
