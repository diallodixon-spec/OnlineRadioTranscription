20251229 125526 What kind of life would that be? I need you in my arms, need you to hold You're my world, my heart, my soul If you ever leave Baby, you would take away everything good in my life And tell me now How do I live without you? I want you to know How do I breathe without you? If you ever go How do I breathe without you, if you ever go? How do I ever, ever survive? How do I, how do I, oh how do I live?
