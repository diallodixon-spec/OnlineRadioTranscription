20251212 111307 You're really lucky underneath it all You're really lucky You know some real bad tricks and you need some discipline But lately you've been trying real hard and giving me your back And you give me the most fortunate sleep that I've ever had And when it's really bad, I guess it's not that bad You're really lovely underneath it all all Do you want to love me underneath it all? I'm really loving underneath it all
