You have not given us policy. What you're saying is that you have not a handle on what is going on. Or you have not taken the thing seriously. Because what we have here in Charleston is that you will have about 20 US billion in economic losses. We look at tourism, we look at agriculture, we look at all of these things. We look at our food, we look at our housing stock. These are the things that will be impacting all of this economy.
