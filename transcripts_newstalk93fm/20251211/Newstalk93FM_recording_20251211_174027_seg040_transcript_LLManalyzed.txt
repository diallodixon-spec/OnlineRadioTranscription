Breathe and take my breath away. At your altar, I'm the clay Oh, my, my, you're taking me out of the ordinary I want you laying me down till we're dead and buried On the edge of your knife, staying drunk on your vibe The angels up in the clouds Are jealous now that we've found So let's go out, out, out ordinary, ordinary You got me kissing the ground, ground, sanctuary, sanctuary Share with me what you've done
