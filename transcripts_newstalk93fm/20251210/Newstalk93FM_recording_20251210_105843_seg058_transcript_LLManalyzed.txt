If you're really there Don't make me fall in love again If he won't be here next year Santa, tell me if he really cares Cause I can't give it all away If he wont be here next year I've been down this road before Falling in love on Christmas night But I knew you'd stay I woke up and you wasn't by my side Now I need someone to hold Be my fire in the cold But it's hard to tell if this is just a fling Or if it's in love again If you won't be here next year Santa, tell me
