20251217 101408 Do you ever come to the ghetto? Do you ever wonder why we're so disordered? Santa Claus, when will you come to the ghetto? Ghetto! Santa Claus, they would like to see how those friends move. See you in the papers, you're on TV. Give him a toss to something big. Wondering what's happening to poor people like me. Who is it because we know how to do it? Do you ever come to the ghetto?
