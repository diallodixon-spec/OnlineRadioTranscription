20251224 105835 I dedicate this one to all the Jamaya, my salt fish. In Jamaica, it's the national dish. I love, in your mouth, the cocoa. Give me banana and the chow chow. The youth, they might eat them bun and cheese. Give me the chicken and the rice and peas. Sarin, Irish mash and soursop. Jamaica food, it good for your back. Yellow's on his way. A lot of food on his plate. Children stop crying.
