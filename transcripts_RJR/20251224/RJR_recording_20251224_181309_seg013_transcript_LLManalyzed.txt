20251224 181309 In just a moment, we are going to be going back to our songs. We're going to be starting with, let me see, Santa Claus, Do You Ever Come to the Ghetto by Kronix, chosen by Ramarda Lyons. Before that though, let me share some more of your greetings here. Herman in Clarendon says, best wishes to my personal physician for over 40 years. One and only Winston Dawes who will be celebrating a special milestone tomorrow. Dr. Dawes, I really appreciate you and crave for you. God's continued blessings. And let me add our own greetings to that and happy special milestone when it comes. Dr Dawes. I also have, let's see, a listener saying please send Merry Christmas shout out to all the members of the Hunstown Citizens Association who've worked very hard throughout the year. Most of them did not miss one meeting during the year. Merry Christmas to you all. Also remind them that the Association's Christmas will be on Wednesday, December 31.
