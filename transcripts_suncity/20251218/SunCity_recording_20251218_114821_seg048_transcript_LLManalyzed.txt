20251218 114821 You don't have to tell me anything. I can see everything in your eyes. It's always you. I don't need an excuse to be the woman in me. It's so hard to believe that all the real is to me to be the soul. Love us every day. And I breathe, live together in a world without any harmony. Side by side on my piano way. Even, oh Lord, why don't we?
