20251219 113422 Dad, can you drop me off here? Oh, I can drive you all the way to school. I don't need you anymore, so stay out of my life and leave me alone! Basically, we have told God to get out of our lives. Bummer about wrecking your car, man. And you don't have insurance? Yeah, can you believe it? My dad has all that money and he won't pay my car insurance. Now I have to pay for the wreck myself. It's just not fair. Can we expect God to give us His blessing and His protection if we demand that He leave us alone? The Bible says that if we return to the Lord, He is gracious and compassionate and will not turn His face from us. Will you turn to Him?
