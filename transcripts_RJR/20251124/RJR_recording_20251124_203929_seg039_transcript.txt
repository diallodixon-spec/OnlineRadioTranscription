============================================================

Some guys have all the love some guys have all the rain Some guys have the sunshine in their lives My life is always filled with rain Someone to take on a walk by the lake Dear Lord, let it be Someone to shout, someone who's laughing to cry It's that movie I do believe I would die Just to looking in your eyes and finally stay with me? Oh, it's you're just a dream and just realize it seems I'm not that lucky.
