20260102 204535 To ask you as we look at this section of it in terms of the the whole matter of word processing presentation and web page design in terms of the content how much time is spent on this particular section and Does the SBA know in its current form does that include creating a web page? Definitely. So the SBA requires us to create a web page, yes. And for word processing, right now our grade 11s are required to create a brochure and fillable form in Microsoft Word. So actually a form that can be filled out online, they'll be able to create that in Microsoft Word for it. So yes, and as I said before, the 10 marks is the SV and for the word processing is 20 marks for it. So we do mail merge with them as well. Mail merge is a must. That's a staple. Yes.
