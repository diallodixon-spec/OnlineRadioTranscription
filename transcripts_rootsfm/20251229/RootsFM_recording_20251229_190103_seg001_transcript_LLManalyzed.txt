I'll show you them cause you left the bottle Cause I know they sell them cause no they can't play And none care come in and charge that to spray So she lies and we All I can see around us is just violence and crime Full time for us to centralize Socialize and realize Let the sun shine around every day Let the moon shine through the peaceful nights This is seven times nice and seven times sad
