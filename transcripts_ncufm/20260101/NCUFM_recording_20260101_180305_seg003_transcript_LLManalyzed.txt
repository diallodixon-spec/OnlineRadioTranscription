Swinging over to cricket as Phil Salt and Michael Pepper once again laid the foundation as Abu Dhabi Knight Riders defeated the Delhi Capitals by 50 runs to keep their International League T20 campaign alive. The opening pair added 122 for the first wicket, with Pepper top-scoring with 72 off 49 balls while Salt chipped in with a brisk 43. A sudden collapse followed with the Knight riders slipping to 142 for 6 after losing Salt, Pepper, Andre Russell, Alex Hales, and Liam Livingston in quick succession. Jason Holder restored late momentum, smashing on unbeaten 22 off 11 balls to lift the total to 158 for 6. In reply, the defending champions never recovered after losing early wickets as Sunil Narain claimed 3 for 12 and Livingston added 3 for 26 to dismantle the capital's chase. Holder sealed the win with two wickets in two balls confirming a qualifier two clash against Kieron Pollard's M.I.
