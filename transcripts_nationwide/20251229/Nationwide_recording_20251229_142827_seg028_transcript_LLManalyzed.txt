20251229 142827 My feelings are strong for you, so strong I know I am far from you I'll be standing there right next to you, girl Baby love my love, I love you like my mama Make me step with a dance and sing, cha-la-la-la Better ring than make a deal with your papa So long before my boss he need a deal with my proper When you turn and you walk through the door It hurts me so You said it hurts me so Baby, when you look at me and you say goodbye
