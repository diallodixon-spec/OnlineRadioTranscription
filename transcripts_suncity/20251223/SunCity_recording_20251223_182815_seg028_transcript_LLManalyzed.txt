20251223 182815 I've got to take the time to chant a prayer You've blessed my life eternally, I'm grateful In the midst of enemies, you keep my plate full Sometimes I fail, what will you do? What should you do? I'm here to sing songs of praise, and use up my vice. They're every single tool on me right. So many places I walk, if I never feel far, then I would have never been so attacked. So many nights struggle by, and you see the man I ride, and I dream pretty.
