20260102 204334 syllabus and it's exciting. It's so exciting for the children more than problem solving. Problem solving is a problem for them but when they reach the website, they have no limits to the creation and when you say that if we teach them things outside of the syllabus, yes we do. At the end of website development, a student should be able to create their own website. You know that a lot of our students are entrepreneurs and their business owners, they have their different business or their social media personalities, right? So they'll be able to actually build their own website at the end of this course. It's very exciting for them. We do not limit them at all. This is one aspect of the syllabus that we don't tell them what to use. So some of them will use, they're guided. We tell them, okay, you can go ahead and use Wix to create the website, or you can go ahead use Google Sites, but they have no limits. They go ahead and they really create something and we're really impressed.
