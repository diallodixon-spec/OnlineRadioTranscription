20251212 180302 Well, good evening and welcome to the Friday edition of Power Play for the 12th day of December, double 12th day, year of course 2025. My name is Krip, I'm an Android participant for 106 FM. The digital sound we all use can and indeed contain represents sporting matters, sporting issues for your information as well as for your entertainment. We have features for you. But before I get to that though, in our format, we speak to administrators, we speak to coaches. No question about that. And naturally, the athletes participating locally and internationally. Also, the officials making sure there is fair play each day or each game locally and internationally. Then we have features for you, such as your today in sports history coming up around about 6.30. At 7.15 we have a did you know feature for you. 7.45 is your sports update and the quote of the day will be updated after that. Now, being a Friday
