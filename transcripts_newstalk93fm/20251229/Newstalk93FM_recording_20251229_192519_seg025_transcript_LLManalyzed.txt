20251229 192519 I've been patient and I've been waiting Call me stubborn, but I can't get over it You left and never said goodbye Those tears I cried, no, I can get over my cry and if i ever let you down my friend it was a misunderstanding so So I thought you'd get forgotten. And I promise from today, I'll go drunk like I never drunk. Waved like I never waved. Fired like I never won before. Just to show you I'm sorry. I'm sorry. And I need you back.
