They can donate for us because as we move to different areas, we're not taking the water tank that we have. We want to leave it in the community. You leave it as a gift. Yes, we want that. Yes, we don't want to. We don't want to move because even now, the one that is left in this community, the community is able to use it, right? Even water is gone, they're able to use it to continue. So things like that. And also, we want persons to be able to share our story as well. Volunteer, that is a big part of the Lions Pride group as well. So even if you can't give anything financially or you don't have a gift that you can give to us, you can volunteer your time. That counts for a lot. We have quite a few volunteers that have done that, and we appreciate it. Even from the community, they have volunteered. So in those regards, you can become a part of the Lion Pride group. That's fantastic.
