Jamaica, whatever came our way this year, we are still here to celebrate Christmas and to count our blessings. Make the Christmas catch you in a good mood and because that might not be so easy this time around, we have something for you. The Kingston College Chapel Choir is on hand to bring good tidings of comfort and out of sight. Through the years we'll be, or we'll be together.
