20251222 112723 are scared now because it has it is dragging on people still have the hope that this thing would somehow end and it will stand off the standoff will end um but they are scared and there was one Friday for example when there was a notice that went around that the army had called in all its members and everybody left their jobs and the schools closed and there was panic in the highway people just just had to desecrate. They wanted to be out. They thought a missile was going to land any minute. So no, it could not be that, right? But it's the panic that ensued and the rush to get food and people. There are no more people who have stores stocked in case a war breaks out. Wow. So, and Tabebo is particularly scared because a radar has been installed there with a temporary presence, ongoing presence of military personnel. They did not, they had no clue that was going to happen. Nobody told them. So yes, it's a place where, and you know, we have a lot of conjuring this year.
