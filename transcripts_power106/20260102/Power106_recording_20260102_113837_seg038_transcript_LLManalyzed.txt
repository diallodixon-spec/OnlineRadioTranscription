20260102 113837 Do you agree with Chelsea changing the coach after 19 Premier League games? Yes. Because you must be doing a pile of foolishness. And I'm not impressed by winning the World Cup Championship or the Conference League. This is Chelsea we're talking about. This is Chelsea. Two-time Champions League winners. Premier League champions. No man, FA Cup winners. I come bring a mid-table man from Leicester to come run my thing. I take off, I take off, um, Cold Palm after 65 minutes, where you're trailing, where you're even two-all. With Bournemouth, where you can't beat Leeds, you lose to Sunderland, always with the struggle games. You draw with Arsenal, which is crazy. No man, if you run with that, you keep playing gone that show.
