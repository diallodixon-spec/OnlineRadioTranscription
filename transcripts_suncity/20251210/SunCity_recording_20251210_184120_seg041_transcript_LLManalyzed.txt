Take me back into the arms I held. Leave me like you did before. Dance me once again. And we'll never win. There is no one like you. Haunted more. Don't go. We know your breath. You're listening to San 50 Radio 104.9 SM I'll be waiting for you Here inside my heart Hold on Oh, I still love you more You will stay
