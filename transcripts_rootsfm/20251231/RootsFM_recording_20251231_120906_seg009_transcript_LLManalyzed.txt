20251231 120906 in helping those who have suffered through Hurricane Melissa. We pray, O God, for many to come to know the love and the peace that they will have with the Savior and to surrender their lives to Him. We pray for those who are doing the work on the field and to the many, many pastors and evangelists and bishops, yes, and community volunteers. We pray for this kind of partnership. We ask, O Lord, that you would bless all those who partner together to supply and assist in the needs of others, to strengthen them, and to protect them and their family. Father, we pray we give you time to respond to us, whether through spoken word, whether through, you know, a means where we can see and identify that you are dead.
