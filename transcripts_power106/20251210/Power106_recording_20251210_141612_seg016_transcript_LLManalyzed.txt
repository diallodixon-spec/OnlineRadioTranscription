Lisa, it is so good to see you. But sorry you catch me like this, girl. My uncle said when I'm bailing, when my family go for clarity, you don't want to hear the price of the people they put on the something. Make matters worse, me hear say half of the thing they missing, and me know say a customs. Girl, how you know say a customs? Lisa, stop going like you don't have no sense, man. You know say everybody that talk about it in the media. You know, if you stop listening to hearsay, you ever experience that? Customs don't go into your package, suitcase, barrel or cargo unless you will ship the item or the agent stand up right there when they are inspecting it. Listen, customs job is to protect the borders, collect revenue and to facilitate trade. They don't collect or store shipment, they inspect it. And somebody has to present it for inspection. So how do customs ever get so much custom then? Tracy, and the customs are alone involved in the clearance process, even though it's them we tend to talk about.
