Frightened staff members and nurses then summoned the police to the ward to restrain the enraged patient. On the arrival of the cops on the ward, the man was seen behaving in a boisterous manner, armed with a metal pipe in his hand. Radio Jamaica News was informed that the police immediately gave him repeated instructions to desist from his behaviour and to drop the object, but he refused and reportedly advanced towards them in a threatening manner. He was then shot three times in the upper body. The 55-year-old was then rushed to the accident and emergency department for treatment. He's now under police guard facing criminal charges. The teenager was treated for her injuries. Prince Moore, Radio Jamaica News.
