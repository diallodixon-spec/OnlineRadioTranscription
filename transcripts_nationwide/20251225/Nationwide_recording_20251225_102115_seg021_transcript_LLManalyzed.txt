20251225 102115 It's been a blue holiday, cause I'm missing you I keep wishing, wondering if you'd think of me So I listen, when the bells start to ring and my heart starts to sing I'll listen to the bells and they make me remember When we were so in love it was only last year, this time in December I'll listen to those bells and I wear my nails I hear those Christmas bells But I never knew that I could miss you like this Ready, set, uh-huh Come on
