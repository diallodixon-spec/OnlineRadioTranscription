20251223 191309 I was guilty for charges, doing this grace. But Jesus, with His special love, saved me by His grace. He pleaded, and He pleaded. He pleaded my case. I was so glad. Jesus, drop the charges. Yes, he did. Jesus, dropped the charges. Now I'm saved through grace and faith. I was guilty, guilty for so long, so long, and sinned too long. But Jesus, Jesus, with a special love, special love, gave me a brand new song. I'm so glad.
