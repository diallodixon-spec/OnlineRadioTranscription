20251225 101913 so we traded in the wish list of all the things we've never needed we should remember how blessed we are we don't need lights we don't need snow we've got the faith and we've got the hope And through the years we don't have to wait Because it's Christmas everyday And when you're here the angels sing Let the love in your heart be the gift you bring Let's put a smile on someone's face Now it's Christmas every day Hanging up the Christmas lights, everything's so bright That'd be a Christmas gig, I'm on my soul just right
