She say she want a good life No one to cross her pain and strife She want a good life, no man to cross her pain And strife She don't want no unsteady relationship One with a rock like a rocking ship Wanna love that steady as can be One that brings back memories She want a good life, no mind to cross her pain and strife Watch this! Forever, I will love you Forever, I will be true Forever, I'll always be here right by your side Every morning I'll be there When you open your eyes Never gonna let you down
