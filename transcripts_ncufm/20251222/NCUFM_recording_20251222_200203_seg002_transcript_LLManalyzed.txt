20251222 200203 Sometimes I feel so lonely And no one ever got this walking with me I say one set of footprints and I say It was God always carrying me Don't call me out yet, I'm still running I felt I'm better than God at fighting My eyes are on God's kingdom always And I won't stop until I finish this race Don't hang me out yet, I'm still running Well done, but I gotta fight it My eyes are in God's kingdom always and I won't stop till I finish this race Say you're never alone You're never alone God sees and hears that you cry Don't worry, it's gonna be alright This ain't as impossible All we've got is possible
