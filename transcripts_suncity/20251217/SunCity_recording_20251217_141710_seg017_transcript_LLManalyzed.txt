I'm just so tired of fighting for you Oh girl, I just can't take the pain You bring me every day So baby girl, I'm leaving till the morning I'll give everything to you Just can't beat you So baby girl I'm leaving town in the morning You don't like your function too much And you hate till assumption Girl, misery in me is on the highway When you put your fear in on someone It is a hurtful feeling When you find out where the mama next one Did I not give you love and affection? You bring me every day. So baby girl, I'm leaving down the road.
