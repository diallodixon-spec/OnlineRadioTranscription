20251230 091910 that is keeping us and sustaining us for over the years with our godless behavior and are are are just alright alright and you are going to tell me that the money too good to put some churches up for when when the politicians fail them right when they fail them and them don't come through and them have to run and go upon them knee city to church to pray and ask pastor for pray or provide for them. Do you know the work that churches do? Not because them don't move and parade like politicians and take pictures and photo and show. You know how I know? You know, because you're a part of the church and I see the work that churches do. Let me get let me get a point in. This has nothing to do with the spirituality of it all. I talk about the work too. And I'm getting there. Thank the
