20251224 091914 Hebrews 13 verse 5 reminds us keep your lives free from the love of money and be content with what you have because God has said never will I leave you never will I forsake you God has already assured us of his presence he has already promised that he will never leave us nor forsake us so why can't we be content with what he provides? Is it that we don't recognize that what we have has been provided by him? That every meal, every breath, every opportunity is already a gift? Or maybe we just don't trust God enough to believe that he will provide what we all need. The truth is, more is a moving target. No matter how much we gain, the world stretches further ahead, always out of reach.
