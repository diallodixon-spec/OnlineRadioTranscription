The issue of wastewater running from a plaza into the Moran Bay Square in St. Thomas is being flagged for action by pedestrians and motorists. The residents told Radio Jamaica News that the green-colored water is causing serious environmental and health concerns, and that immediate action is needed. The residents are appealing to National Water Commission, NWC, and the St. Thomas Municipal Corporation to move quickly to investigate and address the issue. The residents suggested inadequate wastewater management and lack of a proper drainage system as possible causes. And that's Headline News at this time. I'm Daniel Thompson. Next to schedule at Newscast, there's a major news at 12.
