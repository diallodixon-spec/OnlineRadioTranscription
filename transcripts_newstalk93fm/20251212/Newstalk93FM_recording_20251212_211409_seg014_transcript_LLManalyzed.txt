I can put my heart up. Unplug the alarm now. Show you want my car now. I don't need a rich bitch to somebody that can make me feel safe. I don't want a couple, but nobody ever made me feel safe like you because when i'm with you i just know i'm fine no i'm fine you take all the pressure off my mind all the time patient and time will not be going out my mind safe from the problems i don't worry
