============================================================

Thank you to Little London in the parish of Westmoreland, where a brand new police station has opened its is the new, modern, fit-for-purpose Little London Police Station. This police station, God forbid any future disaster, is built for sustainability and resilience. It will have its own backup power. It is built strong and it will be able to serve this community as an area that you would consider to be a first responder.
