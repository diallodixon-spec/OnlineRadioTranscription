============================================================

We let ourselves down there in the back end, especially with the foundation that we had in the beginning. The Openers laid a very good foundation for us. King came in and made an impact straight away, getting a great start, 6-6 or so I thought it was, if I remember correctly. Like I said, we let ourselves down a bit in the back end and put too much pressure on the lower order this time around but credit still must be given to good bowling and good bowlers so yeah we still got to look at a few areas there with the batter we can put a better first and then score to set the game up for us. And that is West Indies batsman Shea Hope. Scores in the match so far West Indies 205 New Zealand 24 without loss. Australia captain Pat Cummings will return for what could be a decisive third ashes test against England at Adelaide next week. The fast bowler missed the first two tests which Australia won because of a back problem.
