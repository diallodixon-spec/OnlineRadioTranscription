20251225 192018 Someone come and rescue me Cause you are my mind, it's got me losing it I'm lost, it got me looking for the rest of me And though it's tempting me now it's over me Just a presence and a second, there's my sanity Yes, yes, unless I need some bangs for my vanity My time is up and that's what I'm gonna see I get so hot because the sun is out the door Can't seem to find the light Take me home, you know you said you'd be there, right? Take me home, I can't just, you bring me on tonight I'm out, what do you got me in? I don't believe you You keep me hanging on the way you make me feel S.O.S. please, someone help me Take my selfie, for me to feel that you're right
