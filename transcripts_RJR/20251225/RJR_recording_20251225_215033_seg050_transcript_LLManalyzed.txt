20251225 215033 I'll never see you around anymore Another year has passed and I can't erase The memories of your smiling face So I've got to call you up and say Gee whiz, it's Christmas Everybody come jump up up up So don't forget the party that we're throwing The warm fire from the fireplace will be glowing It's been a long, long time Can't figure out why you crossed my mind
