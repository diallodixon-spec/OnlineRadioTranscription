20251224 094631 and sometimes a shabby exterior can house a unique little treasure. Some years ago, my husband Scott and I had our third child. We were going to stop having children after two but the Lord seemed to continually nudge me about having one more. Finally, I told Scott about this gnawing in my heart to have a baby. I would be 37 years old and I was growing fairly comfortable with the way things were. So this would require some amount of change for us. Scott suggested that we pursue God's will and within a few months I was pregnant. Over the next nine months Scott and I prayed earnestly for a healthy baby and for a smooth delivery, but deep in my spirit I sensed something would be different this time around. I wasn't sure what, but I knew the child I was carrying was the result of our obedience to God.
