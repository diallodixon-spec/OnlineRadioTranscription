20251224 103522 Welcome to Jumptown, baby. It's we at the Jumptown Jammin'. It's we at Jumptown Jammin'. It's local people in the streets Chippin' down a lane It's how we break with the chain Come and taste our freedom, sweetie When you want your ways Look how you have in the places Hot and groovy Look what music could do it It's happy in a jam again Feel like a movie When you throw it back on me I feel nauseous again Every dirty night I want to be with you
