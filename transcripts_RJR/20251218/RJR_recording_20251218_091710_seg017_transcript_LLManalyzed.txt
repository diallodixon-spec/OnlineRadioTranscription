Thank you so much to Laska Manufacturing for the beverages and the support that you have given us. Dairy Industries, RG Cares, they've donated $50,000 towards the building materials. Thank you so much, Mr. Gary Allen and the team there. By a regeneration at 15 Haining Road, where you know I go there for my vitamin infusions that I've told you about, and Dr. Janice Simmons-Fisher has donated 75,000 to the rebuilding effort. Thank you as well to a member of the judiciary who contributes every year and wishes to remain anonymous, but that individual contributed $30,000 yesterday, and that has been put in the kitty, and building materials have been redeemed from H&L for that particular sum. On location as well, you know it's Christmas, so I'm going to bake
