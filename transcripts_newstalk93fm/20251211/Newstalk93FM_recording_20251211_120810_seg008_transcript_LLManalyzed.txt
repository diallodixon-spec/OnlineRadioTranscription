We're not feeling under the weather You just make me feel sweet Ice the cocoa tea, use the sugar Hang together, we are complete, darling Heat me up Only you alone can put fire back in the soul Heat me up And they're telling me I should leave that fire alone When the more they tell me's the more I holdin' you close I could never let you go
