20251225 195844 I should be happy, but I just wanna cry. Cause those gifts that you bought me are still under the tree. I should tear them up just like you did to me. I lost my love on Christmas night It hurts, it hurts at the same time Bout to be a new year, a new state of mind But it's like hell right now Cause you're not around on Christmas night. Christmas time.
