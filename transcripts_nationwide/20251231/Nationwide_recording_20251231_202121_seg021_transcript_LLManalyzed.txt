20251231 202121 Uh, all my exes live in Texas like I'm George Strait Or they go to Georgia State where Tuition is handled by some random **** that live in Atlanta Then she only see what she feels obligated Admitted it to me the first time we dated But she was no angel and we never waited I took her for sushi, she wanted it So we took it to go, told them don't even plate it And we never talked too much after I blew up Just only hello her, happy belated And I think I texted and told her I made it And that's when she texted me and told me she ****ed in in And that's when I texted and told her I love her Then right after texting and told her I'm faded She asked, what have I learned since getting richer I learned working with the negatives to make for better pictures I learned Hennessy and enemies is one hell of a mixture Even though it's girl I'm still just a bitch, damn Is it the fall? It's time for me to revisit the past Since women have called us, I used to drive this liquor, involved in stories to tell. We've been through it all. Interviews are like confessions. My dressing room confuses me with questions like, do you love it? Are you right now? Do you ever get nervous? Are you single?
