20251226 210103 I was wrong and I just can't live without you All day long I'm wearing a mask of false bravado Trying to keep up a smile that hides a tear But as the sun goes down get that empty feeling again I wish to God that you were here baby come back any kind of fool could see there was something in everything about you Baby come back, you can blame it all on me I was wrong and I just can't live without you
