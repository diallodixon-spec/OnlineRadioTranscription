20251226 094743 Since you've been gone I've been hanging around healing you You fill my mind with sin Can't you hear my call? I try to clear my mind You even help me I guess I'm on the spot now, babe As soon as I jump into my room Those memories start to play So don't hold the radio And tear you up, baby, won't stop It's just another sad love song Breaking my brain'm crazy I'm all torn up baby, fast or slow It doesn't let go, I'm shedding And it's all because of you
