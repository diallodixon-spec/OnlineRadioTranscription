20251224 091413 It's that time of year When good friends are dear And you wish you could give more Than just presents from a store Why don't you give love on Christmas Day? Oh, even the man who has everything Would be so happy if you would bring Him love on Christmas Day On Christmas Day No greater gift is there than love People you don't know Smile and not hello Everywhere there's an air of Christmas joy
