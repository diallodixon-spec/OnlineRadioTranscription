20251230 120721 Lord it's been a long time since I've called on your name Without you things are just not the same Thought I could handle this on my own But the truth is I'm straying further from home You see the devil has it in his plans To destroy all good visions in this land But Lord please forgive us I pray Because we wanna see you someday Please give us the chance to go through these temptations The devil has planted in this imponation Provide us the knowledge, cancel limitations Separation, frustration, we need your salvation
