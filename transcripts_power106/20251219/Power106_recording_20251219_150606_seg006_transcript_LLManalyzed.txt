You've been selling for morning, okra, sweet pepper, salad tomato, beetroot, cabbage, cucumber, melon, onions, both red and white onion, lettuce, yellow yam is the only yellow yam you have? Yeah. The best yam anyway because that's the one that I love. You have sweet and Irish potato. You have oranges. Thyme. Yes, that is very good. And do you marry the thyme to the scallion? Or people can come and get thyme alone.
