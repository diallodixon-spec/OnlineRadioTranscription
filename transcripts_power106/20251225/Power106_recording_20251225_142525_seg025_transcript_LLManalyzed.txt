20251225 142525 Must be you Must be you So I listen When the bells start a-ringin' My heart starts singin' I listen to the bells And they make me remember When we were so in love It was only last year, this time in December. I listen to the bells that I reminisce. I hear those Christmas bells, but I never knew that I could miss you like this. Lovers, lights and everything under the tree. Hands come around, celebrate, celebrate. They have a good time, but it's not a party for me. Call up, do. Stand up, do.
