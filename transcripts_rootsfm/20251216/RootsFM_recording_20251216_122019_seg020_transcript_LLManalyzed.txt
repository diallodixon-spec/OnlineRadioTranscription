20251216 122019 A greater person than us is coming who is baptizing with spirit and fire. Number three and the last one. John is reminding us, listen to the inner voice. There is an inner voice crying in the wilderness. There is a voice telling you, this is right, that is wrong. There is the voice telling you that it's not right anymore. Listen to that voice. Our consciousness is the inner voice of God. It is the voice crying in the wilderness. There is something in your life you know is not right anymore. You will have to set boundaries to do better, to make the way straight.
