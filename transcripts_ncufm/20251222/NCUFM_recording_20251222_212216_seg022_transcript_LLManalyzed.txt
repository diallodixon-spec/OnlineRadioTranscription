20251222 212216 I'm still here Nobody's gonna take me away, Lord I'm still here I may not have money I may not have fame But Lord, I'm still here No body times when I feel this courage To the point where I just feel like giving up. I'm still holding on, Lord. I'm still holdin' on, Lord, I'm still holding up. Yes, yes, yes, yes. I am still holding on. March onward, never give up.
