20251225 101208 throughout the whole year. In your home, at work, at school, far away, show love this Christmas time. This is Don Topping of Radio 2 FM and the RGR Communications Group wishing you the most musical and merriest Christmas you've ever had. I'm Henry Sennett from RGR 94 FM and I'd just like to take this opportunity to wish for you and yours a Merry Christmas and all the best for the New Year. It is my wish for all Jamaicans that peace and tranquility will last us through the season and beyond. I am Norma Brown Bell. We don't have no snow, we don't have no sleigh, but I tell you we're gonna have fun when Christmas comes in J.A. It's Christmas time, and Dr. Love says, have a very Merry Christmas. Hi, I'm Simon Croskill, really wishing you a very Merry Christmas,
