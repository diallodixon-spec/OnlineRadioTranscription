============================================================

I feel like a running tongue again Jump and shake the ground again We're with one another never No place like home, home, home Now is the perfect place. Look where we are. Great is gonna buy. So magical. It's a blessing sent from above. And we could jump till morning. Look, the moon's gone sleeping. Tell them we're not leaving.
