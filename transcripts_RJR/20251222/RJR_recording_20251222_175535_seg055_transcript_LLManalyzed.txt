20251222 175535 to Santa Cruz to help us clean up the field. So, yeah, I think we got a lot of help from the people around in the area. Was there... Sorry, people, frog in my throat. Coach, was there ever a point when you or the team or the school say, boy, this is so much, can we really do it? No, you know, to be honest, no, we never give up, never lose our focus, we never lose the faith that is gonna start. So, you know, all we're singing is for the competition to resume. And as I hear Malik talk about KC coming down the hill, KC actually, I don't know how to thank them, Coach Basel and the crew, you know. KC went on the field to get the field cleaned up. That's when we actually get back our football dream up and running because, you know, they take the time from Kingston to come here to help us.
