But you you you would appreciate though from your economics that it's a mix managing holding inflation. It's a policy mix and sometimes you get the mix the right balance. Sometimes you don't. Mm hmm. Yeah. And it's it't. And it's not a pure science. One plus one equals two. It is, as I said, a mix.

They're not the best people to manage inflation.
