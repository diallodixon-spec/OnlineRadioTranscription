20260102 155724 My baby said he loved me My baby had it easy Got to touch, kiss and please me all night and day Remember when we did after the cabo 24 hours and we took it to the shelter How does it feel to do it on your own? Listen, babe. My baby's alone, and it's bad. Fingertip on the edge. He left me for good, but he regrets leaving me. He's leaving me. And I hope it hurts like hell And I hope it hurt like hell You shouldn't ever let me go I know I'm messing up your mind The devil got you good this time And I hope it's hurts like hell
