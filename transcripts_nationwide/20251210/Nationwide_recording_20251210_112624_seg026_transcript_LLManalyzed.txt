============================================================

These are events that will be in communities that were harvested by the hurricanes. So, you know, kids and families can look up for things like Digisanto. We have gifts. We're doing warm meals. We have entertainment and share packages for persons who need it the most. And I have to give a special shout out to people like True Juice and mothers who are partnering with us to bring that to life. Excellent. How do people enter? So can give the plan with easy double entry. You can top up with $500 or more. Activate any prime plan. Make a call for a minute or longer by anything or phone. By the way, we have hands-free offers happening with Christmas as well. You can get a Samsung Smartphone that's worth $95 plus tax. And of course, you know, just be an active post-paid or Digital Plus customer. And by the way, if you happen to be on another network and you want to come over to this site, if you switch to Digital or stand up at Digital Plus, you're also going to be able to enter. Excellent.
