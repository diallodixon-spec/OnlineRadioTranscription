**Exclusive Interview: Dennis Chung, Chief Technical Director of the Financial Investigations Division, Shares His Thoughts on Recent Controversies**

In a recent interview, Dennis Chung, the Chief Technical Director of the Financial Investigations Division (FID), sat down with a radio host to discuss his experiences and thoughts on the recent controversies surrounding his appointment to the position. Chung, who was previously the General Secretary of the Jamaica Football Federation, has been at the center of a media storm, with many questioning his suitability for the role.

When asked about the protests and criticisms he faced, Chung remained calm and composed, stating that he never held a grudge against those who opposed him. "I think people were just acting in their roles," he said. "It was a time of politics." He also acknowledged that the protests and criticisms did have an impact on him, but he chose not to dwell on them.

Chung also spoke about his qualifications for the position, highlighting his accounting background and experience in financial investigations. "I have always thought that accounting strength is one of the most important strengths to have in an organization," he said. "As an accountant, you know every single thing that's happening in an organization."

The interview also touched on the topic of the Prime Minister's business and the referral to the FID. Chung stated that he had recused himself from the decision-making process and had not been informed of the status of the investigation. "I don't deal with it," he said. "It is dealt with by one of the directors in there."

When asked about the perception that the quality of investigation of financial crimes in Jamaica is lacking, Chung strongly disagreed. "That's false," he said. "The great majority of our cases, we're successful in. The investigative ability of people in this country is very good, and we get international ratings from overseas agencies about our approach."

Chung also expressed his faith in civil society and their role as a check and balance on happenings in the democracy. "I think civil society is critical," he said. "I have faith in them. I think that people might express their different opinions, but as I said, it's important for us to have these differences and debates."

Throughout the interview, Chung demonstrated his commitment to his role and his passion for Jamaica. When asked if he had ever thought about giving up, he replied, "No, I'll tell you right. One of my biggest passions has always been Jamaica. I thought that it was very necessary for me to go there and show that there was a system in place."

The interview provided a unique insight into the thoughts and experiences of Dennis Chung, a man who has been at the center of controversy in recent months. Despite the challenges he has faced, Chung remains committed to his role and is determined to make a positive impact on Jamaica.
