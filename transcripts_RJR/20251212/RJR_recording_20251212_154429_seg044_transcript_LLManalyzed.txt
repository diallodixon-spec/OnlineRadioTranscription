20251212 154429 race engineers, stewards, commentators, the scope of what we're trying to achieve is not even just the fastest drivers but a complete and comprehensive form for racing to grow and it's slowly transitioning into grassroots racing now. Max Verstappen, four-time world champion of Formula One, almost missed it by two points, he believes in sim racing. He believes it as a means of developing talent and showing that you don't just have to have millions of dollars. You can come in and if you're doing a good job, you can transition into real life and make a name for yourself in a sport that you would love. Excellent. Thank you so much for speaking with us, Stuart. If people want to get in touch with you, how do they find you? How do they link with their SIM crew? Again, thank you for the opportunity as well. Again, we have an Instagram channel at JSRA Official, JSRA as in Jamaica Simulation.
