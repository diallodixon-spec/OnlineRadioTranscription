20251231 193530 Rose Robinson Hall, there was this case recently of a father who not only sexually assaulted his daughter, he started doing so in one case at age 12 and another before that when she was in grade 5 and then also involved in trafficking in having his friend come over paid for the act and also inviting schoolboys that one i think has shocked a lot of well-thinking jamaicans yes yes and i ask you you as the experienced most experienced here is, if not rare? What I can tell you from my experience is that the perpetrators are usually people, adults, who are close to the children. So that a father should do that is not strange.
