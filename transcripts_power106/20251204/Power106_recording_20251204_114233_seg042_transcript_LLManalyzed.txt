I heard that the figure is now between 360 and 390 Whereas the initial amount we were told is 350 then we were told about the Electricity Disaster Fund which would afford JPS 50 million so the required amount was 300 then we were told by the Minister of Finance that there's 450 in the the loan. Then we are told that that's actually not the loan money that comes from the motivational 2.4 billion which is afforded. But then yesterday they said that there is no guarantee that JPS can get any loan from it. So basically they're saying it is available for them to apply. Nothing has been approved to JPS. Yet they are there saying that the JPS, the minister gave the impression that JPS was covered under the money to come. So when we asked, okay, so what are the terms, they said that is not a commitment.
