20251225 213528 That you felt in your life And it cuts like a knife But remember to look for tomorrow It's not long now Put some love in your heart Put some heart in your love And don't let the doubts steer you wrong There'll be something out of nothing When love comes along You wanna have it all But to get to the light You gotta get through the night Don't let them hold you back now You're already there Put some love in your heart Put some heart in your love
