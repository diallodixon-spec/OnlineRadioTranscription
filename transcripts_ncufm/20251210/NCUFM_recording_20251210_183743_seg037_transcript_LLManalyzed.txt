people in Jamaica will listen to you. Listen to your word. Listen to how you speak to the conscience. How you speak to the mind. So touch down this evening and touch every citizen, every resident, every man, every woman, every boy, every girl, every leader in this country and speak, O God. Speak as Osamuels responded to Eli speak Lord thy son Eret Lord we just pray this evening that you will have your own sweet way as we listen to you and as we submit all to you we pray that we will be willing and ready to do your will because as we're willing and ready to Do your will all your power is ours So we pray you know that you will give us a willing heart give our leaders a willing heart to follow what the Bible says to
