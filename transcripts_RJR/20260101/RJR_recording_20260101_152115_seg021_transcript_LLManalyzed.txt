20260101 152115 I remember when he was living with my cousins, there was an old piano. And my older cousin, she used to play the piano. I think she did some music lessons. So she showed me a few things on the piano. And I would just look at the book and try and pick things out. But my grandmother used to say, I can see a lot of music, and I'm going to send you for some lessons. but it never happened. So how music came to be, really, was thinking out in high school and my friends at high school, Alpha Academy, bigger Alpha, my friends there encouraging me and saying, you know, you sound good, you must enter some of our, you know, competitions and things like that. But I was always very shy, I still am. So it was just something that I used to do, as I said, to amuse myself and comfort myself. So I didn't feel comfortable on stage doing music. But yeah, that wasn't me. But I loved acting, funnily enough.
