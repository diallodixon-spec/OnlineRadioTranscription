20251229 091510 I have a lightning spirit Early in the morning I hat it Me cooler ready, me heist done ready Me punching that's automatic I have a lightning jumbie A kind of energy inside me And it ready for the rum Ready, ready for the rum, ready, ready, go It's action time, let we go, it's bacchanal time Let we go. Hands up. This sweating spirit of me feeling good.
