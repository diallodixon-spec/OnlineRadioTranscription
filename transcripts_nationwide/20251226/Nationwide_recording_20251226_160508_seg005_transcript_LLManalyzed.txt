20251226 160508 And watching me fall apart But I won't wait till the end Of time for you And do it again It's true Don't you know? Cause I can't measure my love There's nothing to compare it to But I want you to know that if I could fly I'd be given up, I'd take you into the light And show you the light you've never seen And you'll never see again
