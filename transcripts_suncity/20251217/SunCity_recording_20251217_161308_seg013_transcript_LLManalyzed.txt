20251217 161308 Big, big tune, I'm mashing up the As I'm working and working everyday Got to get down to the struggle someday Get to get, get to get out. Right to the point, I give thanks and I fail. Get to it, get out to get out. Got to get down to the struggles some day. We've got to, we've got to. I see hope for the future, success and hope.
