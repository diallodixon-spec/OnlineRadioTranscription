I hear a honey hesitation of a heart that's never really sure Can't keep on trying if you're looking for more Than all that I could give you Than what you came here for Gonna find me somebody I'm not afraid to let go Wanna know how to beat that condiment You came real close But every time you build me up You only let me down But everybody knows, everybody knows Almost doesn't count, almost doesn't count Hey, hey, nobody knows Hey, hey, yeah, yeah, yeah
