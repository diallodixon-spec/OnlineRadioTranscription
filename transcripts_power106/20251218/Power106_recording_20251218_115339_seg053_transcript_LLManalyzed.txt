Unfortunately, a lot of the mature trees were completely destroyed. We have taken all the Scotch body cover seeds that were at boulders, that were distributed them free free and also the seedlings. But we probably won't see stabilization of that until towards the end of next year. There are other things like a YAMM that would take about a year to get us back, 18 months to get us back to where we were. So it doesn't mean that they'll have a complete absence, but in terms of getting back to the level where we were three months up, it will take us 12 to 18 months. Our bananas, we expect about 7 to 9 months.
