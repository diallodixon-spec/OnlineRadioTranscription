Because the FTC said that there was a one-year ban and the ban does stifle competition because as you just said they reach in a minute and they can't go anywhere while your members are. So the FTC is misleading the public? No, I think, I don't know who is misleading the public because I know there was a short stop order on them by the minister and then the minister resumed talks with them. We have had a few meetings with the officials, I think with the local officials but since then we have never heard nothing more from the minister and the super engine group. They are still working within the space. Okay, so there was no ban then? There's no ban on them.
