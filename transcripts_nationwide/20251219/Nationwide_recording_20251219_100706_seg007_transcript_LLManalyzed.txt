20251219 100706 And I held firm to what I felt was right like a rock Like a rock I was strong as I could be like a rock Nothing ever got to me like a rock I was something to see like a rock And I stood arrow straight Unencumbered by the weight of all these hustlers and their schemes I stood proud, I stood tall Welcome back, welcome back, welcome back. Thank you so much for sticking and staying with us live.
