You ain't got no shame, I'm proud Come and say make your way in the ghetto Santa Claus is coming to the ghetto So you got to have some fun On the first day of the year, you'll meet the sons of love Say make your way, in the ghetto I will tell you about the sound, I'll lead the way The ghetto is a bitch when you look into it, you live into it, they say they just can't. Santa Claus is coming to town, say with his mouth full of time, they say they got to jump for John.
