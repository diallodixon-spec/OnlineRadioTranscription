You know, I dealt with you the nicest Nobody touched me in the righteous Nobody touched me in a crisis I believe that all of your dreams are durations You took my heart, all my keys, all my patience You took my heart all my sleep, all my decorations You mistaken my love for property proper you for foundation All that I wanted from you was to give me Something that I never had Something that you never seen Something that you never think But I wake up and nothing's wrong Just get ready for work work work work work Work to me I be work work work work You see me do me dirt dirt dirt dirt do, do-do-do-do You saw me, but I work, work, work-work-work-work When you walk out, na-na-na-na Before the tables turn, turn, turn-turn-turn-turn
