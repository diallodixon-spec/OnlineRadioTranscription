============================================================

I'm all alone, still you go. I was telling a lie. Are you satisfied? No one is here with bright shine of tonight. I'm all alone. Still you go. I'm telling a lie. Pretty little woman, you don't trust me no more. You don't have to break down my door. I'm all alone. Come inside and you will see there's no one here but me. Told you I'd soon be over. Still you refuse to believe it. Are you satisfied? Why don't you just open your eyes? Oh, I know cheese people, I was telling a lie Are you satisfied? No one's with me tonight
