20251212 102210 I don't know what to do. I don't know how to do it. I don't even know what to do with my life. Money making got me out of touch. Ain't flesh to smile in a long way. An unexpected birth worth set of ghetto chaps. My attitude got me walking solo. Ride all alone in my lolo. Watching the whole world moving slow mo. But by the time I disappear, listen to the ocean. Smoking points take my thoughts, then it's back to toasting. When I trust in this cold world, my phony homie had a baby by my old girl. But I ain't trippin', I'm a player, I ain't sweatin' him My sexy sister had a moment like his next again No remorse, it was meant to happen Besides rappin', only thing I did good was swappin' Until the end of time So take these broken wings I need your hands to come and heal me once again So I can fly, till we end up tonight. Please take these broken wings. Put your hands up, come and hear me once again.
