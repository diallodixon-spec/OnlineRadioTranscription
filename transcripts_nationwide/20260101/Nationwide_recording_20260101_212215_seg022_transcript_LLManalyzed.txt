20260101 212215 I feel the rush Oh, did it in the air Keep on moving it forward and live with no fear Feel the rush oh, feel it everywhere Keep on moving it forwards and live with no fair Feel the rush, I say buckle up Feel it up, select, I pull it, juggle up One time, come again, make a double up Pick up the you and let it struggle up Yo! Make me more, say we'll more survive We'll feel alive, nobody can't breathe We strike the compromise, say let me come and reach the sky Every time you hear it, come and feel the rush Oh, feel it in me, yeah Keep on moving it forward and look with no fear
