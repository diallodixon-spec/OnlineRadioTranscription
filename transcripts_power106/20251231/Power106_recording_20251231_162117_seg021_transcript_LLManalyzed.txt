20251231 162117 What are you doing for these people, Minister? Are you going to put them in shelter? That's a question I want to know. Until we can do temporary things where we can talk about it. Because we have one thing about emergency. We have to go from critical to not so critical to less critical. I think women and children are very critical. I think elders are critical.

So, Minister, what are you doing about these people right now? Right now, not tomorrow, not whatever. And you talk about people of country, you know, we're doing greater than the world country. And I'm just going to say to you, Minister, don't use FEMA as an example because FEMA is terrible.
