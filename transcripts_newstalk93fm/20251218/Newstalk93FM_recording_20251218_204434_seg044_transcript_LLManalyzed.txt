20251218 204434 Our souls connected, we knew right away Every moment, every single road led you to me You love me so, never gonna let you go You want the world to know, an answer to my prayers Loving you so now, louder than the loudest thunder like a prayer elevates holy love takes us where we belong nothing else matters when we are together all our cares are gone Seems like time stops, all our fears drop It's the way it should be It's a sure shot, hit the jackpot Come closer to me, yeah
