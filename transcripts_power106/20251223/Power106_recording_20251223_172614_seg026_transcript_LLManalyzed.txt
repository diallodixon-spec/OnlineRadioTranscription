20251223 172614 away in terms of the revenue of the licensed public transport operators in this country and especially in Kingston and St. Catharines. In addition to that, you know, that the JUTC now no longer have license for the KMTR, you know, by law, but they now have license for right across Jamaica. So they can pick buses anywhere the taxi is. There's a JOTC bus now. They're going to Ocho Rios, they're going to Montego Bay, and they're going all over the place. So you can imagine when you have a highest bus coming from Kingston to Maypen, taking 14, 15 passengers. But now you have a JOTC buses on the same route taking 50, 60 passengers. And the same passengers, the same piece of bread, a loaf of bread, sorry, that everybody's pinching from. So we are losing at least 25% for daily income because of this arrangement.
