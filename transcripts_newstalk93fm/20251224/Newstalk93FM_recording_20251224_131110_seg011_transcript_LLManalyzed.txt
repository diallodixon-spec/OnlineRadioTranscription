20251224 131110 Like yourself, like yourself, like yourself What's in the party done? Why don't you try to run the line? And you don't try to stop me vibe, so don't say You do what you want, I do what I like You ain't have to get no shit Cause when it comes to party, I ain't such a man And I know when we come to party, we don't have a piece You don't't tell me why not who I want to go. Why not who you like, y'all know your want Why don't know your life, why don't know your love like yourself like yourself like yourself until we party don't stop You know your wants, you know your wants
