============================================================

Men might not only speak of your provision in easing and relieving the temporary needs of life, but we can also rejoice gloriously in you saving us from sin. So Lord, thank some mercy. The way we have been in the ritual, Lord, as we go to work, should tomorrow be loan unto us, Master. It is our resolve to lay whole upon you. And the open of hearts by your mercies even more, that more mercy can be poured. Tomorrow, as we go about, we can be your merciful servants. For this we say with thanksgiving. In Jesus name. Amen. Jesus.
