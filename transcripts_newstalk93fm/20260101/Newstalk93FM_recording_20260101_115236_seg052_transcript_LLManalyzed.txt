20260101 115236 Take a ride Let me blow your mind Ride it from the passenger's side It's like that, yo I got the sweet and the spice And everything nice It's like that yo I got the hen and the lime With the cream on the side I hate it when you have to leave But I don't say a thing Cause I will absolutely get it nice. I'm gonna give it time And I'ma keep it nice, nice, neat, neat Sugar, sugar, sweet Can we keep it nice?
