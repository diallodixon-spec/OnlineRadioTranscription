20251231 124531 Kiss me, beneath the milky twilight Lead me, out on the moonlit floor Lift your open hand, strike up the band And make the fireflies dance, the silver moon sparking So kiss me I don't want another hard way I don't need another turn to cry No, I don't want to learn the hard way Baby hello, oh no, goodbye But you got me like a rocket Shooting straight across the sky It's the way you love me It's a feeling like this It's centrifugal motion It's perpetual bliss It's that pivotal moment It's impossible
