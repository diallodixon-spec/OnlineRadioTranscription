2025-12-12 08:54:15 I can't sleep. I'm stressing all the time. I can't sleep because I'm always on the grind. My body's not keep up. Take your troubles and throw them all away. Get ready to run across the stage. Get ready. your head. Give me energy, real energy. I felt it so crazy, my therapy. Therapy, my therapy. It took away all of my anxiety. Anxiety, my remedy. I tell you that we all need love.
