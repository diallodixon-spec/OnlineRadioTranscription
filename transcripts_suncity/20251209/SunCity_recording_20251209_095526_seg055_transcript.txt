Listen, Dr Harvey from you tell me that last week I went home that night and I tried to count how much choose me I do and I tried to you know not have anything on the TV or on my phone and just enjoy the meal and You know, it was an experience but why it didn't last too long but I'll try to always try and remember to just chew as much as possible because when you really check it, you know You must cut and swallow because you chew maybe chew maybe three times four times the most and then you're swallowing the food So it's so important. So since speaking to you, I'm definitely more mindful But when you were saying I think you said that meats did you say meats was up to a hundred chews? No, how much you say for meats or 20 for meats when you're eating meats because I remember that one had a lot of chewing in it the number of chewing how much should you say for the meats again a hundred times yeah you did say a hundred yeah yeah yes
