20251224 120101 us throughout the year for your listening preference, despite so many other choices that exist in the broadcast landscape. 2026 promises to be an exciting year for the station as we introduce new programs to facilitate your needs as well as more engagement while on air. Yesterday's Roots FM was good, and we aim to make tomorrow's Roots FM even better as we continuously reimagine, recreate, and redesign according to your desires. And while we give thanks, let us remember those close by who may not be as fortunate as we are, as well as our brothers and sisters in Western Jamaica who are struggling through the season because of Hurricane Melissa.
