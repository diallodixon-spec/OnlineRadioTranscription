20260102 100807 I often tell you that I'm 37 years old, yeah? And for the entirety of that time, certainly as long as I have consciously followed news and current affairs, I've taken it as a given that more than 1,000 Jamaicans would be murdered in this country. I thought that was just a fact of life. It was just something to live with. But 2025 told me, it told all of us actually, that it isn't. That we do not have to normalize murdering more than 1,000 Jamaicans every year. And when I was asked to sit in this chair and I reflected on the massive reduction in murders and thought about what I wanted to say to you this morning as we embark on a new year, I realized that I want us, all of us as Jamaican people, to dare to dream.
