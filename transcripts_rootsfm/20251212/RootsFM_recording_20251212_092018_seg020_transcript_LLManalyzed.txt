2025-12-12 10:57:58 I'll be standing tall Oh Lord, please forgive me Cause they know not what they do Lord, I'll walk with you Oh, I need you here beside me all the way I know I'm not worthy But I'm crying to you for your love. On my knees, I come before you now. Father, please protect my soul somehow. Oh Lord, please forgive me. Oh, have mercy on my soul. God, please take control. Because I need you here beside me.
