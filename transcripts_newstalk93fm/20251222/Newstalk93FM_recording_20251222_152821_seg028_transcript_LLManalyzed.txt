20251222 152821 Make me swig, make me harder Make me lose my breath, make me water Make me swig Make me harder Make me loose my breath Make me water Hopefully, you can last all night Don't get too excited Privacy You ain't gotta go nowhere, you can stay inside it Can you blow my mind? Set off my whole body If I give you my time Can you stretch my soul from it? I don't wanna wait. Come take it. Take me where I ain't been before. Can you blow my mind? Set off my heart.
