Our bread, fruit, our turkey for Christmas dinner Down in Jamaica, there's hot summerly weather And people are warm and friendly all the time Now it's that Christmas season and they're funky and dumb So have a joyful iry Christmas in the sun! Look up on me, don't mean a nothing to me I know I'm sorry I'm sorry, I'm sorry
