If you feel like it take me away and make it okay, I swear I'll be here You wanna control So we waited I put on a show Now I'm naked You say I'm a kid My ego is bad I don't give a s*** And it goes like this Take me by the tongue and I'll know you Kiss me till you jump and I'll show you all the moves like Jagger I've got them moves like Jagger, I've got the move like Jagger I don't need to try to control you Look into my eyes and I'll own you with them moves like Jagger
