light bursts and water theft. Over the years, NWC has partnered with the Israeli firm MIA to reduce its non-revenue water. This was initially done in the Kingston and St. Andrew region. In this area, this used to be a great deal of success, with non- revenue water averaging for the KSA just over 45%. For comparison, the country average as of 2024 is 74%. The average rate has hovered relatively unchanged over 70% since 2019. The OUI says notwithstanding major water loss reduction initiatives over the years, the data indicates that non-revenue water in the NWC's system has not moved. According to the OUI, this represents a significant financial constraint on the water commission. The gains made in the Kingston and St. Andrew area seem to be an outlier when compared to the rest of the island. As of March 2025, Hanover represents the second best performer for the NWC with a non-revenue water rate of 61%.
