I want to be my walk in my soul I must apply to the blood of Jesus I want to be by walk in my soul. I know my Lord He'll make a way for me, yes he will. I know my Lord, he'll make a way, for me, I know he will. And if I live his holy life, And try to do the right I know my heart will make a way for me
