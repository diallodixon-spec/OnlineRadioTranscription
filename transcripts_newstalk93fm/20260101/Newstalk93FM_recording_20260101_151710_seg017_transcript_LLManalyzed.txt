20260101 151710 I'm back on that, I'ma talk like this. I'm back on the, I'ma walk like this. House got a view, we gon' f*** like this. F*** your mom when I talk, b***h. F***ing Mac in the office, pull on this f***ing Mac cause I f***ed her. Like me a cool girl, I'm younger. Like a pungent, I took her pennies off her. Opposites always a try. How you happy, then get mad. But I want you bad. If she wanna make up. I'ma just tell you that this true love, gave me kidney Wrist rolled over, you mind I'm spinning I'm off to the same damn time, I can't even stay up Wrists in the freezer, I'ma catch right cause you're mine I'ma play it up, get behind you, all that, me bite that Give me my card so you swipe that It wasn't you, it's me, it ain't me, it's you All that was was hard to see Now I would've lied and lose I'd rather, I'd rather I'd rather lie then to lose you girl I'd rather lie than confuse you girl Truth is we laugh and laugh
