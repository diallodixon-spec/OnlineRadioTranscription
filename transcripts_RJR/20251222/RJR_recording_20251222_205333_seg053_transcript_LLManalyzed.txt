20251222 205333 I wanna spend quality time with you Do the things I know you love to do I want to please you if you want me to And make you feel good like never before I'd like the two of us to face the truth Can't run away from it win or lose Can't control the urge to explore this virtual feeling no doubt it can cure can you feel it feel it in your heart and soul can you feel it, feel like to lose control
