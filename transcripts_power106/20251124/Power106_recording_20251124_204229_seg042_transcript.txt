============================================================

so hard to let your feelings die. It seems like an eternity since I held you close to me. Now that we see where we went wrong, our love's become a love that's twice as strong. Now we're starting over again. It's not the easiest thing to do. I'm failing inside again. Cause every time I look at you, I know we're starting over again. This time we'll love all the pain away, from the home I love her and bring. We are starting over, over again.
