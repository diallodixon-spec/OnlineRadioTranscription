20251231 181708 Welcome back to Vibes and Verses. I am Dion Davies. We have been having a conversation with insurance broker turned poet Michael Green here on Route 96.1 FM, the voice of the inner city. And Mr. Green has been expressing his desire to impact not just one or two, but many individuals with his pieces. So now we will hear his third and final piece for takeoff. Held back, pulled back, no sign of progress, seemed to have signed a deal, living within a mess. The tension and strain seems unbearable. My goals and ambitions seem unachievable. As the heat and friction intensify, the eagle within is set, ready to fly.
