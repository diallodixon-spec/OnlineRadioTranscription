20251218 142714 I could stay lost in this moment forever. Every moment spent with you is a moment I treasure. Don't want to close my eyes. I don't want to fall asleep, cause I miss you, baby. And I don't wanna close my eyes. I don't wanna fall asleep. Cause I miss you, baby. And I don't wanna miss a thing. Cause even when I dream of you, the sweetest dream would never do. I still miss you, baby, and I don't want this thing. Lying close to you, feeling your heart beating. And I'm wondering what your dream is.
