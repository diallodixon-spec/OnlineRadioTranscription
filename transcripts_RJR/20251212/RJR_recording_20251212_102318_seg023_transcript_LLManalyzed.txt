2025-12-12 10:39:56 We have Head of Marketing at Digicel at 11.15 and 11.45. We have NCB, Casey of Vaughan there. A lot's coming up. It is Christmas this week after next week, not sure. I don't understand this year. Oh, this thing has come round so fast. Hello? Machines,, thank you. This is Neville. Alright, I normally talk about construction when I come on, but I want to talk about Mr. Curry, down by in Central Elizabeth there. Me personally, as a builder, feel uncomfortable with Mr. Curry, the way he behaves with the Prime Minister the other day.
