20251225 143220 A baby's crying Bethlehem Broke the silence of the earth A trembling sound of promise Wrapped in unexpected birth In that fragile little whisper Heaven's power came to stay the crying Bethlehem still calls my heart today. The crying Bethlehem is calling me to kneel to see the love of Jesus, the Savior who is real. The crying Bethlehem still echoes through my soul. A tiny voice of glory making broken people whole.
