She don't wanna roses She wanna have a good time Light up the chalice Under the moonlight Home is where the heart is And I'll be right here by your side You say Never had a love like this before Never had love like this Never had a love Like this before Never had a Love like this I just a sweet sensation I wish she won't take good vibration
