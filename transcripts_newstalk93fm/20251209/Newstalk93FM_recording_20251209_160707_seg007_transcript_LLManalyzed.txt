============================================================

I feel I could take a dance with my lover In the middle of the road But everywhere I look now it's precious So give me something to ease my soul Cause we need a healing And when you check the situation From since I was small eyes are so common That type of feeling When you need some motivation This thing could bring down the rain and the thunder You see Wendy's so capcalling. They give me powers to jam till morning. It's four o'clock in a downtown party. And I'm a-feeling to love somebody.
