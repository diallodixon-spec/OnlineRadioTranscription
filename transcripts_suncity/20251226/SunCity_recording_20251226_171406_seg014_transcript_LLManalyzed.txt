20251226 171406 Boogie on records. I did it before. Been a while, you know. So get a link, my bro. Boxing Day vibe. The weekend vibe. Sing by the quarrel stones. If you wanna run away with me, I know a galaxy and I can take you for a ride I had a premonition that we fell into a rhythm where the music don't stop for life Glitter in the sky, glitter in my eyes, shining for you
