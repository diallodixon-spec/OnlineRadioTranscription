20251222 103618 from strife. Life is to live through the best in life. You only live once, you're not live twice. Follow the road on the righteous path, still focus and can't just put you in your tatters. But when you're wicked, then corrupt your heart. Do the right thing, become the worst, yes or yes or. Take away yourself from trouble, from trouble. Because it come in a double. Take away yourself, from trouble. I say mind to sink inside. Rebuilding Jamaica. If I can help somebody as I travel alone. If I can deal somebody with the words of my song.
