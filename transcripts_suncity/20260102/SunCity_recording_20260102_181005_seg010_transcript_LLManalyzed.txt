20260102 181005 Take these beautiful things that I've got. Please stay. I want you. I need you. Oh, God. Don't take these beautiful things I've got. Oh. Please don't take I found my mind I'm feeling insane It's been a while but I'm finding my faith If everything is good and it's great Why do I sit and wait till it's gone? Oh, I'll tell you I know I've got enough I've got peace and I've got love But I'm up and I'm thinking I just might lose it all
