20251217 102421 sexual assault on the campus of your female students? Yes. How many? Over what period of time? That's Dr. Derek Deslandes, the president of the College of Agriculture Science and Education speaking with us yesterday afternoon and nationwide at five. Also in that conversation was the president of the Students Council, Cameron James, who urged the college to implement proper security measures for the students. I don't think enough is being done, because not only that there is an absence of security, but also proper lighting, from shuttle service, not being there during the night for students to travel between their campuses, you know, so there is a lot of issue. Firstly, the absence of security, that was one of the reasons that we think might have contributed to the unfortunate event.
