20251218 162617 I don't ever want to part. Cause you have shown me all the joy that love can bring. From the first hello, got it to the diamond ring. I want to wake up to you every morning. I finally found the love that wants me when I'm feeling I'm feeling cold So rare to have a heart that stays until I'm gray low The love that shouts my name from What is wrong with you? Are you cheating on me?
