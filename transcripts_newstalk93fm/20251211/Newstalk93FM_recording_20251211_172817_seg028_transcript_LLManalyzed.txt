We make a jiggle with the ting Move up your body and a swing I am the king for your world So the bubble when you bring it just mesmerizing It is tantalizing, come make me ceiling, girl Come on love me, don't gotta leave me, girl So don't flop me, left me hunting at the dirt You know I'm the man figure with it, girl Love how you whine and spin it, girl
