20251222 154738 Look what the hot body can do. Body be dancing. Snow white, so my body so fine. Drive past, but I made a inside. To want and I made a inside, makes sense, oh, makes sense. Hold my color near the seasons. Break down, sorry for my distance. Makes sense, oh, make sense. Hold my heart, I need resistance. Break plans, I live for my distance. Makes sense, oh, makes sense. Buddy, we look. Look what the whole body can do.
