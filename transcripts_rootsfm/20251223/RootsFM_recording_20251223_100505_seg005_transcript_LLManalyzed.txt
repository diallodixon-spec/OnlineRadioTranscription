20251223 100505 I and I claim the victory through humility, discipline, and perseverance. What the mind can conceive and believe it can achieve through love, wisdom, commitment, focus, action, and overstanding. I and I must achieve a spiritual renaissance, economic revitalization, and mastery over substance. The Zanli father, the earthly mother, and I are one. Health, wealth, and prosperity are I and I natural birthright. Blessed be the union that brings us abundance and opulence in all things divine. Let the words of I in my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable.
