20251230 155732 Thank you for an unforgettable night. We will see you next time. Give it up for the band. And the dancers. And of course, Sabrina. I love you, Taylor. That's our show. Thank you so much. Good night! You're listening to Sleek Radio, 93 FM. Once upon a time I wondered if I'd ever find a love like ours Searched around but never found the feeling that I needed in my heart When our eyes met, our souls connected, we knew right away
