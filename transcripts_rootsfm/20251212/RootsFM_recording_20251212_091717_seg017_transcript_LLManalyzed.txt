2025-12-12 10:51:31 Please, begging for protection from my enemies. Please, freeze them when they try to knock me down. Keep my feet firm on solid ground. Give me the strength to wiggle down. Keep praising the morning time. Sing praise in the evening time, no matter where I go, gonna let the whole world know, I'll forever sing you praises, sing praise when I'm going out, lot of mercy. Praise when I'm coming in, Lord. Your love may have found and spread it all around everywhere I go, yeah.
