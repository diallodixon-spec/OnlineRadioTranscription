Let's just keep it honest with each other I'll be happy for you when you find another We could kill it, but we still could Fool around with me like this Usually my actors turn to enemies But this is different Cause we didn't get closer now that you ain't with me All that love that we have Ain't no way we don't forget that In your family, love me like a family You know where you stand me So when they ask, tell them you're right one Sometimes, you can't say we did things right
