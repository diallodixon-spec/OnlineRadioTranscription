20251226 173113 at even money second choice in the betting is number seven at nine to two third choice is number number seven is Fernando and then we have five to one shot and then six and eight to one so after the big favorite you're gonna get a nice payout for whoever wins and i definitely almost pretty sure that that one horse will not win from the one hole it's a fairly competitive race and i definitely wouldn't go with that one who is left to load 12 is still out we're waiting for number four, that's London Spirit. We're also waiting for number nine, bigger boss. We're also waitin' for number seven, Fernando. And of course, my horse, Fidelity.
