The culvert channels water runoff from the Hope Road drain into the sea. The PPV operators told Radio Jamaica News that the hole, which first appeared in September, has created serious difficulties for JUTC bus drivers who have been forced to navigate hazardous turns instead of making their usual easy turn around. Drivers and commuters fear that if the problem is not addressed soon, the damage could worsen and eventually block the roadway. They are again calling for the NWA to act swiftly to restore the drainage system and roadway. And that's Headline News at this time. I'm Daniel Thompson. Next scheduled newscast is a major news at 12. News on Radio Jamaica. Stay in the know.
