We are from the finest, displaying ourselves like we don't care about nobody Out on the road, all by the steps, all in the bar, we are mighty trumpets Out on the road all on the steps, all by the trumpets, where we meeting up, hey Drop your location, tell me where you want me to find you, with no hesitation, I'll leave and you in, I'll find you Drop your location, show me where you want to find me, with no hesitation Make me by your step, we're ready for the road on Monday morning, the road meeting. We have a meetin' on the road on Tuesday morning, the road meetin'. I am the CEO for the road. The road meetin', the road meetin', so I call another actor.
