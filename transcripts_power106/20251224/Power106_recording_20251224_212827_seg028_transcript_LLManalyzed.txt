We have to think of them and our prayers goes up for them. And as I said, it's Christmas time again. We may not enjoy it as before, but we have life. And I must say to Jamaica again, to my sister, Eda, and Ruby, and you know, my mother passed away. And lots of our daughter there as well, big up yourself, Corona. And, you know, my sincere greetings to the whole of Hono, the whole of Jamaica. Greetings, Sister Ida again and Sister Ruby. Big up yourself.
