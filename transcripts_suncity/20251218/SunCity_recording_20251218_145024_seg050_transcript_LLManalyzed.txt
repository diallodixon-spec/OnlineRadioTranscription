20251218 145024 For my home, more than you could ever know. Make my wish come true. All I lot for Christmas There is just one thing I need And I don't care about the present Underneath the Christmas tree I don't need to hang my stockings. They look on the fireplace, and the clothes will make me happy. With a toy on Christmas day, I just want you for my own, more than anything.
