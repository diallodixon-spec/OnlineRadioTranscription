20260102 152215 So long, my friend, this adios and goodbye. Tell all me friends about you and all of me family too. Boy, look where you're going and do. Thought that I was your baby, your number one and only. You do the wrong thing to mess with TC. Just when I thought that you were the right man. To love one side, life after massive. This party's gonna be all right. All night party All night party
