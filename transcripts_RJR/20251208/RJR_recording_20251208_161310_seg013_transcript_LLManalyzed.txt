Then the enemy said shut your mouth But I praise it just the same love I feel like dying But my feelings do not detain my breath You've come through for me before And Lord, do it again, do it again here Joy is coming in the morning Peace, though the storm is raging Joy is coming in the morning Peace, though the storm is raging You turned the morning into dancing You took my burdens and you clothed me with your joy You've been so good to me And I'm gonna give you praise
