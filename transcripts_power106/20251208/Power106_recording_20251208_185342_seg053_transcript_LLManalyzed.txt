============================================================

They're a really good team and it took a buzzer beater for us on Friday night with Kofi getting the tip in at the buzzer. And I thought we played a really solid game on Monday night. We took a 20 point lead in the third quarter and they chipped back into it like any good professional type team would do. Basketball is a game of runs and you don't want to get too high when things are going your way and you don't wanna get too low when things aren't going your way. So we were able to overcome their final push and come away with two wins that I don't think a lot of people around the international basketball world expected. So that was fun. Yes, and the same for cyber we are talking about here. Nearly 200 points in both games and the Baker scored over 90.
