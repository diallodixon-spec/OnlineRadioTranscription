20251222 115139 over 150 volunteers journeyed from all across the Credit Union movement, and this could not have been possible without our donors. So in addition to the 23 Credit Unions, we had donors from World Council of Credit Unions, the Caribbean Confederation of Credit Unions at the regional body that governs Credit Unions, and we had Kuna Caribbean, who is our insurance partner, and Dade County Federal. So we, you know, it was all about cooperation among cooperatives to reach our people and that we did. Yes. So I gather there are phases to this recovery. I want to share that there's a phase two. How is that? What's the plan? All right. So we would have completed the relief phase, which, you know, many purposes did, and big up to Corporate Jamaica because we were not alone in the field. So we've completed phase one and now we're looking to move to phase two and working with partners, government agencies, as best as possible to look at the recovery process.
