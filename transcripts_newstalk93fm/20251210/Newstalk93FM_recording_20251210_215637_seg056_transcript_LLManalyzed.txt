You're listening to Sleek Radio, 93 FM. whatever kind of love like ours. Searched around but never found the feeling that I needed in my heart. When our eyes met, our souls connected, we knew right away every moment, every single road led you to me. I love you so, never gonna let you go I want the world to know, and answer to my prayers I'm loving you so now, louder than the loudest thunder
