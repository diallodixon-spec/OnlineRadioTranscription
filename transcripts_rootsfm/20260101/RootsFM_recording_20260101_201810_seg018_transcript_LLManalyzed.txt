20260101 201810 I don't know much about guns but I've been shot by you And I don't know when I'm gonna die but I hope that I'm gonna die by you I don't much about I, I know I will fight for you. Hey, just when I pull up my fist, I realize that I'm laying right next to you, baby. We ain't got nothing but love And darling you've got enough for the both of us You make love to me and my day
