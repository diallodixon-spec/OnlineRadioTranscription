**Exclusive Interview with Mrs. Faith Crooks, President of the Cayman Islands Netball Association**

In a recent interview on Power Play, a popular radio program, Mrs. Faith Crooks, the president of the Cayman Islands Netball Association, shared her insights and experiences with host Kate Williams. The conversation was both informative and inspiring, providing a unique glimpse into the world of netball and the challenges faced by the Cayman Islands team.

Mrs. Crooks, who is also an elite parent, having raised two accomplished children, Jordan and Julian, who are both Olympians, spoke about the recent tour of Jamaica, where the under-16 team competed against top-level teams. The objective of the tour was to expose the young players to a higher level of netball playing and to assess their skills in different positions.

When asked about the achievements of the tour, Mrs. Crooks stated, "The coaches were able to observe and assess all the players in their different positions... We won some of the matches, and I saw a really good display of the technical pieces that we were focusing on before going to Jamaica." She also highlighted the resilience of the players, particularly in their match against Gainstead, a strong team that won one of the competitions last year in Jamaica.

The conversation also touched on the long-term goals of the Cayman Islands Netball Association, including improving their ranking and qualifying for major events such as the Pan Am Games, the Commonwealth Games, and the CSC Games. Mrs. Crooks emphasized the need for commitment, high-performance coaching, strength and conditioning programs, and dedicated players to achieve these goals.

Regarding funding, Mrs. Crooks acknowledged the support of the Cayman Islands government, which covers the 5 to 21 age group, but noted that additional funding is required for the senior team to participate in international events. She praised the efforts of the association's treasurer, Ms. Nadia Adams-Richards, who spearheaded a successful fundraising campaign to support the senior ladies' team that competed in the ECCB tournament in Grenada.

Throughout the interview, Mrs. Crooks' passion and dedication to netball and the development of young players were evident. Her commitment to improving the sport in the Cayman Islands and her vision for the future are truly inspiring. As she stated, "I believe over the next two to three years, if we put our heads down and if we get a lot of commitment, we have high-performance coaching, strength and conditioning programs, you know, the physio piece and all the different tactical and technical pieces coming together. And with dedicated persons who will turn up for training and take it seriously, I believe we'll be able to move up within the next three years."

The interview with Mrs. Faith Crooks provides a fascinating insight into the world of netball and the challenges faced by the Cayman Islands team. Her story is a testament to the power of dedication, hard work, and passion, and serves as a inspiration to young players and aspiring athletes everywhere.
