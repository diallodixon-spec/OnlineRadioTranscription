20251219 133925 I would know after what has happened this year, we have a lot of vulnerable people. Absolutely. And what I like is you focus a lot on early childhood education, community development. Those areas are pretty close to you, building resilience. Yes, absolutely. Very important. So yes, that's how we started out. The foundation started about 2004 and really started focusing on early childhood education. OK. University and literacy and the needs have grown and so has the focus of the foundation. So now we're going into, we still hold true to early child education, but we've now added on youth development, entrepreneurship, and health and well-being. But our strong focus and emphasis is on early childhood education. All right, so tell me some of the projects that you would normally undertake or some of the ones that you're actually involved in now. Yeah, we're doing a whole heap of things because there is so much to be done, right? It's never enough, but we're trying to play our part to make a difference.
