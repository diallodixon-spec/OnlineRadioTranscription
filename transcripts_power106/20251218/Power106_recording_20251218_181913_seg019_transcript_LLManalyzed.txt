20251218 181913 to be, you know, head of delegation going to Slovenia. That was 2002. I've been to every Olympiad since. In fact, I've been to, I think, 12 straight World Cup Olympiads. During that time I've served as captain, I've served as coach. I've served as player, administrator, served as delegate. The first time I was a delegate was at the 2004 Olympiad in Calvia, Mallorca in Spain. And then in 2006 in Turin, Italy, I became a judge on the World Chess Court. It's called the Ethics Commission. I was led by an Italian judge at the time, Roberto Rivelo. And he's now a court of appeal judge, and I still serve with him on the constitutional commission of the International Church Federation. I was elected to that body in 2018. And again, then, that Congress was led by Tony Georgia, formerly a part of the Soviet Union.
