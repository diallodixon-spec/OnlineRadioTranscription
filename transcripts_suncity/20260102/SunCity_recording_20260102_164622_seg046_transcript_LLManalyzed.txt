20260102 164622 The police come to dance and I'm ready Again, you turn up the speed now Baby, make noise if you want more Don't, daddy, daddy So fall for your mama, be your mama Me no matter what, I'm the police Come to dance, don't I'm ready Ready, ready Look in on me, I know I'm not gonna diss you, baby Wind up your body, girl Wind up your body girl Here we from, we're fine, yo You alone, why not your body girl? Here before me find you, you alone with one in the house of drugs. Seen like you sound like me name Jiggy Youngs. You spin like one of Cash Money's fly stubs. You take two more, now it's trick-or-treat. Like power or shower, like the Crips and the Grunts. Me turn up the skin up, baby, make noise if you want, but don't, daddy, daddy. It's a fall for you, momma, for you, but for me, no matter what, it's time to fly.
