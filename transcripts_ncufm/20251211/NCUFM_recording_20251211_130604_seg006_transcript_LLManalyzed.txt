============================================================

Just let me breathe I have much more to give It's high time to look above If you know God, then you know love For what you sow, that you shall reap It is all stored in history's heap I can't breathe Please stop thinking for a while I can't breathe I'm a parent, someone's child I can't breathe, I just don't want to live Just let me breathe I have much more to give I know this won't last forever
