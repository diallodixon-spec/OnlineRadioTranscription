20251224 151106 So you better come through this time, please let my cry And if I ever let you down, my friend It was a misunderstanding So if I took it for granted Then I promise from today I'll go jump like I never jump Waved like I never waved Wired like I never wanted to Just to show you a summer, a summer And I'll meet you back in my life. You got people by the truck. Emotions running high. We underpin the sky. Tears running down we eye. Can't you tell that we sorry? We sorry. And we need you back in we eye I need a comeback Come on to me, come on to me Come on to me I, I need time, no place to go Come on to me
