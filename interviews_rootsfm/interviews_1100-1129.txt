Ethiopian Orthodox Church Celebrations Discussed on Roots FM Radio Program

In a recent interview on Roots FM, Katis Oyunde, a prominent member of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church, joined the host to discuss the upcoming Ethiopian Orthodox celebrations. Oyunde, a recording artist, entrepreneur, and author, shed light on the significance of Ethiopian Christmas, which is celebrated on January 7th.

According to Oyunde, the Ethiopian Orthodox Church follows an ancient calendar, which is different from the Western calendar. This calendar difference is the reason why Ethiopian Christmas is celebrated on January 7th, rather than December 25th. Oyunde explained that the Ethiopian church has never followed the Western calendar, and instead, has maintained its traditional calendar, which dates back to the time of Christ.

Oyunde also discussed the fasting and praying that takes place before the celebration of Ethiopian Christmas. She explained that the church fasts for 43 days, starting from November 25th, and breaks the fast on January 7th to welcome the birth of Christ. This tradition is rooted in the biblical story of the three wise men who searched for the star, and is a unique aspect of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church's celebrations.

The host and Oyunde also talked about the upcoming celebration at Skyline Levels in Kingston, which will take place on January 7th. The event, called Melcham Genna, will feature performances, special guests, and a donation drive. Oyunde emphasized the importance of giving and donating to those in need during the celebration.

Throughout the interview, Oyunde shared her insights and knowledge about the Ethiopian Orthodox Church and its traditions. She encouraged listeners to do their own research and learn more about the church's history and practices. The host and Oyunde also discussed the significance of the celebration and its relevance to the modern world.

The interview was marked by technical issues, with the host experiencing difficulties with Zoom and having to switch to WhatsApp to continue the conversation. Despite these challenges, the discussion remained engaging and informative, providing listeners with a deeper understanding of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church and its celebrations.

In a surprising moment, Oyunde mentioned that the Ethiopian calendar is currently in the year 2018, highlighting the significant difference between the Ethiopian and Western calendars. She also emphasized the importance of understanding and respecting the traditions and practices of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church, which is rooted in ancient Christianity.

Overall, the interview provided a unique and fascinating glimpse into the Ethiopian Orthodox Church and its celebrations. Oyunde's passion and knowledge about the subject matter made for an engaging and informative discussion, and the host's enthusiasm and curiosity added to the conversation's dynamic.
