20251219 091918 NCB to respond to this issue, but we have been unsuccessful in that regard, and so we resort to this medium. All right, thank you so much, Mikael, for calling. NCB, you're up. We are way past the break. Let's take strong, resilient and full of love. A love that moves us to give. Now at Mothers, you can pay it forward. With just $300, you can donate a meal to someone in need. Because sometimes a warm meal is more than a belly full. It's hope, comfort and a reason to smile.
