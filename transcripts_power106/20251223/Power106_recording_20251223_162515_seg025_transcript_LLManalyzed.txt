20251223 162515 You can't even night. You're tired from all the campaigning you did. Sister Althea, I just want to use this opportunity to wish Davin, Simon Crosskill and Dr. Gale and yourself and my good friend, Jessie, from my family to yours, a merry and happy Christmas. And Davin is giving you two thumbs up. He says thanks, blessings to the general election, Sister Haltia. That's not why we give you the platform.
