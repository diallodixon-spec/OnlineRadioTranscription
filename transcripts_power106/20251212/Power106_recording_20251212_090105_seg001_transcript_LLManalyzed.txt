All these things and more, darling. That's what Christmas means to me, my love. Oh, yeah. I feel like running wild. I'll drink to that little child. Reach you and meet the mistletoe. Kiss you once and then some more. And wish you a Merry Christmas, baby. Wish you a Merry Christmas. Oh, and such happiness in the coming year. Oh, baby, let's stick the hearts together. Sing sweet solon now. Fill the tree with angels.
