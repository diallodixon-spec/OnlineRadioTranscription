20251212 144842 Waking up in the morning, sit by the window pane Looking for the sun while I'm watching it rain Search through the skies to find a light ray dark clouds and low but you'll guide the way so I wait patiently for a change as I'm working and working everyday as we got to get out of the struggle someday get to get, got to get out of the struggle some day. Got to get, got to get out. Rise to the front and give thanks enough. Hey, hey, hey. Got to get got to get out, got to get down, got to struggle some day. We've got to win.
