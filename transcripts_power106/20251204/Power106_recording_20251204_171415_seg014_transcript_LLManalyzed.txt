was just about ready to head over to Jamaica and now it's all gone. Michael Bennett and other volunteers have been gathering donations to send to Jamaica after the country was devastated by Hurricane Melissa. But when they came to their storage facility to load a 20 foot truck this morning, everything was gone. Bennett says he was shown security footage captured by the company Public Storage in Mississauga. He says it shows a flat truck break through a locked gate back up to this blue trailer where the barrels and crates of goods were stored. The truck was loaded up before driving away, all around five in the morning. It doesn't matter about the stuff and all that thing. The food is more important than even some of the other stuff that's there. You know what I mean? What are they going to do with it here? Absolutely nothing, man. Absolutely nothing.
