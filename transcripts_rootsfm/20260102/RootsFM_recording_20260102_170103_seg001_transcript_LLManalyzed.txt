The event was held at St. William Grant Park, where close to 400 individuals gathered to enjoy hot meals, games, and fellowship in a safe and welcoming space. The initiative was staged in partnership with several supporting organizations, including Hummingbird Charities, and focused on reminding some of the city's most vulnerable residents that they are seen, valued, and cared for. Participants took part in board games such as Domino's and Ludi, shared meals, and spent time socializing, many expressing appreciation for the chance to relax and connect with others. Organizers say the effort was meant to go beyond food distribution, creating a moment of dignity and community for people who often face harsh and dangerous realities on the streets.
