20260102 160205 So I wake up early in the morning Give thanks to the light of God Hit my move on, add with my shoes on Today I'm gonna give my all No complaining, God is moving He controls all my life What is mine is mine. You cannot take it away. I leave the negative things behind. It's a brand new day, I'm walking in my flip-flops I've got a message for my destructors For you, I ain't got no time It's a brand-new day Hey, hey, hey, hey
