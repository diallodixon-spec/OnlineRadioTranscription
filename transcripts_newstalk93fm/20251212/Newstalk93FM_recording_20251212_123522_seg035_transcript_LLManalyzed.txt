20251212 123522 There are no hard feelings if you only want to act like babies too For a night or two And sometimes in the morning go back to being someone you never knew You never knew Baby don't you worry You ain't gonna hurt me tonight You won't be the worst thing If this is how it is, then she kissed me again And said you don't want this heart, but it's already broke Told me everything she told us just goes up in smoke Only stayed a couple nights
