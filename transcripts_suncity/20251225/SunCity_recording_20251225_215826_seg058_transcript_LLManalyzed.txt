20251225 215826 Be easy, don't make decisions when you're mad The path you chose to run alone I know you're independent, you can make it on your own Here with me, you have a home But time is of the essence, why spend it alone, huh? The nights I've waited up for you Promises you made about coming through So much time you wasted That's why you had to replace you It makes a cat nervous, the thought of settling down Especially me, I was creeping all over town Thought my tender touch could lock you down I knew I had you, as cocky as it sounds The way you used to giggle right before I put it down It's better when you angry, come here, I'll prove it now, come in. Stop playing, oh, you gave in. I gotta leave you alone. I'm good, holding down the spot, and I'm good. When you come on the block, I'm good. I like to stay alive, so without me, you'll be fine. Right? Oh, my God, I'm so lucky.
