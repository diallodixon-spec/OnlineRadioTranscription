20251212 213720 You can count my grace, I just say my lane, my lane Me no get the time for the hate and the bad energy, got my mind on my money Make you dance like broccoli, steady green like broccoli Steady on my grind, no more hear what they want Telling me you could deny my fantasy Don't want to check if my tap in the rush But see the rush, see the rush fire, well it be much Now where they make my tap, be the rush Yeah I'm going to make my top, did it rush? You can't money without. Did it rush? Did it rush? Where can it be much? Don't be hype, everybody get crushed. There's no joining with us.
