20251225 155323 So suddenly, so fast. How could it be that our sweet memories would be all, all that we have left? And now that you're gone, every day I go on. But life's just not this end. I'm so empty inside, and my tears I can't hide. But I'll try, I'll try to face the pain Though I'm missing you You know life goes on, you know what I mean? Hey, shut up, it's all the peeps right about now. I'm missing a loved one, for the Christmas.
