offerings from their surplus wealth, but she, from her poverty, has offered her whole life. The Gospel of Luke chapter 21 verse 1 to 4. The theme for today is a question. What is the difference between forgiveness and excuses? What is the difference? When somebody is forgiven, is that person also excused? Or when somebody is excused is that person also forgiven? Never in the scriptures do we refer to God as one who excuses us because of our sins. But God always forgives. Because there is a difference between excuse and forgiveness. There is a big difference. Do you remember Peter who denied Jesus three times? When Peter and the risen Lord met, what did Jesus ask Peter?
