Well, Cliff, as you know, we're just trying to represent Jamaica as best as we can. We are also buoyed by the performance of our bobsled team. We are also at S Hotels, a sponsor there, and we're really thrilled that they've been doing so well, and we're looking forward to them putting a good showing in the Olympics. And at this time when so many of our other fellow Jamaicans have had it so hard, we're just hoping, as we said, race to recovery, that we can literally treat this as a race and get everybody involved and make everything as literally as in the racing world. We talk about pit stop, pit stop action, get things back up and running in those areas that have been affected in our country.
