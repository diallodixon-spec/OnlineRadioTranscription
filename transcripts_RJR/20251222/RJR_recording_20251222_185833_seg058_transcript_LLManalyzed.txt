Renarda Brown with that report. Meanwhile, President of the Jamaica Basketball Association, Jabba Paulton-Gordon, is adamant the next round of FIBA America's World Cup qualifiers will be played on the island. The national team was forced to play Puerto Rico away in their opening game last month, as aspects of the National Indoor Sports Centre were not up to FIBA requirements. Jamaica have two more qualifying games set for the National Indoor sports centre next year, where they are slated to meet the Bahamas on February 26 in Canada on March 1. Gordon says the association is in need of close to $50 million to host the games. We need about $280,000 U.S. dollars.
