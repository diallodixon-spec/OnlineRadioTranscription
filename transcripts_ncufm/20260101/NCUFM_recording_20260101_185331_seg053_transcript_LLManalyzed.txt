20260101 185331 Today we want to sing a chorus And it's a chorus of surrender to the Lord We want to say yes to Jesus We want to give our all to him We want to say yes to Jesus. We want to give our all to him. We want to totally surrender to him so that he can take control of our lives and so that his will can be done in our lives. That's his will for each and every one of us. So we want to sing that song to him today and we want you to lift your hands as we worship the Lord with this song and we're gonna sing yes to our God
