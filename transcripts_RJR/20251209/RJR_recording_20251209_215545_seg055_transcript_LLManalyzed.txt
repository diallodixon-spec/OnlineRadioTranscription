I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Yes. Yeah, man. Go ahead, Gail. Right. I'm sorry, my mic was muted. So no, I'm just going to repeat. The personal chattels are those things that are personal, our personal nature that belong to the deceased. Like we mentioned, furniture, paintings, expensive paintings, those are chattels too. Jewelry, equipment that is not used primarily for a business, motor vehicles that are not used for a business, more for private use, and it excludes any land. So an apartment would fall into real estate. So that is not considered a personal chattel at all. Okay, if somebody owns an apartment and dies and say all her personal effects go to X, Y and Z, the apartment is not included.
