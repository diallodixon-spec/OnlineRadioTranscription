Walk to the car and then you are Can't explain the rush that I feel Open up the door, you pull me closer Then you put your lips on me I really, really like When I put it all together for you I'm gonna take my time My nails had new perfume Hated when you had to leave, but I don't say a thing Cause I will absolutely get the ring No worries, no worries Oh baby baby baby baby I'm gonna use my expertise Imma keep it nice, imma keep it neat Imma keep it sugar'ma keep it nice I'ma keep me I'ma keep the sugar I'ma keep this sweet
