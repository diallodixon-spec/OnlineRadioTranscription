A night for romance, a night you won't forget So come jump on, this ain't no time to be staying home Ooh, there's too much going on Tonight is gone, I'll see you night like it never lost We're gonna have a good time the whole night long To the beat of the rhythm of the night Dance until the morning light Forget about the words on your mind You can leave them all behind Oh, the rhythm of the night
