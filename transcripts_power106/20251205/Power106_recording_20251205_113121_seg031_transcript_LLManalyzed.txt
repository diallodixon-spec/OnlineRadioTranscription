Netflix, I think the quality of movie making has gone down. Not necessarily television series, but movies in general have gone down. But $83 billion. I wonder what the regulators are saying. Well, you see, that's it. And remember, the regulators, like everything else in America, respond to what Trump wants. If Trump don't like this deal, the FAA will intervene. And that's a possibility. Because he put a finger in everything. We do know that Paramount was also interested in the same deal. And Beck said he never get it. I'm not sure what relationship Trump has with Paramountount because it could be positive, it could be negative. Depends on who Paramount owns. If they own ABC and what not. Fake news, fake news.
