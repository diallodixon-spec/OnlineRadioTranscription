20251229 203716 Passes it to Scorch in Saturday, oh my word! What a goal! What a goal, it your wrist. Check the time in I figure I'll come for you. I'm telling you, I'm begging you to dance. I'm tellin' you, I'm beggin' you to dance. Can't wind up your body, can't wind to the top. Turn around, turn around, I'm a snapchat. Who was panicked by a car that dropped off? Maybe it was me, Black Mary, take a snapchat, man. I don't care if I'm black, maybe I'm a stash. Smooth as smooth as rap.
