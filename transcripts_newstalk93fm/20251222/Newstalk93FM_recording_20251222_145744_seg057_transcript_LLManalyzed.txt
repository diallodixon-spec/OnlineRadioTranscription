But if they can't call and they can't send a text, then we have numbers that they can send text to. And those numbers, once they text us, we can respond if they can't talk. And we have to call, we would call back. There is a new line that is also there for mental health. If a person wants to speak with somebody because they have a mental health issue and they want somebody to talk to, they can call that number and get help in order to have somebody just talk to them and walk them through it. It's 888-NEWLIFE 888-639-5433. Gender-based support? Check. Mental health support? Check. There's more. You can contact the Domestic Violence Intervention Centers of the JCF and they have them in different parachutes. You go through this line and they will link you based on your location. It is 876-224-4274.
