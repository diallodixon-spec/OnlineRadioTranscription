I mean, it's cold sometimes, of course, especially. Well, today is a very good day. We have 46 degrees today. That's good. Very good day. Yes. Yeah. Ah. So talk to me, Rupert. Yeah? How is the Christmas? Who do you want to big up for Christmas? Well, I have a lot, but to make it short, I just want to big up my children in St. Thomas, Odin, a firefighter, and his wife, and Shibna Ryan, Oshin, and Shannon, and their extended family, of course. I want to bring out my mother, Yvonne Stephen, in Moray Bay.
