20251226 191106 You don't have to return about it cause it's crystal clear now, now Guess it's bye to the good times I'll be gone by the sunrise I'll be better on my own I'll better be on my own, now, now Nobody should call my phone Nobody should call me phone, now, now This is my last hard break song This is my last heartbreak song, break song. I'll be good on my own. Why are you so quick to leave? When we both can make it worse. When I'm gone, I'll make you nervous. If you hurt me, I deserve it. I've been acting foolishly, forgetting what you are. You start loving me, I deserve it I've been acting foolishly Forgetting what you are You start loving me, I know this But even chaos serves a purpose It feels good to love somebody And somebody loves you back So don't give in to your dreams
