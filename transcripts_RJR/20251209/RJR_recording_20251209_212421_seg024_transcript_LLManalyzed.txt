when there is no will, but what are some of the other situations? Because we do know that there are times when people die leaving a will, yet there is still a grant of administration that is applied for. Why is that? When would that become necessary, Ingrid? Indeed, because what would have happened is that there may be assets that would have been not included in the will. And there was perhaps no residual clause that would take care of those other assets. And therefore, they would perhaps would have had to do letters of administration in that regard. Also, if it is that the executors refuse to act when there's a will, then they could always ask the administrator general to step in.
