20260102 214939 I wanna hit that high, yeah, yeah When the gray skies out of my way You make the sunshine brighter than the dollar state Turn the bright spark into a flame My beats permanent have never been the same Cause you're my lady on like a yo-yo Wake me up before you go go I don't wanna miss when you hit that high Wake me up Before you go-go Cause I'm not planning on going solo Wake me up Before You Go-Go Take me dancing tonight
