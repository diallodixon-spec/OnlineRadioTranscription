20251215 204837 Oh! And even though the waves are rough, this love is tough. Just love me. Deep as the blue sea, deep as the blue sea. Love me really and truly. And even though the storms will come, no, we won't run. Just love me, deep as blue sea. Nice and easy, so deeply we submerge under this emotion. Like an anchor, you keep me safe.'m not afraid of the ocean I keep you warm and cosy You'll be coming on me arms When the storms approaching So why panic When all of us think like the titanic The lighthouse, we are where I fall in Look as the blue sea Your love's flowing into me
