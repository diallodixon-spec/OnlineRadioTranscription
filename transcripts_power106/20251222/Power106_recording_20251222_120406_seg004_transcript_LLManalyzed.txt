20251222 120406 The country has recorded 366 road fatalities, surpassing the total number of recorded deaths for all of 2024. There were 365 deaths from 315 collisions last year. The Ireland Traffic Authority says the 366 deaths as at December 22 represent a 3% increase over the same period year, when 356 fatalities were recorded. Two single-vehicle crashes in Manchester yesterday, where a private motor car passenger and a motorcycle driver died, have contributed to the upward movement in the year-to-date figures for 2025. Vice Chairman of the National Road Safety Council, Dr. Lucian Jones, says the most at-risk group is motorcyclists, 111 of whom have died this year. He has called for the resumption of a motorcyclist training program which was discontinued as a means of reducing fatalities.
