20251219 093628 I started touching the night, but since Sunday into to date. I've got no worse We have one side of the house with 144 to 149 weight and the other side down to a low of 74 volts We have telephone more than burning up. We have wireless phone running up. We have Wi-Fi. Where is that? This is in Stonehill, Kingwood, and it is not just in my area ofview Drive where I live. Everybody in the area is complaining and we have been calling JPS from me, from 500 and more. Diamond Road, side of Stonehill. Right now, every light in the house is blinking like Pinoy. And I realized that was some more in the day. When it gets down into the night, it will flicker. But when I put the meter on it, it will go down to 97 volts. So obviously you are an electrician? Yes, I am an electrician. And you know, electrician work started.
