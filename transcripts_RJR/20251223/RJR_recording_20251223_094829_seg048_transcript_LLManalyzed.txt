20251223 094829 Somewhat as you are in this season, but we are soldering on because we want to hear your views as well So let's try the phone lines Good morning. Welcome to hotline. This is Clive Mullins. Good morning, Mr Mullins. How are you? I'm good. Thanks. Welcome. What's happening? All right, Mr Mullins What I called you for this morning is something that I spoke to you about already, and I spoke to Dr. T. But this time around, I want you to go to the leader of the opposition. That will be his new year resolution. I want him to get the commission of police at his office or his Mr. Opposition Leader office. find out from him that you hear about a murder which took place so long. Why is it not solved? I'm referring to the murder that was committed in a prominent attorney bedroom. I'm not using the word house.
