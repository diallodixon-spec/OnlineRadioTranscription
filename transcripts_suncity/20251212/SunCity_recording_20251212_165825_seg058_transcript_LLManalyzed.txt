20251212 165825 I don't even want to do this anymore Cause you already know what you mean to me And others say all you want We're fighting alone Wherever you go, that's where I'll follow Nobody's promised tomorrow So I'ma love you every night like it's the last night. Like is the last night. If the world was ending, I'd want to be next to you. If the party was over.
