20260101 170102 I know you've done a lot wrong But I'm willing to forgive No one has the right to decide How the other man should live Sometimes we should stop and count to ten Before we make each other hurt Cause later on you realize You really had no worth I see love from a distance Coming but slowly I know it's gonna last forever I feel us getting closer closer and closer it's the time we get it together if i follow my heart
