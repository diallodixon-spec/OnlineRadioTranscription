20260101 134628 So, Paul's typical greeting in his epistles calls Christians in those places saints. That is, through baptism, they have been set apart as God's special people, just as the people of Israel, through the practice of circumcision, had been set apart as a holy nation. Now, this has utterly nothing to do with the Roman Church's practice of canonizing people as saints, okay? The beatification of, you know, dead popes or members who did outstanding work for the Church are later on, you know, beatified as saints. This has nothing to do with that. Once you accept Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savior, you have become a saint. It means sanctified. You are forgiven, you are justified, you are set aside for God's holy use, you are saint. It doesn't mean you're perfect.
