in prosecuting and, you know, implementing fines. Of course, part of the problem is that we have to catch the perpetrators first. I was going to ask, because we can have all the law in the world and the stiffest penalties in the world if we're not catching nobody. That's correct, but we want to make sure that we have everything in place so that when one or two are caught, then we make an example of them. And of course, we've caught in the past, but the fines and the penalties were so marginal that people had no effect. We made improvements. But there's another concept that I would love to share as well that will take some discussion. But I think there's an argument that can be made that attack on the infrastructure perhaps can be prosecuted under Section 32C of the Terrorism Prevention Act of 2005.
