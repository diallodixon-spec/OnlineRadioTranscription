All right, we're back with you as we live in the positive. important man I wonder if Brentford can beat Arsenal today so I hope we can beat Leeds yeah man so I need Brentford to beat Arsenal I need maybe Brighton and A Villa to draw. I would love Burnley to beat Crystal Palace to keep them at bay. Likewise Wolves, nothing on Forest. So Leeds, Burnley, Wolves in the bottom three. And we have Leeds and then Liverpool face Sunderland.
