is really and truly the fact. What is happening now, Shelly, is that these cars are more dependent now on the turbo to do the work and not really the engine, even though both of them are working in conjunction to get you the horsepower. Why I say this, Shelly, if your turbo goes bad, that little engine inside there can barely move that car. So if you don't have the turbo on it, you will barely barely crawl and I had a customer brought a Honda Accord to me where the turbo went bad but there was no turbo on the car and the engine did not have enough power to even come out of my property so that is how dependent on the turbocharger these new cars are going to be because of how small engine is and and so on so you have to have the turbocharged working what I want to say to the listener Shelley if you were driving a car that did not have a turbocharger you cannot maintain it and service that turbocharged car as you did
