He used to dig a massive hole on the ground and pack it for days. Pack the wood and then light it down there and cover it back up. And it burns for weeks. Make a big mound. Down the ground, you know? Yeah. There's nothing on the top really. But they would use the same dirt that they get out of the hole to come back down there and build a mound. I don't know, I don't remember how tall the mound was. I don't remember any raised area above ground. All I know is it took weeks for that thing to burn and then weeks to cool. And then when you go down there, voila, coal on top of coal, on top of coal. I think it's the same way they used to burn it in my area. There wasn't a lot of persons there burning coal though, but it's a similar thing. You'd see this mound.
