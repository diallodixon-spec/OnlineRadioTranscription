They sent back some more papers again to be signed, and I did all what they do. And I called, and I heard that it's at the stamp office. First, they will probe it, probe out. What do they do? Probe it. Probe it, right. And it was at the stamp office for a couple years. And it go on and go on for years, till out of the blue, one of the whenever I see the executor. And he told me that they're trying to call me and I can't get me. But then get him and tell him that my parents title, registered title, is false. It's not good. And I am coming with some money to get my parents original title good. To get the bad title regularized. Right. So anyhow I call them.
