20251229 140101 This sweating spirit havin' me feelin' good. I have a linin' spirit. Early in the mornin' I had it. Me cooler ready. Me high stand ready. Me punchin' that's automatic. I have linin' jumbie. A kind of energy inside me. And it ready for the rum, ready, ready for the rum Ready, ready, for the rum Ready for the action, a spiritual encounter In me soul faking over Telling me to start up the drinking And do away with good behaviour So let we go, let we go down the road Let we go, it's action time, let we go It's's back on our time, here we come. Hands up. This sweating spirit of me feeling good.
