20260102 135743 has failed Jamaica. We know that, we know that. But we have failed to hold them accountable as a people. We have allowed them to get away with, I think for the most part, incompetence. Never mind the corruption side of it, but I think the larger issue is that they have not fulfilled the agreement they made with the people. I've seen many dons taken out, they spawn resurface shortly after. It is foolish people who think you can kill your way out of violence. That is true, that is true. Simon, does Jamaica Critic raise your blood pressure when he calls? Not at all, nobody does.
