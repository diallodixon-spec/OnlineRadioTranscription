You're not damn You blow baby you cocked in Passenger princess I've been Girl you knowin' what time it is Girl I'ma lock it in Beat that **** out the box again Tryna see where your conscience is Can we keep this anonymous? Or you want me monogamous? Or why? May take the world around You make it easy for me to believe in you love it You better believe it cause maybe I'm living with something Better than the d*** you had before Smiling cause you know I know you know I You better sell, I treat you well, I will It's good I can tell, come give me hell, come here Give me your baby's hell under your spell, I am She gets your nails, I'm the only one who can You scream and yell, can't come for help, I'm here You leave in webs, I feel your nails, hurray
