I am the Facility Manager Administrator for Mustard Seed Community's Gift of Hope in Spurtree, Manchester. We currently have 25 residents in our care who are physically and mentally challenged. We have a staff complement of 31. And all these staff members are here of the residents. All our residents have disabilities. Some of the disabilities include cerebral palsy, seizure disorder, hydrocephalus, microcephaly, blindness, visual impairing and autism. Well, our preparation actually started for the hurricane. We started our preparation in May of this year.
