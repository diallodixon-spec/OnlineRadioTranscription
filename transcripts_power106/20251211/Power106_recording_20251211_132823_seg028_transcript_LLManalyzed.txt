Give me something. Alright, let me ask you this. Let me see if you can be honest. When KFC gave away the two-for-one meals, whenever it was, and everybody line up and, were you one of those who was cursing for say, look how Jamaica people are lining up? I feel, I feel, yeah. Oh yeah. So you could see where it looked bad in relation there so. But when the Prime Minister come out and say, why I really like to see people bungle up, bungle up and fight for food, it not look good on the country, this would be a better solution. But Simon, to counter your argument, that was in normal time you know. It if you don't understand what the Prime Minister is saying.
