So I was duly informed in that chat, and I asked a couple of questions, that they're selling these cards, and people are going around saying, you know, it's for tax exemption, and people are saying that they've taken it to the United States in order to open bank account.

They have, when they go to any places, they have a card and they're tax-exempt.
