Are your words and your actions building others up or are they quietly tearing them down? And what are some ways that you think you can reflect Christ's love more intentionally today? You see, when love becomes our language, the church will become more than a gathering. When love is our language, a church moved from just a social gathering, it becomes a true family. A lot of family, that kind of family feel is absent from a lot of churches because we aren't loving each other the way how Christ has commanded. Are you ready to make that change? Are you ready to be vulnerable before the Lord and ask him to teach you how to love? I told you in principle, you will agree.
