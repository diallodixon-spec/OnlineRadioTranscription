United United I'm tired of running around Me and my baby's gonna settle down I'm gonna make her my June bride We're gonna walk down the aisle side by side Cause I love her, she loves me That's the way it's gonna be And baby you just wait and see me We're gonna be united United We've come to the end, we're gonna be United
