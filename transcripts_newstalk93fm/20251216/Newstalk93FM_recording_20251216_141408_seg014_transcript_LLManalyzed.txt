20251216 141408 I feel your frequency from miles away You come alive with one wine, baby With you I want to dance the night away One jump turn a lifetime, baby So don't feel behind the truck and we rev it up Whole day, keep throwing it back, I know why you stop Baby no way, we could post up all the pictures you want, when you're ready. I go over here, darling. You go over there. But we could meet in the middle and start a bacchanal. Play in the middle, hey. What we gonna do now? Jam to a rhythm in the heat. I can't eval, but in the heat, hey.
