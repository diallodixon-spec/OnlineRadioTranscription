20251219 173522 One of the things the Court of Appeals said, well, how would the media houses do that? They had been arrested by police. They had been taken into custody. How would we even get those comments? And that, in addition, this was an urgent matter. It was already in the public domain, and the media houses did not report in a sensational way, nor did they adopt the statements. In other words, the media houses weren't saying, yaman demaskyama, demaskyama. They were reporting what the police said and the media houses had said, hold on, this is a police talking, this is the police commissioner talking. We're the Muskegon report, what would them say? How can we not do that? Court of Appeal agreed with those submissions. Joining us now for comment, we have Nigel Jones, who represented CVM in this matter, led the CVM team, and Gary Allen, RGR Greener Communications Group Senior Executive, who supports the legal department on defamation issues. We thank you both so much. We appreciate it.
