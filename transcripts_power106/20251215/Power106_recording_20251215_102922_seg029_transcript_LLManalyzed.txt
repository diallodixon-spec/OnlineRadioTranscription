20251215 102922 I was asked me some questions and I said, you know, think of it like this. We all know in criminal law, you have this thing called innocent until proven guilty. And that goes for everyone. I mean, even the guy who shot the senator, we see the tape, we see the man pull the gun and shoot it. But it's still a process. And there's a reason why you have that process, because not everybody is guilty, and not everything you see on tape is as it seems. There are many situations that require you to go beyond just the tape, beyond just the situation that's in your face, and to ventilate it. And employers have the handle, you know? The government has the handle. So it's really a process that acknowledges that and provides for a more equitable ground for issues to be properly explored.
