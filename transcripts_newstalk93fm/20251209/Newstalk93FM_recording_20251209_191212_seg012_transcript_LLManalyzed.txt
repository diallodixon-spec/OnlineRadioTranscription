Back when it didn't have to end We can start again There's nothing left to say Don't waste another day Just you and me tonight Everything will be okay If it's alright with you Then it's alright with me Baby, let's take this time And let's make you memories Do you remember? Do you remember? All of the times we had Let's bring it back, let's bring it back So long since you've been missing. It's good to see you again. How are you? How you doing? And how are you?
