20251218 133729 So now it's time to lose it Step aside now, let me show you how to treat a woman She needs a tender touch, she needs loving home so much Now tell me, are you crazy? Leaving her so long, oh so lonely Now she's a a winner So you better protect her Always when you're feeling blue Don't know what to do She will comfort you She's a dream come true She will be your friend When you think that it's the end She's always around She's always around Hey, hey, come on, step aside now Another love comes to me nowhere Cause you don't know my name
