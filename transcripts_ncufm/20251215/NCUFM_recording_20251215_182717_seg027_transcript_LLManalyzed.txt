20251215 182717 630 station for motion Monday today but before I go I have a quote for you and the Bible verse starting with the scripture first it's Proverbs 13 11 Wealth gotten by vanity shall be diminished but he that gathereth by labor shall increase and what does this mean? Wise management of resources and honest work leads to growth and prosperity. We live in a time where everyone wants the easy way out. Everybody wants to make it quickly but not put in the work to get there. God loves an honest man and woman. Once you put him first in anything that you do and work hard God will create the opportunities for you to succeed because the Bible says that he knows the plans that he has for us and there are plans for us to prosper and do well not for us to suffer
