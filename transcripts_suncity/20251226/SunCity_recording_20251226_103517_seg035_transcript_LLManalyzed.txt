20251226 103517 I will greet this day with love in my heart. For this is the greatest secret of success in our ventures. Sun start. 453 a.m. on weekdays, 6 a.m., on weekends with Kevin Wallen. Mothers, you are your son's first teachers. You shape their values, their attitudes, and their understanding of right and wrong. I urge you, talk to your sons. Talk to them. Son, be careful. Don't make me cry. I don't want to hold my baby or wipe the tears from my eyes.
