20251223 123931 I'm trying to do things on my own. My life is yours, it is not my own. So humbly about, Lord, before Your throne comes. I really want to make it up, to experience the pleasures that Your Word has shown. As Your sheep, let me hear Your voice, pleasing You daily as I lift my life, Lord. Let me see what You want me to, Lord. Let Me hear what You want Me to. Let me hear what you want. Let me kingdom come, let your kingdom come on earth now.
