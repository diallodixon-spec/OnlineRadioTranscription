20251222 164932 My music and my muse Everything my baby My rhythm and blues So many things you didn't do nobody No big carry you play happy to lose Carry my love put it all on you And I get the money, money for two Put over my retina when you come through Now you be my person, a person Forget each other I need blessing Other guys they don't teach me lesson It's not only you in the distress My baby. So many things they do, nobody do me like you do.
