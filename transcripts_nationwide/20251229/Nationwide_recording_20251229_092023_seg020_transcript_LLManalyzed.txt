20251229 092023 So if you have any immigration related matters, you can give us a call or we are live on YouTube. You can also leave your questions in the YouTube chat and we will try our best to get to all those questions. This is the final Immigration Mondays for 2025. So if you have any pressing questions that you need answered before the new year, now is the time because we won't be back until next year. I think the first show will be on January 5. All right, so now is the time to ask those questions. We have a caller on the line. Paul, good morning.
