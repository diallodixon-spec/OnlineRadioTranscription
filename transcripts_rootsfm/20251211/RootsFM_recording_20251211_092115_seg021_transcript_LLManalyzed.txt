If you try to stop me from doing what I want Me and you, the day my love, you can't give me no stop I just be myself and I play my part If you fall in too serious Me a little b**** driving through Kingston Who do you listen to? Roots of her mind to see 21 Give me space, give me room, give me a little breeze now Jesus, how I make you feel, sir? Through me keep it tight and me ever drink, sir Want me, did want ya, me never need ya This enough for people know, keep it pan a deal, oh Me too young, feel like done with nobody I pray one day somebody keep her company And a girl like me just for me
