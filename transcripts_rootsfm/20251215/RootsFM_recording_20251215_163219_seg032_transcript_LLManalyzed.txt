20251215 163219 I'm pleased to be killing in the West Indies I got the sunshine, rivers and trees When the rain pits up on the roof Herb just a steamed pepper pot on the stew Like it's a dream if you've got gratitude So go tell the regime they can't stop what we do now. Information you think on your own, or every day, so be careful of things where you say. Who knows? Who knows, who knows, who knows? I just go with the trade windows, sending love to my friends and foes. And I suppose I'm pleased to be chilling in the West Indies. The provider of wants and needs. I got the sunshine, rivers and trees. Green leaves.
