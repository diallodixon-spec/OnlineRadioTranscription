20260101 141515 Did I try? What with the people don't ask me why But me happy tell the truth and me can't tell no lie Never been in love with a man I gave you all the love I got I gave you more than I could give Gave you love I gave you all that I have inside and you took my love, you took my love Didn't I tell you what I believe? Did somebody say that?
