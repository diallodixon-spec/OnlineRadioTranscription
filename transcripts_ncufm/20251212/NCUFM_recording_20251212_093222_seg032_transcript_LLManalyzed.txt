2025-12-12 15:23:30 He comforts me when I'm going through the storm. I'm protected in His arms. Oh, my Father loved me. That's why I say the Lord is my life and my salvation salvation Who shall I fear? He's the strength of my life Day and night No need to be afraid When evil tries to destroy me Try to make me fall He puts me on a rock Out of the reach of the mind
