20251222 142115 Good afternoon, Chauffeur Arthur J. Wright. Good afternoon to the Drive Time family also. I want to wish my friend and sister Rochelle Graham a belated happy birthday. She celebrated her birthday yesterday. I'm wishing that God continues to bless her and strengthen her and grant her the desire of her heart, which I'm sure is to be saved in his kingdom. I want to wish her God continuous blessings as she celebrates another milestone in her life. I hope she did have a great celebration and is still celebrating. Greetings is coming from elder foresight.
