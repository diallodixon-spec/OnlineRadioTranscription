20251229 165335 Thank you so much to my family. Grace in Cumberland always locked in with us. What an amazing day today. Real inspirational. Some great guests. I really felt filled today. You know what I mean? Absolutely. Jamaica has some great people. And it's even better when those great people extend their experiences into helping and molding others. So it was good. It was such an honor to meet Sanjay Stevenson today. What a young man. I'm really, I told you, I felt impressed because he was his male and he did home economics and so much more.
