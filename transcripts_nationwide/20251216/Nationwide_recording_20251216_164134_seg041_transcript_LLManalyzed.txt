I'm doing good, how are you? We're well, we're well. Are you feeling lighter since you got a chance to really just tell your side of the story? I mean, I wasn't feeling heavy at all to be honest, but I am. All right. Why did you think Grizelle it was important for you to comment at all? To comment? Yeah. I mean, for the one, for this one time, I think it was actually important. So, you know, like people know that not everything that they see on the internet is true.
