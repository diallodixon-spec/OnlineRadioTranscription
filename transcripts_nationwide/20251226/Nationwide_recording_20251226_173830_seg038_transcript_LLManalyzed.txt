20251226 173830 Another moonlit night It's the air stick that almost stops your heart You try to scream But dare I take the sun before you make it You start to freeze And so it loops you right between my eyes You're paralyzed Cause this is killer, killer night And no one's gonna say goodbye, but this is the first strike You know it's killer, killer night You're fighting for your life inside a killer, dreadless divine You hear the door slam, I realize there's nowhere left to run You hear the cold alarm, I wonder if you ever see the sun
