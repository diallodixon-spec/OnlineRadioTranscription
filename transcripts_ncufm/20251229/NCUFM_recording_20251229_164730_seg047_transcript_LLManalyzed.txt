20251229 164730 and when at last my travel days are done in the land somewhere beyond the sun in the arms of sweet deliverance in the arms of Sweet Deliverance I will rest by and by one of these days when life is over sorrow will disappear I'm gonna and tell the glad story. Walkin' all around, all around the streets of gold. One of these days when life is full, sorrow will disappear. All around the street of gold.
