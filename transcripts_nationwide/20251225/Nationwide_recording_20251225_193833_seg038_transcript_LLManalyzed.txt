20251225 193833 I'm the man, I'm the man I'm the man Yes I am, yes I am Yes I am I believe every lie that I ever told Paid for every heart that I ever stole Paid my card and I didn't fold But it ain't that hard when you got sold This is my corner Somewhere I heard that Life is a test I can't do the words but I still get my bed God made my mold different from the rest It broke then more so I know I'm blessed Stand up now and face the sun Hot my tail or turn and run It's time to do what must be done
