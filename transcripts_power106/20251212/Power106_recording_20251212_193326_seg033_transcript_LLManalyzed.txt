20251212 193326 number seven, Neville Vanessa, will be the winner here. Five length second to four manatee on the 15th of November last week he came back, corner quarter length second to good conscience. Two very good runs indeed after being away from June. So he reported 15 at the end of the day in his back, and that I think should be good enough to get this job done. There is a horse here called feeling free horse number nine from the camp of Peter John Passad, top five trainer as I told you earlier. Gerald Stewart is the rider. Stewart of course has been just one winner in his short career and feeling free 11th, third to formalist. Little better run though when he finished just about four and a half minutes behind the useful looking ascend out of the straight course on the 29th of November. So we're looking for improvement over that as well. Is there a third threat here? Let's see, secret sensation, disappointing, no doubt about it.
