Families prepare it with different spices like ginger, cinnamon, pimento. Ooh, I've never heard of that one before. Pimento, that's most nice. And even cloves. And even something unique that I had last Sabbath. With lemonade. You can find it at different gatherings and celebrations during the festive season. Representing warmth, togetherness and the joy of December. Wanna take a pause here? I'm gonna say happy 96th birthday to Mrs Yuda Rowe of the Southfield SDA church.
