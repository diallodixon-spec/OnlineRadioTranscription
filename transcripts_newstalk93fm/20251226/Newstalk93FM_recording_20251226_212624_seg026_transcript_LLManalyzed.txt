20251226 212624 I'm not coming home tonight I'm drunk in the, so I don't think no such party can find me. I was in love by the melodies, now the liquor take all of me. And the bass knock my soul out and make sure Soka won't let me leave. I don't know if I'll survive, song after song, wine after wine. I go say shung a pitiful life. Weak like the masses, kryptonite. You can't find me, we're bound for shaking. Higher beating, to walk. Chest up, walk. Time to free up. Gonna bow, let me go. Go send a surprise.
