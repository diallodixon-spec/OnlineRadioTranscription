Oh, yeah. Lord, me candy ball friend. Friend, friend, friend, yeah. Lord me candy ball friend, until we meet up again. Ah! Mm, everything gone sat, you know. Mm, the bag gone packed, you know. Mmm, she dreaming to take a ride on me, cause she coming down to please. When she ram a chair, she push it back all the bambam rollin' And she savin' some for me I tellin' you I love whenever you bring a vibe With your hands them up in the sky Watch me drunk and havin' a time, carnival time
