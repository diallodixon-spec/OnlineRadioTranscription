Andres Cope, who is the manager and brand ambassador at S Hotel in Montego Bay. What a fantastic effort on behalf of them. And listen, some Jamaicans just aren't grateful. These are not luxury homes. These are temporary solutions that are built to take people who are out in the exposed environment and putting people in a safe environment until a more permanent solution is forthcoming officially. But brilliant. And I love the fact that it's an S hotel that is owned by Jamaicans. Fantastic.
