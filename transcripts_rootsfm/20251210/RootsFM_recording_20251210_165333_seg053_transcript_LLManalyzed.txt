Oh Tonight the music seems so loud I wish that we could lose this crown Maybe it's better this way We'd hurt each other with the things we want to say We could have been so good together. We could have lived this dance forever. The crowd is gonna dance with me. Please dance. Can I ever go to dance again? Guilty feet have got no rhythm. Oh, it's easy.
