20251229 113720 Okay, I no longer see 135 come up on my TV At all. All right. I think it skips from 102 to 132 to 137 So all the channels are blank the number doesn't even come up. Oh, I see. All right. Well, you have to say something about this, you know, because some of the customers are reacting to this. And if you're paying for your payable or seeing the channel, you want to know what is happening. It can't mean that you don't know. You may get the information that you don't agree with, that's one thing, but they need to know exactly what is taking place. Yes, because if I choose to shift from TVJ, might as well I turn off the channel because there's nothing there. All right.
