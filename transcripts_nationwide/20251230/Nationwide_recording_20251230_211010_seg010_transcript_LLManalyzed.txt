20251230 211010 Gotta take the poll. And this week we asked, can being in a relationship solely for benefits ruin the love that exists? Well, on Instagram, 83, no, 82% said yes. On X, 80% said yes. That's not necessarily surprising though, is it? So, being in a relationship for love or benefits, is there such a thing as being in a relationship for benefits and then claim that you're in love? I don't quite see it. Can the latter affect the former? So, let's throw it out there. What's the key differences between relationship based on love and a relationship based on, or better so, what's the key difference between a relationship based on love with benefits and based on benefits with love? All I want to look for in a lady. That means the more you start, because that's really what it's supposed to go. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Or you want me to walk it by you. Walk it by me. Okay. That joke.
