Me carry me. But let me tell you about, latest. Every day, me just up on the latest. Don't work on the wrong way. I know some of the things get midgy. One phone call, it takes to make some way. Wipe up the earth and drop down flat. I know, stop my food. The sun's heating right now. The sun's heating! Let me tell y'all, streets anywhere we go, y'all can see us, y'all dem not nervous, let me tell you, we go like a eskimo.
