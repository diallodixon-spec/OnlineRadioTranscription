20251226 160810 Just when you are leaving Seems I don't care anymore Just to feel you You're still believing I don't give a damn Yes, I've made my mistakes No one took to hurt you I tried so hard Just to make you understand What more can I say? What more can I do? Seems like I'm wasting my time Trying to show you You get the best of me For what I've done more than I need In every part of me Just leave, I live You get the best of me For once you're more than I need In every part of you Just for you I leave You, you, you, you
