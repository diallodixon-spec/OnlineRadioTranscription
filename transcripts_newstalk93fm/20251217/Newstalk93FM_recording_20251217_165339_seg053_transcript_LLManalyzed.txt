20251217 165339 I've been contemplating What all of this means It's not that I'm complaining But circumstances be real And I know you see these changes Yeah, around and around we go Doesn't it just feel amazing When I got you up in my zone You're like my favorite painting One I would never sell Just have you up in my room and keep you all to myself Am I supposed to feel when you're there closer Am I just can't reveal feel me emotions Am I just want to see you same girl. I want you feel the same. I want you feeling the same
