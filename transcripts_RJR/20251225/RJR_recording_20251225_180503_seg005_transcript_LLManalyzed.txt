20251225 180503 reported that about 2.30, a team of police on patrol was alerted by a shopper to a 100-foot shuttle motor car that was parked in front of the Hilo supermarket with two small children inside. The car was securely locked and all windows warmed up. The officers reportedly heard a child crying and contacted the fire brigade for assistance. A member of the public sprung into action and used the device to pry open the driver's door. The police say the children were unresponsive and their clothes were excessively hot and wet. They were rushed to the nearby Apex Medical Center for assessment where a doctor determined that they were dehydrated. The children were subsequently transported to the Spanish Town Hospital. The police say the children's mother was contacted and she reportedly admitted to leaving the children in the car to do shopping. The St. Catherine South CIB is investigating the incident.
