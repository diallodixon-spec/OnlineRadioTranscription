20251230 172616 Walked in, no weapon, made a killing Tongue kissing pretty women New iPhone cause I'm done with all the... Trying to be in my position Keep my shades on cause they're trying to see the vision You tell me bad man see I need your love See I need your love Me need you close to me Me tell her see me or stay on the road Bad energy stay far away Make you stay nothing was the same Now we're set for life I saw the turn up button and I pressed it twice You heard I'm in the club, they're my best advice It's put your shoes on and come and get your wife Cause we've been having sex just for exercise Every night men are doing sexercise She look into my eyes now she's mesmerized She tell me bad man see I need your love
