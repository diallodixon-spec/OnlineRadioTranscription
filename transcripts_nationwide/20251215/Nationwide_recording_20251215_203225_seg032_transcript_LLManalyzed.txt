20251215 203225 It only makes me stronger when you put me down So go ahead and tell the town You're doing me a favor when you push me round Cause every time you knock me down I get stronger and stronger You can take away my money, you can take away my ride You can take my friends, you can take my bride But you can't take my talent and my values and my tribe And you can't broke my spirit and my will to stay alive You can take away my jewels, take away my clothes The diamonds and the rubies you can take where y'all are dose But you can't take the thing me have or keep me on my toes This song is dedicated as a message to my foes You don't remember this number when you put me down
