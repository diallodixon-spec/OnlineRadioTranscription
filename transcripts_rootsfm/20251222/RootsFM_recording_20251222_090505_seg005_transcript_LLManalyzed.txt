20251222 090505 I've never seen you shine so bright You were amazing I've never seen so many people want to be there by your side And when you turned to me and smiled You took my breath away I have never had such a feeling Such a feeling of complete and utter love As I do tonight Lady in red Is dancing with me Chica-chica There's nobody here It's just you and me You know how love was meant to be The kind of love that lasts forever
