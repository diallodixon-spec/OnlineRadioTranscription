20251225 193621 I got a call from an old friend We laughed about how we had changed But I could tell Things weren't going as well as he claimed He tried to hide his feelings But they only gave him away The longer I listened, the more I kept wishing that I knew the right words to say Can you reach my friend? Brain is searching to an end. Lord, I know you love him. Help him understand.
