20251226 205043 I feel so unsure As I take your hand And lead you to the dance floor As the music dies Something in your eyes Calls to mind a silver screen And all it's said goodbye I'm never gonna dance again Guilty feet have got no rhythm What would say is easy to pretend I know you're not a fool You should have known better than to cheat and play Wasted chance that I'd been given So I'm never gonna dance again This is the way I dance with you
