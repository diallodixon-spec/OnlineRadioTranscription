20251219 145539 Look at me now, look at me now Look at me now and I'll tell you my life Where they used to come from, I don't know No one used to come from me, my life was so lonely Look at me now look at me now, where they treat me less than gold. Put me in a box like a rectangle. Oh, oh, look at me now. Look at me now. And I tell you my life, where they used to come on me. Go on, no one use to come on me, my life was so lonely. Look at me know, look at me know.
