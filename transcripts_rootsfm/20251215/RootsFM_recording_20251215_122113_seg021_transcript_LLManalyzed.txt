20251215 122113 The widow in the gospel is praised because she refused to offer excuse and chose to offer love. On the other hand, the scribes and the teachers of the law were condemning and they were condemned because they always evoked excuses for their duties rather than love. Excuses do not save. Excuses prolong evil, excuses prolong mediocrity. Love saves because love forgives. Today, the widow reminds us, number one, giving makes you happier. Giving can not only create positive feeling in the person who receives, but also the person who gives. Number two, giving is contagious. Giving truly is the gift that keeps on giving.
