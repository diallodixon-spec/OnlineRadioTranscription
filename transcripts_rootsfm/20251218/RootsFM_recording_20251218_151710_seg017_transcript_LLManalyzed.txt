20251218 151710 When the world sits in And you'd like to find a way To show the things that words can't say Why don't you Give love on Christmas Day Oh, the man on the street and the couple upstairs Oh, need to know there's someone who cares Give love on Christmas Day No greater gift is there than love But the world needs his love If the world needs your love Why don't you give love on Christmas Day? Oh, every little child or sad Disney has room for your love underneath this tree. Give love on Christmas Day.
