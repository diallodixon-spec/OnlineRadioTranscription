20251225 104226 Jamon who you want, why not who you like? Why not who you like, like yourself Like yourself, like yourself Until the party's done Jamon who ya want, jamon who ya want Why not who ya like, why not who ya like? Like yourself, I like it Me cooler ready Me ice done, me punching that's automatic. I have a lightning jumbie, a kind of energy inside me, and it ready for the rum, ready ready for the rum. Ready ready for the rum ready for the action, a spiritual encounter in me soul.
