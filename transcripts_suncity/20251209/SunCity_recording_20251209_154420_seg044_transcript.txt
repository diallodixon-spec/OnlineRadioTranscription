Let's go. Left foot, right foot, levitating. Pop stars, do a leap with the baby. I had to lace my shoes for all the blessings I was chasing. If I ever slip, I fall into a better situation. So catch up. Go put some cheese on it. Get out and get your bread up. They always leaving you, father. You run together. Weight of the world on my shoulders. I kept my head up. Now, baby, stand up. Because, girl, you want me. I want you, baby. I'm sugar boos. I'm levitating. The Milky Way. We're gonna get it. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I see you don't reply Cause your lips are saying one thing, but your eyes don't lie Hope I'm not mistaken, don't tell me that you're taking, not enough
