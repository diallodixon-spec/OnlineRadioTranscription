2025-12-12 14:57:53 Now that's Christmas to me Another year gone by New Year's almost here Merry Christmas all Happy, Happy New Year Jolly good time of the year Sleigh bells in the snow Everywhere you go People having fun But it's a merry time of the year A jolly good time of year We're all just like children Come that one special day Giving gifts just like children Ain't that the Christmas way?
