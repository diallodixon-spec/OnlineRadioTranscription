We'll make you a prayer friend Call if your self lost and we'll make you make news No one see you on the highway across Bad mind, dem a prayer envy dem trust Dem a prayer every time I change the shoes Dirty mind, they are rude but me know fear Facts say some real thugs they hot dey Nuff of dem well won't see you drop one kilo weed But some real thugs dey hot dey Me no care where bad mind people want to see Me all the time But you gotta look with more than your eyes Judge a blessing this ain't no luck Wear a follow suit when your mind made up a scene Papa's turned to kings and kings return
