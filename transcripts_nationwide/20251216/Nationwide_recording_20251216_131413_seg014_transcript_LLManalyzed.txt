20251216 131413 Where you at? Now you said you go to church Stop the slang and find a real job and go to work You say you stay out the streets and spend more time with me Take away my, take away my girl I still kiss your head in the morning Make you breakfast in bed while you're yawning And I don't do everything how you want it But you can't say your man don't be on it Cause I know true love ain't easy Girl, I know it's you cause you complete me And I just don't want to leave Even though I can't have that girl Even though I give you reasons Cause baby sometimes I can tell just by your face this part of us been gone for so long
