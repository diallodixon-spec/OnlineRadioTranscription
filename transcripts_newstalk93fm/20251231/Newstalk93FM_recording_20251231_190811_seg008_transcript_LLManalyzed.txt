Go on, turn it up until you feel it in your spine. Excess amount of the style manna bring. Boom, tune, a play, gal, balance, and redeem. Redeem. Redeem. Earth start to shake and the world start to spin. Can't take no break, lift it up, start again. Well consistent from this, you can depend. You look quick from your ends. Let me know what you feel.
