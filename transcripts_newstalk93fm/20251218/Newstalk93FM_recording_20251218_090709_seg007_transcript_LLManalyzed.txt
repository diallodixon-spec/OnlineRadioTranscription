20251218 090709 And dream, dream, dream I have a dream that someday We'll all walk hand in hand I have a dream That someday This is going to be a better land. Maybe you can't see my meaning. You can't see my dream. But I'm sure someday you'll understand. It can all be better if we get it together. And dream, dream, dream. Oh, how sweet the words love.
