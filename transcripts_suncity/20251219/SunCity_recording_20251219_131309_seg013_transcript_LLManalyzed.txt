20251219 131309 We like excitement, we like vibes, and everybody like a nice pop-up town square activity. So that's what Bat Bone is bringing to the people as a new brand in the tonic liqueur space, in the tonic wine space. And we're very happy to be representing where they park through this brand. Okay. Very nice. All right. So if someone wants to pick up a bottle this Christmas, where can they find Bat Bone Tonic Liqueur? Well, anywhere that you buy your tonic wines, you should be able to find this product. So first of all it's in your corner bar. If you don't reach a corner bar or you're coming to shop yet, you need to ask the buyer what they're waiting on because they are missing out. You've gotten some great feedback. You can also get it in your supermarkets, in your wholesale. You can also buy it in your duty free. For those of you that are flying out, going abroad or you have family that's flying out and want to pick up some, you can also get it at our duty-free locations in Kingston and Montego Bay. But essentially, Sondra, it's all over the island. It's very easy to access. So definitely, you should be logging in and checking out this product. Okay, very nice.
