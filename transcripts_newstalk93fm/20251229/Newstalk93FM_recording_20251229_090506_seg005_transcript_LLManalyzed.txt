20251229 090506 So I don't think no such party can find me. And the bass knock was so out of nature, so God won't let me leave. I don't know if I'll survive. Song after song, wine after wine. I go sing strong and fit for life. Weak like the masses, kryptonite. You can't find me, we're bound for shaking. Highest meeting, people fighting. So complain if they want to know. Tell them you can't find me. Out on the road, I'm ready to walk. Chest left, work, time to free up. God, I won't let me go. Go send a search party to find me. I out on the road already Tell them that this old guy hanged me, hey, hey, hey
