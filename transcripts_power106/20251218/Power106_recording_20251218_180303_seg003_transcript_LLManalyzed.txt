20251218 180303 We have plenty to say about over the next two hours. To my friends and supporters in the diaspora, in Canada, the United States, the United Kingdom, and elsewhere in the world, particularly the Eastern Caribbean, and we are happy that you are able to join us because we know you have choices, but you elected to medicine to power 106 at this particular point in time. All right, so we have some conversations coming up for you as usual on our show. And we'll be getting to that in a little while. But we have music as well. And we've been Christmas season. You know, I absolutely loved Christmas until I started paying the bills. It became a little less enjoyable. I had a wonderful time as a child, that Christmas time, but once I started earning an income and having to foot the bill, well, anyway, I'm not being serious here. I mean, I enjoy it anyway. I absolutely love Christmas.
