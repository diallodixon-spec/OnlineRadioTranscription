I think love has brought us here I remember not too long ago I was just a lonely person With a lonely heart Yeah And I was hoping there could one day be a chance For me to get the love that I've been missing Sometimes love takes a long time But wait for love and you're gonna get the chance to love Wait for love, wait for love
