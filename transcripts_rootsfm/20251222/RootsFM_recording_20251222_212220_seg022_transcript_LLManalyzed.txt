20251222 212220 You found another home I know you're not alone On the night shift Gonna be some sweet time Rolling down on the night shift On the night shift I bet you're singing proud I bet you I bet you could cry. Oh, yeah. Gonna be a long night. Gonna be fun. Gonna be all right. On the night shift, on the night shift, you found another home. I know you're not alone on the night shift. Gonna miss your sweet your sweet voice. That soulful noise. On the night shift. We all remember you. Remember you, remember you. Your songs are coming.
