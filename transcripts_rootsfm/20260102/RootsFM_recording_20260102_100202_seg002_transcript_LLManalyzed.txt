20260102 100202 Give thanks to the elements of life. Eat air, earth and water. But I give thanks to music, you know. But through music almost I, I just last said the first, I made an instrument to manifest the holy works. Omnipotent, omnipresent, the will of creation. Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be upful and right. Of this time forth, and forever more, I be forever old in the faith.
