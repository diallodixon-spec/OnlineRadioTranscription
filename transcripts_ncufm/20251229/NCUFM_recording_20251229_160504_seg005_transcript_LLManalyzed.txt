20251229 160504 They're all from the C470 Adventist Church. I want to wish them a long and happy and healthy life as they celebrate another milestone in their lives. May God continue to bless them and grant them the strength as they seek to carry out their work in the church. May He grant them a great celebration. I also want to wish Neville and Verona Hardware from Oak Bay in Portland a great celebration. They celebrated their 43rd wedding anniversary yesterday. I wish them God's richest blessings and may God continue to bless their union so that as they live together they will live in love and in harmony
