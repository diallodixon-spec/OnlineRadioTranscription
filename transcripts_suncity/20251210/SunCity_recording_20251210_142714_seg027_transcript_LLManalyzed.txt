============================================================

I said I am strong enough I know to pull my own weight And I love China I know how to hold my faith All right then, you can't fake your real true life like a show You fool some people but some people will know say you a fraud Fake, no make the mistake and go give them any power to determine your fate. And give them a inch and them take a yard. Give them a yard and them give you a bit of yard. But are you be careful how you step? No work to regret. And make sure you shuffle in the deck. Because I will never go dancing. You could be my soldier Without uniform Fighting in my army of love Once you are aware No, the rules are not allowed
