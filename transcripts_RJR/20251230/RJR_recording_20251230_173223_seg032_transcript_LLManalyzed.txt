JPS is urging motorists to slow down when approaching JPS work sites, obey all warning signs and traffic instructions, and give crews the space they need to work safely. By doing so, motorists will help protect lives and support the work being done to restore and maintain electricity across the island. Slow down, move with care, help everyone get home safely. JPS rebuilding together, powering, powering what matters life is fragile. Pedestrians, stay alert. Drivers, slow down. Rest if you're tired and never drink and drive. One careless decision can change a family forever. Let's have a safe and prayerful Christmas and a crash-free 2020.
