Don't tell me what your friends are buying Cause money doesn't grow on trees Tell me about the things that excite you And make you tingle with delight Little darling, tell me where to hold and touch you So when it comes to loving, I'm alright Alright, I'm alright I'll make you tickle with the light Show you're loving all the time I'm not in a position to maintain you The way that you're accustomed to Can't take you out to fancy places
