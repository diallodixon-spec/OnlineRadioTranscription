============================================================

Hello? Alright, let's set the brake. You're listening to Power 106 FM. Use pedestrian crossings and stay alert at night. Darkness and busy streets make it harder for drivers to see people crossing. Always use designated pedestrian crossings and wait until vehicles fully stop. Drivers should also reduce speed and stay alert in shopping areas. That was a Christmas Road Safety Tip from your friends at Power106FM.
