20251218 134923 So you care about me, but from what I see, I'm feeling all that. So I disagree. I gave you all my love and understanding. Yet you treated me like your enemy. So leave me alone. I don't want anything from you. Just go back where you came from. This house is no longer your home. You're not welcome, no, no, no more. No more. Every sound. Oh, you couldn't hurt me so bad. Leave me, don't break and treat me. Oh, no, no. I wish I was in love with you.
