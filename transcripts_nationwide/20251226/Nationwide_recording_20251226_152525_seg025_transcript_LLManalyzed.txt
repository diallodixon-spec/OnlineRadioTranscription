20251226 152525 We made your whole life trying to change what they hear from what's being. You may have put your whole life into a man loving what you thought it could have been. I want us when you change and you don't feel as good as you used to before. And everything you used to say, everything you used to do came right out the door., I want you to be the one That's what you tell everyone around you But you know they've heard it all before Come on, get your way, get it When love's all about you Walk away and it can't help who it loves And you find yourself givingivin' it all away for you
