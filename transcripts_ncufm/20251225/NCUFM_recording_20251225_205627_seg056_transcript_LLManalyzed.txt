20251225 205627 I want to testify that I've been wind-swept, I've been battered, but I'll wait to His cross. He gives me patience in the midst of, midst of the storm. And one more thing, you see, when I come to the end of my journey all of living seems but one moment when my doctor shakes his head and looks for Lord. I know Jesus Christ, he makes my bedside, he makes it a cathedral of faith and love, and he gives me peace.
