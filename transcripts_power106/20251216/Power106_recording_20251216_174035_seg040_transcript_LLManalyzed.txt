20251216 174035 beautiful and really want to thank you the government of Jamaica it's most fitting and deserving indeed for for for Jimmy Cliff to be accorded that official celebration of his life once again if persons can't make it in person how can they be a part of the occasion and especially for those individuals who don't live in the corporate area or who may be overseas. It's DreamWive, JCDC Jamaica on all platforms. Okay, beautiful. All right. Thank you so much for the very useful information. Keep up the work, Minister. I know it's a busy time, but of course, good work leads to great outcomes. What's your favorite Jimmy Klipson? My favorite? The same one that you picked, the harder they come. Sure as there's a pie in the sky I'm going to get my share what's mine and then as the harder they come the harder they fall one and all. So tomorrow we will see
