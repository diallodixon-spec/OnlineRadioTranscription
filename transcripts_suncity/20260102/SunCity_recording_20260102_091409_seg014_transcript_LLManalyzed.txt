20260102 091409 Believe in the words, the power of the tongue and keep praying a lot because trust me, prayer do work. And your girl McAdaman is telling you that from the experience I have and still praying up to now and holding the faith, here I am still standing and the Lord with Maka Diamond. A very interesting one, I must say. I'm happy that I played that one. If you're just joining us, it is the Hello Jamaica show. It's a girl, Queen Jojo, holding it down for son Diamond. She'll be back on Monday. Yay. So you can look forward to having your host back on Monday. It is 2026.
