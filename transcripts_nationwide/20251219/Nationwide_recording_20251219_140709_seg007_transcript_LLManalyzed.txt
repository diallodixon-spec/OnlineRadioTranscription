20251219 140709 Under the mistletoe Shawty with you Shawty with you The wise men followed us, The wise men followed us The way I followed my heart And it led me to a miracle Don't you buy me nothing I am feeling one thing Your lips on my lips But to Merry Merry Christmas It's the most beautiful time of the year Lights fill the streets, spend so much time I should be playing in the winter snow I would be under the mistletoe I don't wanna miss out on the holidays
