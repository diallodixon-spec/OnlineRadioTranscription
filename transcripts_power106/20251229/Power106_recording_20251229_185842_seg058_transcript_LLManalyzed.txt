20251229 185842 Yeah, Leeds are tough right now. They're playing very, very confident. Liverpool barely got the bit of them the last time out. But I think that Liverpool is starting to find the form now. The players that they brought in are starting to understand the requirements of Ernest Lott. I think that they're coming together. I think it will be a tough game for Liverpool, but at Anfield, I think they'll make this one probably 2-1. Yes, all right. Sunderland, without their African players, will face Manchester City at the Stadium of Light. Yeah, Sunderland is tough. They haven't lost very many games. But I think that this Manchester City team is rounding into form. And based on what the results are tomorrow with the 1 versus 3, that they, in position number number two will be looking to go top of the league. They'll be very motivated and I think that Sunderland could find that it's going to be just too difficult against this Manchester City team that is on the hunt.
