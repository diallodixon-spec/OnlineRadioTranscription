20251226 133026 This Christmas, choose life. As we recover from Hurricane Melissa's devastation, we're reminded that life is fragile. Pedestrians, stay alert. Drivers, slow down. Rest if you're tired and never drink and drive. One careless decision can change a family forever and prosperity. Enjoy a safe and peaceful holiday. This Christmas let Ho meet you at the door. Travel safe.
