20251215 155726 Everybody's talking all this stuff about me now They just let me live I don't need permission, made my own decisions That's my karagatil They say I'm crazy I really don't care That's my karakatil They say i'm nasty Three Lines Mondays. So real, but they don't understand me Or really don't know the deal about a wrestler Trying hard to make it right And I'm on the go before I feel despised, sir Everybody's talking all this stuff about me Why don't they just let me go?
