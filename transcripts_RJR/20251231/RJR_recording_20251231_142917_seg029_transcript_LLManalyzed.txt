20251231 142917 I'll pick up this one from the top. I'm staying right here, folks. We do have a guest coming in. I'm gonna stay right here. This is a public service announcement from JPS. JPS is urging motorists to slow down when approaching JPS work sites, obey all warning signs and traffic instructions, and give crews the space they need to work safely. By doing so, motorists help protect lives and support the work being done to restore and maintain electricity across the island. Slow down. Move with care. Help everyone get home safely.
