Come on. We're not playing. No playing around. No playing. Reggae boys, we need to go to the World Cup. We're after. World Cup we say. After. The only advice I give Jamaican people, I'm telling you this morning, when you're not going to the World Cup, don't bother the accent. Don't bother the accent! Some of them, some of the players can't break out from it. Not even the players they may attack. People we are traveling to. We just visit for the World Cup. No, and we are not full colors. If they say hi man, where are you going? I'm here for the World Cup, no do it. From your twang, the man is going to say run off. We are full colors daily because we have to represent, right? They have to ask a question. Good. From your shoes to your hat. Right. From your come and say oh you're here for the match. Done, argument done. Easiest thing that daily. Argument done. Some people are giving people them questions. No for them to see them and say okay this is how we're okay. Answer like you're confident man. Yes. Are you here for the match? Yes.
