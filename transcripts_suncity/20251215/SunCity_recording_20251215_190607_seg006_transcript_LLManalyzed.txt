20251215 190607 Minister Dr. Andrew Holness has sought to reassure Jamaicans that there is no ban on festive celebrations this holiday season. Speaking at a Christmas treat for shelterees at Petersfield High School in Westmoreland recently, Dr. Holness emphasized that once the events are properly organized and align with public safety requirements, there should be no objections. He also advised that promoters looking to stage events in communities still facing infrastructural challenges after Hurricane Melissa must address several practical considerations. The police have said that they will give permits for parties so long as the promoters make the proper arrangements. Some places don't have the light, so if you're going to keep party, you have to put up light, you have to get one generator. People have to have water, they use bathroom facilities. And some of the entertainment areas are sometimes targeted by criminals, and therefore you have to prepare for the safety of the patrons.
