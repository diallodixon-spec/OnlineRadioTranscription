20251226 150805 Hey, check it in. Good afternoon. Eight minutes past the three o'clock hour. Certain City Radio 104.9 FM. It is a ton of Friday, you know we do on a Friday. And no, it's not a Monday. You don't have to check the calendar. You know how we do it, all right? We just give you a little of this, a little of that. And that's how we feel like we started. I mean, old school style.
