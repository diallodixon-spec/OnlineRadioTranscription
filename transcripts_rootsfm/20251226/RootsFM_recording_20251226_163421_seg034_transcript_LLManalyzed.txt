Big, big mean trouble, trouble, trouble Big, big trouble So listen now, I wake up and I don't know where I'll be I don't know what I'll do, what I'll do if I say I don't need a car, I'll be there from your seat What a calamity, how this happen to me, I don't need that I'll tell her, say I drugged them, drug me Because I don't know how I'll reach here But that heart, it believes, so she's not gonna believe it I swear, but God, no, she can can't believe. So me, drop a three-pointer, make some money out of it. Oh, Lord, I'm gonna wake up to the sun in my eye, and I'm gonna blow fire to my skull. Oh, Lord. I'm in trouble, trouble, trouble. Big, big trouble. Lord, I'm in trouble. Trouble, trouble, big, big trouble.
