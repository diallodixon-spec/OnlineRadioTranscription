20251219 174228 Darling, how I love you Gave all I had They tried to take me Now I'm a small man But that's the way to love That's how I feel in my heart. I've got to say, oh, how I suffer. Oh, how I cry in the gaze of my pride just to be by her side. I knew so very much pride that love was really mine. I'd never say no other words, no other words.
