I'm falling in a quicksand No offense, it's my father, little friction But if a band you want to build, go check, map the building down Hey, I'm down, pull your chest Me no give up, if your world be flexed Man, a star boy, better don't forget TV, you no give it up, let me call the dex Bounce on me, bounce on me now I say stand up, but no drum for me now Bounce on me now, yeah, you ready yeah, yeah Be a big ass, mami square, yeah Get there anything you like As long as you all right and me all right Me know what you want, that's what me like, yo To a home of the lies Plus you bump off the proper signs So mark it up, me day behind, yo Slap it in, snap a random picture She put it on any site, mami square Your skin clean, thick dyes Blush bright, so me nama try and sweat
