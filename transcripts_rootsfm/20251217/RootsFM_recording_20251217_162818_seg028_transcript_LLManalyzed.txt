20251217 162818 I cannot deny this feeling I'm feeling inside No one can take your place You cannot take your space It's a fact I cannot erase You are the one that makes me smile Make me float like a boat upon the night Girl, you are my African queen The girl of my dreams You take me where I've been. You make my heart go ting-a-ling-a-ling. You are my African Queen. The girl of my dreams, and you remind me of a thing. And that is the African New Day. Oh, oh, oh, oh. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh, oh.
