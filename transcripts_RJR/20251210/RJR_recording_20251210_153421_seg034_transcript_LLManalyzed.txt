All right. No, we're not on our own at all. Not at all. We've got Nicolene Taylor with us. She works closely with individuals and families on practical financial planning and she's here to help us make smart money decisions. As we head toward the end of the year, it's never too late to make smart money decisions, you know. I've made some for 2025. Now when you look back, you say, look, why me do that? Tell you. But it late for a shower every day. I like to say hi Nicoline. How are you this afternoon? I am doing great. How are you folks doing today? We are good. Thank you so much for joining us. And thanks for the energy. Thank you guys. Listen, the season is here.
