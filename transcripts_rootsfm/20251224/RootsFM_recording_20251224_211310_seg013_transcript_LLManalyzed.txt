20251224 211310 Here comes Santa Claus, here comes Santa Claus, right down Santa Claus Lane Mixing and blitzing and all his reindeer pulling on the reins Gone away is the bluebird, here to stay is the new bird He sings a love song as we go along Walking in a winter wonderland In the meadow we can build a snowman Pretend that he is causing ground He'll say are you married? We'll say no man But you can do the job when you're in town Later on, we'll conspire As we dream by the fire To face unafraid the plans that we've made Walking in a winter wonderland In the middle we can build a snowman
