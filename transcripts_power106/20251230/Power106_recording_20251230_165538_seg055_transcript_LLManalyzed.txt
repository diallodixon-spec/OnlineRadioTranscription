20251230 165538 Thank you so very much for coming to us here on both sides of the story. Jesse Blake is back with you tomorrow and of course we will continue to allow you the opportunity to share your thoughts and ideas with us and to just get us through these periods when we really need to be embracing each other and conversing with each other and as I am encouraging you to do to take it slow as well Yes, slow and steady. That's what does it remember that story of the tortoise and the hare? Yes Tortoise won the race taking it slow and steady So that's what we want you to do. To take us out of here, Germaine Edwards let it go. Up next, the news at five.
