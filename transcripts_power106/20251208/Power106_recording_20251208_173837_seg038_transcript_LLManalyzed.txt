============================================================

I could hardly believe it When I heard the news today I had to come and get it straight from you They said you were leaving Someone swept your heart away From that look on your face I see it's true So tell me all about it. Tell me about the plans you're making. Oh, tell me one thing more before I go. Tell me how am I supposed to live without you? Now that I've been loving you so long How am I supposed live without you?
