20251216 204534 You're listening to Power 106 FM. The time is now 8.45. One great song follows another, another, another, one great song follows another on Power 106. I did my best, but I guess my best wasn't good enough Cause here we are back where we were before Seems nothing ever changes We're back to being strangers Wondering if we oughta stay or head on out the door
