20260102 200406 in our society today is the use of technology. We talk about programming, the use of coding and artificial intelligence, and more of those conversations are being done at this time. So it is also important for us to prepare our students for the future by establishing foundational competencies which will enable them to be flexible to adapt to emerging technologies and new situations. So I know sometimes when you see them around their computer devices, you know, you probably wonder if they're wasting time. Parents at home, but perhaps they're not doing that. So how can we encourage our children, encourage our students to tap into the technology? So we're focusing on CXC-IT this evening, which is designed to provide knowledge and skills in the essential information technology domains, which include computer fundamentals, problem solving, network, web technologies, productivity tools, and as I mentioned, the whole matter of cyber security as well.
