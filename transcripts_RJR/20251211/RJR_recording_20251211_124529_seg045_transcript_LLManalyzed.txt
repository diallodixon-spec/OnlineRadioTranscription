Bye. Dean's Pharmacy in Papin supports our men in the fight. Visit digiceljamaica.com for ways to win. At the Accounting General's department, we know many of our pensioners have faced serious challenges with power, internet, and daily routines disrupted. That's why the AGD is coming to you with Phase 2 of the Mobile Life Certificate Drive, ensuring you remain connected to your well-earned pension benefits. On Friday, December 5, we'll be at the Trelawney Parish.
