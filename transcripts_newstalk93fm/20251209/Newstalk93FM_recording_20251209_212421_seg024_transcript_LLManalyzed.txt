They stood by me before my exoneration They believed I was innocent So I'm not here for judgement, no But if you can't be good then just be better at it Everyone's got bodies in the attic Or took somebody's man Will take you by the hand And soon you'll learn the art Of never getting caught I think I like my friends cancel.
