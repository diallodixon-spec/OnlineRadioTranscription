20251217 143226 Today, thank you for your work. Your work matters, matters to all of us. You are protectors, yes, but you're also teachers, mentors, problem solvers, peace builders, and friends. Your impact cannot be measured in arrest rates only, but in the lives redirected, in youths inspired, and the hope you continue to restore. Continue to serve with pride. Let integrity be your compass, especially in a world that seemed to celebrate the lack of integrity as a bout of honor. Let compassion be and love be your legacy and know that Lascaux stands beside you. Not just today, not just tomorrow, not just next week, not just next month, not just next year and the year after and the year after.
