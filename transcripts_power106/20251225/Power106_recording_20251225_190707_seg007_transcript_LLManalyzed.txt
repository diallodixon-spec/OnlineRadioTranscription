20251225 190707 at a critical moment. Jodko came here for her back to school and trust me, it was very good for the children and now coming back a second time it would be bigger and better. So I just want to say thanks to Jodko for coming out and bringing the Christmas cheer because a lot of people are saying, oh we don't have any Christmas because we don't have light, we don't have water and so I want to commend you guys for coming from so far and we do appreciate it in this little community. Echoing her sentiments was Kadeen Williams who stressed that the devastation they experienced will not be the only memory in the festive season. Most of the children said mom they can't have a Christmas without light but this event I can't even explain what it has done for the children. At least they see that there's still a Christmas even after Hurricane Melissa. Certainly athletes were among those severely impacted by Hurricane Melissa and the outreach initiative would not have been complete without extending support
