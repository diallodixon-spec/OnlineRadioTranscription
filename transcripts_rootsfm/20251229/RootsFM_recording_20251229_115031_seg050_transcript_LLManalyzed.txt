20251229 115031 from my patients, just when I ask them about a particular side effect and how they manage it. Sometimes the way they manage it, it's really alarming. Yes. So yes, that is very important. We're talking about diabetes and how we're managing that in this time and season. And it's not just for now, but we recognize that it's the condition that persons live with, and therefore the monitoring and the managing of this disease is important or this condition. We don't want some persons shy away when they hear it's a disease, but this condition, you really want to have full hands on it and to ensure that you are knowing what's happening with you and how you will manage it. We're going to go to Purr and when we come back I'm going to ask Dr. Daley just to share a takeaway with our listeners but we go to Purr now by Bishop Dr. Michael Webster. Stay tuned.
