20251215 113026 I do not understand these things. You get 2028 to do something, you do it by 2020 because didn't it drop to like 62? Of course and then they make the whole place mash up and then they come back and say you have to do it. That's why I'm going to tell you about this monumental exercise in stupidity. That's the point we are making. Yep. Yep. You never have to do it that time. And you did it. Made the country's infrastructure vulnerable. And everything mashed up now and then you come back and say, boy, we have to go to 2030. Stupidity. Yep. That's what I've been saying a long time. Tell me, what this means? Had Melissa not come, common sense wouldn't come? Melissa bring some common sense? No, the brothers go under the same thing. Yeah, that is what I tell you. Melissa will bring common sense to the thing. And we're still not seeing enough common sense because we still hear people are talking foolishness. Yep. So, yep. Yep.
