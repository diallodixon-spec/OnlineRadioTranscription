Your Prada dress or your Gucci bag. Whether polo, jeans, or a doobie bag. You'll hold the door, all right. We come a new tribe. We hold it down for the night. Big move, got the fifth. G-life, you got the willy. And girl, you got the gift. Turn it over the page, usher in all the y'all to the brand new gauge. Status really don't matter, everybody. I'll see you guys in the next one.
