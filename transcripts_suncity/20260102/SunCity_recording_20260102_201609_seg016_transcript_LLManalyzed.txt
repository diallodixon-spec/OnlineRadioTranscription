20260102 201609 Hey, what's a safe travel on the gravel Queen Jodie? I ain't shoot the rhyme. Robin chose me. Some crack running like a nosebleed. Life ain't great now, but it's much improved. Your album dropping this summer, that sucks for you. Cause this is Bubba's moment. I put my m*** on it. I said my momma, it seems as if I love her, don't it?
