I'll take you for a ride, then we'll deal you up with a little side. Don't worry about your man tonight, cause I know I'll show the money all right. Make you sad and bring the light. Love me, you're very cute. We love each other like one, but it's probably true. He loves me far, so catch me who? He said he'd be a champion honeymoon. I need you like make desperate So me and you, we touch today I need you like, make desperate Me believe in you boo I'm a good vibe, up in my ride, like a bike, I bet that someone's talking in my mind, I'ma put up on a flight, let it roll, let it stick with me
