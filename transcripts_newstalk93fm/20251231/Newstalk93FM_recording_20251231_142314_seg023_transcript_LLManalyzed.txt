20251231 142314 Cause when I'm with you I just know I'm fine, know I'm fine You take all the pressure off my mind, all the time Patient in time when I be going out my mind Say from the problems I don't worry cause I'm hard to find I hope you good, I hope you well, I hope you lit I miss your touch, I miss your smell, I miss your lips Maybe grab a drink, maybe grab some food, don't be a stranger I know it's hard though Hello. Hello. Hello. Use me up, use me up.
