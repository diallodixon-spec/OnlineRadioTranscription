20251219 171511 The king of endless work No one could express How much you deserve Though I'm weak and poor All I have is yours Every single breath I'll bring you more than a song, for a song in itself is not what you have required. You'll touch much deeper within, through the wavelengths of you. You'll look in you in my heart I'm coming back to the heart of worship And it's all about you
