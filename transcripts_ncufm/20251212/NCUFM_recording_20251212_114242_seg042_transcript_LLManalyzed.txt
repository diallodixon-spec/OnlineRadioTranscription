20251212 114242 Just Thy great name we praise! Unrest, unhaste, and silent as lie, Nor want nor waste, thou rulest in mind. Thy justice like mountains high soaring above, thy clouds which are fountains of goodness and love. To all life thou givest, to both great and small, In all life thou livest, the true life of all.
