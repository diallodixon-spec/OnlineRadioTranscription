20251218 192816 Christmas light, casting love so bright. Together we hold our smiles in the night. Join in every eye, this time feels so right. In the arms of family, everything's inside. Stories unfolding by the fire's gentle gleam. Threads of our lives like a warm tender dream dream. Your kindness, a beacon, your calmness, a guide. With your laughter, a journey, we joyfully ride. Oh're creative It paints the night anew You're an adventurin' spirit always breakin' through With every story told and every song sung
