They don't know the meaning of water nor soap I don't have time for the rigmarole Taking off my coat, I'm clearing my throat Certified diamonds like the songs I wrote Look at my wrist, check out the light show Can you handle this? I don't know You can meet me up at the pad Knock him out the box with a chocolate kiss Oh, I ain't saying too much. I like I'm dangerous. Looking for the dangerous side. I like, I'm dangerous. Hey! I'm looking for the dangerous sidewalls. I said, I like I'm danger'm dangerous. Dangerous. Dangerous. Fresh out of fencing, now I'm just plain. That was just a castle and an evil king made my escape.
