20251222 124424 Another one, let me bring it up. This one says, good morning, sir, good morning. Listen, in Kingston, is there any law that can be levied against taxi drivers who look clear that they don't want to carry mail passengers in their front seat? I witnessed this recently on the Price Right Half-Wheeled Taxi. Surprisingly, the other passengers in the taxi kept silent. When are we, other people, going to take a united stand against certain forms of discrimination? You know, the thing about it, you know, you go on the basis of caring people. You know what's rich? It is discrimination. The problem is that because it happens in such a way, it just take time and more to try and prosecute that in the courts. Because, you know, when the electric goes along, the regulatory authorities should be made aware of these things. They can get evidence of it. They should something that could also fit your license. Yes? We take a break and we'll back at you.
