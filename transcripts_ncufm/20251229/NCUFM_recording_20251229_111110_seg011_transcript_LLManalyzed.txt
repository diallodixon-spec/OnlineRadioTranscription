20251229 111110 Cause I know with you I can go, go Ever since that day I asked you into my heart My world has changed, so promise me you'll never part Cause I love without you Easy to see I love without you And there's no So don't ever go, go away. Say don't ever go away. You picked me up those times, I'm dead.
