20251222 213623 Something I'd like for you to hear in only your ears alone. Secretly, I've been admiring you intensely. So much so that I'd like to settle down with you and make a home. You are my first friend. My first smile in my morning cup of tea. Yours is the love that I pray before I go to sleep from the day I heard you speak, I didn't know the song was sweet, to be hearing you in each speed of my heart.
