20260101 203026 My fellow Jamaicans at home and abroad, Happy New Year to you all. While we have collectively and individually endured many challenges, 2025 tested our strength and resolve in ways none of us could have imagined when our country was devastated by a ferocious Category 5 hurricane on the 28th October. Yet, amidst the intense hardship and destruction, the true spirit of our people shone through. Acts of unspoken bravery in the hurricane saved many lives, only to be followed by a whirlwind of philanthropic generosity. As Jamaicans at home and abroad got busy in trying to assist our families and fellow citizens who need our help. We rallied behind the black, green and gold in a torrent of love, caring and support for our fellow Jamaicans in need.
