20251218 170104 Welcome to Sleek Radio, 93 FM. You come alive with one wine baby With you I want to dance the night away One jam turn a lifetime baby So don't feel away You don't like the fast life The look on the bright side I go take the blame I just want you come and light it up Just a little winding up Come and meet me behind the truck and we rev it up Whole day, keep throwing it back I know why you stop, baby no way
