20251219 164939 What if you don't feel like I do? All the dreams I've made will not come true. I love you. And I always have hope and you feel the same. It would be so sad to lose our friendship this way. But it would be a shame to never know what we could become if we were in love. You're everything I wanna be. I have grown so close to you. Could it be that you feel the same? You're everything I've ever dreamed. And I want you to want me. It started as a friendship. Could it end as a love never ending?
