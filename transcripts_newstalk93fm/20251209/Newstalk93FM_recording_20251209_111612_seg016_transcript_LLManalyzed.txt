They actually quote-unquote threw it out, you know, and then he took it to the Supreme Court to walk with us through that and what happened yesterday and where are we now. All right. First of all, let me say that the matter that was decided yesterday is Paul Buchanan versus the constituted authority. So it ultimately concerns Paul Buchanan versus Andrew Holness, but Andrew Holness was not a party to what is taking place now. So he need not be in the court or anything like that? He was not in court. He didn't need to be in court. He did need to be represented. He's not a named litigant. He's not the applicant nor the respondent in this matter. The matter concerns the constituency, but at the stage that it was at the decision yesterday, it's Paul Buchanan versus the constituted authority.
