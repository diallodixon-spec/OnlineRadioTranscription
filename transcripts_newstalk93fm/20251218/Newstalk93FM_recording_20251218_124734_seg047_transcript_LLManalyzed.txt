20251218 124734 Now the weekends I've spent at the beach All the riverside she's always up for the ride And she likes to be up in the hills Far away from the noise when she just wanna chill She wants to hear the birds and bees when they sing And I'm glad that she does cause it's my kind of thing You can call it a perfect match I'm just happy that you let me in. Finally, she loves me now. And I believe somehow, there ain't no perfect play. Finally, she wants to come and stay. Can't wait another day. And now I don't feel so far away. Party one day, party two nights, party three nights, party four tries. I must say, it felt a kind of way. But it was only you in my eyes. I felt bad when you were in my arms.
