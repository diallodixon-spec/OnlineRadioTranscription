Keep moving! Regular exercise can help you reach or maintain a healthy weight. Exercise also cuts stress and helps you control blood pressure, cholesterol, and triglyceride levels. Get at least 30 minutes a day of aerobic exercise, 5 days a week. Try walking, dancing, low-impact aerobics, swimming, tennis or a stationary bicycle. Start out more slowly if you aren't active now. You can break up the 30 minutes say by taking a 10-minute walk after every meal. Include strength and training and stretching on some days. This diabetes tip was brought to you by Livewell Pharmacy.
