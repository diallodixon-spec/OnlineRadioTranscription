20251224 151607 Take me by the hand No more, show me You're okay, baby We'd always end up this way Me begging you every day The love that I cannot have Broke my heart in two halves Sun to day, one, two, four, five, nine, take it up and die Sun to day, no me, no earth, no mine And it keeps me moving Sun City! Sun City!
