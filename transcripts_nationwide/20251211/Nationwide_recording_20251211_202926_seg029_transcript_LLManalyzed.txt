So I don't say, well, it's hard. Jackson and Nango really don't talk much Patois. But my decision was, I'm not going to hear the child say something in Patois and say, that is bad language. What I'm going to do, because this is my fundamental philosophy of parenting in terms of linguistics, I'm going to say, could you say that in English? Let's hear it in English and in Patois. Because I'm trying to raise a bilingual child or a multilingual child. So I'm trying to get him to appreciate How do you say that? So no, it's almost like it's funny because I'm Trying to get him to speak Patwa. So I'm like Daddy, I hit my head and I'm like, can you say that in Patwa?
