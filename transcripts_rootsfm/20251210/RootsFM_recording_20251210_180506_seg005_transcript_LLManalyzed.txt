They say chicken gun is literal, but me, it matters. They say mosquitoes carry a chicken gun, but do I that is hypothetical. Need further research so see it actual nor factual. By the way, they are the most South American Indian people living in Honduras and Nicaragua and they have a mosquito. I wonder if they have a chicken gun, they come round here. Then again, scripture says, a long, long time mosquito, a bite, a bite, and a bite people.
