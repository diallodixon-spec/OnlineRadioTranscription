20251230 162818 Good afternoon to you. It's a drive on NCU FM. First day back to work, you know. After the vacation, we have homework helpers coming up next. Good afternoon to you, I know more and more individuals are getting to hear and see UFM. I say that because more and more individuals are getting to tune in day by day, getting back their signal. So welcome back on board the Drive. If just like me, you're really kind of just getting a chance to be back on, welcome back on Board the Drive, yeah.
