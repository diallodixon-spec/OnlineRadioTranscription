I always take notes. Every little thing teachers them say, I always write it down. As soon as I go, I change my clothes and I read through what I learned today. Whenever I have free time during the lunchtime, the classes I have before lunchtime, I just go through everything that I learned that day. Up until seasick time now, me and my peers, we go on calls, watch for deeper study in crop and animal production, business aspects and advanced management. So, his school-based assessment SBA was a loaded one.
