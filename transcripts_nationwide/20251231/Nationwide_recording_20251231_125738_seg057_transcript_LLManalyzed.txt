20251231 125738 The planet Earth turns slowly It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep Cause everything is never as it seems When I'm asleep Leave my door open just to crack Cause I feel like such an insomniac Why do I tire of counting sheep? We're not far too tired to fall asleep To ten million fireflies I'm weird cause I hate goodbyes I got misty eyes as they said farewell But I'll know where several are If my dreams get real bizarre Cause I saved a few and I keep them in a jar
