Free! Yes, you know, Christmas is coming! You know, in Jamaica? Criminal! You know, the kind of the things have a season! Suppose, too, December is a good season, you know, holiday season, but, you know, criminal, they are loud! You have a stamp out. So you are going to play this song. Lucifer, son of the morning. I'm gonna chase you out of earth. Yeah, Anthony McPherson locked in! Inside of the Sun City! I'm gonna put on an iron shirt, and chase Satan out of Earth. I'm gonna put an iron shirt on, and chase the devil out of Earth.
