20251231 132213 There are lots of signs in life, some that you may not like. You could be living this minute, the next minute you're gonna regret. Hold up your heads my brothers, be conscious my sisters, and by your works you should surely be paid Never try to lose the man with the anger The one who's got the tiger The one who sits high and he looks on low And if you ever lose the man who has the anger The one that's got the tiger Then you'll be someone that he don't know. Say a prayer and chant a song. You don't have to go to church, you'll be a Christian to call on your name.
