Plus, when me met the US, the exchange rate bucked. Got the dollar getting eager. And the solar light bill, it would a cheaper. But a JPS, you prefer keep ya. Ebenezer. So you scoot from the ghetto people. Where ya starving every year, buy a better vehicle The things you do are beatry bad But still you manage to keep your jobs And me I tell you, well done, well done Miss a politician, man You done a wonderful job at teardown
