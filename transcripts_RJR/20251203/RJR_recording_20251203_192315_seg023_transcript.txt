My manager, Dr. Love, popularly known. So after I found him in 2021 and we started working together, that's the first song that we produced. Funny enough, he had sent me the beat a few months prior to when it came out. And the song song I wrote it was I did it I did it on a Chris Brown beat actually that I found on YouTube so I wrote it for that and you know he sent me this reggae beat and I said I wonder if I can Transpose this song to fit this reggae beat, and it came out beautifully you know So that was the first the first record I ever put out professionally and then you know it was just full speed ahead from there I made a song for my mom called Superwoman
