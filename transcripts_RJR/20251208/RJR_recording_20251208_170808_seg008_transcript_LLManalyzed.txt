friday after two weeks of involved the ministries o and the J. P. S. This w 300 linesmen from oversea by next week. Working thr we hope that we will move 90% within that time fri and by end of January, we'll have full restoration, save and accept for some areas that are inaccessible. So this will also allow for the 170 linesmen that are currently in Jamaica, who would have been demobilized this week to also be retained in Jamaica, making the number 470 linesmen. So that is what the $150 million loan would be able to do in relation to bringing back the timelines for restoration for the island by January and by 90% December. And of course, their original timelines based on their projections and their cash flows would have taken us to May
