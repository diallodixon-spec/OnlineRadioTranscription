20251212 205848 Never too much. Thank you for sharing those wise words with us, Mrs. Omiyeli Jones. I would want to call you an IT educator. An IT advocate and helping us to break down the terms and to understand them because outside of the classroom, inside the classroom, every day as we interact with each other, we do need technology. We do use these data communication devices and network. I want to say thank you so much, Mrs. Jones, for coming on to share with us last week and this week. And who knows, we'll coordinate for the exam time. But we'll see. And to all of our listeners, our viewers, I also want to acknowledge those persons in the YouTube chat. I see you are you are also learning as well and interacting with the terms, the intranet, the extranet. So their learning are Mrs. Jones.
