You know, early in the piece, you know, I said to myself, you know, well, it's all right. Send the soldiers somewhere else because there are so many communities that are badly in need of the kind of assistance that the JDF will provide. I said, but no, that would be upholding slackness. It can't work like that, Mr. Sinclair. There is no right to dictate nothing until the Prime Minister, because he is the Prime Minister of the country. He is not a chief. A colonel. I mean, it's semantics in my views. The colonel, if he's a chief, not a problem. He was duly elected. But I'm just saying that leadership in these times needs to take the who made the decision that he wrote to the Prime Minister. What is it that motivated them to make that statement?
