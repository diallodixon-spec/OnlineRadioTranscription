So earlier this year, there was a very long mention list, and the parish court judge was presiding, decided that as many matters as possible should go to mediation. So first up were two men, two long time friends, case and cross case. Both were charged with assault, occasioning actual bodily harm. The judge asked them if they wanted to go to mediation and explained the process to them and when said judge, you know this this incident happened at a bar where we were both drunk and You know after we made our reports and after we sobered up we decided that we don't want to go any further But the judge suggested that they still go to mediation
