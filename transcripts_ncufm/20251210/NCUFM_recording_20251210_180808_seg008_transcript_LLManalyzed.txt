You are stolen out to Jesus. Let me hear you say yes. Hear you say yes. Big banger coach can't take the place of Jesus in my heart. In my heart, in my heart. No big degree can take the place in my heart. Oh no, oh no, oh no There is a hell that's to gain And a hell to shun There is a right way to live And there is a wrong So let nothing take the place of Jesus In your heart Oh no, oh no, oh no Redeem when my burnout's in the sky Redeem when my soul can damn to die Redeem for the price I could not pay
