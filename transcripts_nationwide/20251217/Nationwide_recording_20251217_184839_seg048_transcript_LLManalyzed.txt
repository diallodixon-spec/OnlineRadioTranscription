20251217 184839 I want to talk about the science that tells you that it is so, that it is as it is, and it is no hoax. One name comes to mind. Professor Michael Taylor, who is co-chair of the climate studies group, who have been gathering data and have been running models on the data for so long that the information now stands scrutiny and allows us to be able to take decisions. Science meeting policy is what we want to expose ourselves to. I hope that Michael is going to share tidbits of the many things that we have discussed that he has shared in the faculty that he has shared online. The most recent of course is attribution studies that he introduced us to where with his colleagues he's been able to determine so what this hurricane have been as bad as it is or was without human influence, without greenhouse gases, without what we've seen around us. There are no studies that can actually quantify and tell us that the problem is real.
