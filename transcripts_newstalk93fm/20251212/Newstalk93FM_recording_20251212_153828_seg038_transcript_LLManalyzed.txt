20251212 153828 If I could get in, drive me a pen Hop in the coupe and come over Don't wanna be friends just in the skin I wanna get closer and closer and closer The way you got me all in my head I think I'm better than you in my bed Whatever it is, you know I can take it Counting the days, how many days till I can see you again And you got me all, you got me all in my head, you got me in my head all the time. She's got me all, oh, you got me on in my head, yeah, every time.
