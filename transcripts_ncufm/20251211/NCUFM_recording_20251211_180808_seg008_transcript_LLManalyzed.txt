2025-12-12 11:04:10 end of the drive and I'm enjoying the music. Auntie Sharon's still locked in so she can't wait to see Tajela and Vespers tomorrow evening. Alright, blessings Sister Phillips and Sister Marcia. No problem Trisha and Smelly Bran, everybody getting them linked for Vespers tomorrow. See y'all! Let your power fall. Let your voice be heard. Come and change our hearts. As we stand on your word. We stand on your proven faith.
