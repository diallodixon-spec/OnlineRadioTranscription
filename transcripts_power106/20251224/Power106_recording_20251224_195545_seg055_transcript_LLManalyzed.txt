I'm currently the producer of this show, David Thomas, The Technical Man. We won't be here tomorrow or Friday for that matter. We'll be back on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday again of next week. Would you like to take this opportunity to wish you all the best for you and yours over the Christmas season and hope 2026 will be a better year for you no matter what the achievements were in 2025. For those of you on the roads, stop scaring the daylight out of us who understand how to drive. Please, we ought not to be having hundreds of fatal traffic accidents in an island that host less than three million people. It is bizarre when I see the police doing everything they can to ensure that those numbers go down. Congratulations to all the members of the Jamaica Constabulary in force.
