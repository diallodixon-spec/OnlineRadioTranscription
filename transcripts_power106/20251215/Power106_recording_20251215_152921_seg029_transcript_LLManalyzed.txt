20251215 152921 Why in heaven's name are we building up these massive structures? And most of them we can't maintain because you're going to some of these houses or you look at them after a time and they run down, you know, the morass on the walls. You know, you're coming and especially speaking to a lot of my relatives who are returning from England and America. Build a three-bedroom bungalow because we know that when we reach a certain age the start hurting us. And we can't go up the step. Don't compete with Mr. Jones. When you look at the world, Mr. Jones doesn't have anything to do with it. Not because he built bank to bank means we need to stop competing with people who have no impact on how we live day to day. And put down our money to go to a doctor and stop building these massive mansions that before we look around we can't occupy them. You know, live, build according to your position because half of what's every building is for the grandchildren and children who are born in England who are not coming back out here and when they come to Jamaica they are going all inclusive. Build a three bedroom, they come to stay where they let them.
