If you come from a downtown, give him praise and if you come from out of town, give him praise with all of your might, just give him praise. He's worthy, so much worthy. I start my praises early As I wake in the mornings I've learned to appreciate you Lord Want everyone to be in one accord Spread your love and share your grace Put on everyone a smiling face There is none like you So merciful and true I thank you Lord, and every single day Keep praising the morning time Sing praising the evening time
