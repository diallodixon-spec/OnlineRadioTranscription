The police say about five this morning they conducted a targeted operation in White River in search of Brown. He was reportedly cornered in a one-bedroom house and shot. The police say they seized a semi-automatic pistol loaded with 13 rounds from the suspect in the commerce probing the incident. 186 people have been feted a shot during reported confrontations with the police since the start of the year. Now there's a chicken box outbreak at the Hunts Bay Police Station in St. Andrew. The disclosure was made on Monday by Director of Public Prosecutions Claudette Thompson during a hearing in the Home Circuit Court. Thompson did not give details about the number of cases, but confirmed that the outbreak prevented murder accused Lennox Williams, who is being held at the station, from appearing in court. As a result, the matter has been postponed until April 13 next year. That is the latest news on Radio Jamaica. And Adrienne Gordon, good evening. News on Radio Jamaica. Stay in the know.
