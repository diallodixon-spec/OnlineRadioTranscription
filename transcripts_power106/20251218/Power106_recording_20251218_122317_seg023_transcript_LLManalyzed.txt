20251218 122317 The Agriculture Minister was speaking at a press conference held in St. Catherine on Wednesday. The National Irrigation Commission, NIC, is now accepting applications from farmers in St. Elizabeth to connect to the new Essex Valley irrigation system. NIC Director of Commercial Operations, Wayne Barrett, says the system will become operational in 2026 and the team at the agency is starting the recruitment process early to ensure that after completion, customers can begin to access the irrigated water without delay. Mr. Barrett is encouraging farmers to visit the new forest office and speak directly with the NIC to the existing New Forest Office, which is close by the Essex Valley area, and we have necessary representatives here to interface with these applicants and to allow them to complete the application that is subject to the required document. And it's ongoing.
