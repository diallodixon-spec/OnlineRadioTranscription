20251222 164823 Merry Christmas. It's the time of year when everywhere you hear the sounds of Christmas cheer filling the air. It's a holiday that should be every day. It's time to celebrate and show we care. Things are not the way they used to be. We need to stop and remind ourselves what Christmas really means. Remember Santa Claus. Remember all the toys. Because this time of year is for the children. Go and spread the joy.
