Robin Williams has the details. The JPS boss Hugh Grant is reporting that more than 96% of customers in St. Mary and Portland have been reconnected, joining Kingston and St. Andrew, St. Catherine and St. Thomas as parishes that are almost fully restored. He noted that remaining outages in those areas are mainly due to access challenges or issues specific to individual properties. JPS has also surpassed its 75 per cent restoration goal for Clarendon, Manchester and St Anne, telecommunication sites, town centers and key economic zones to help jumpstart national recovery. He highlights major progress in western Jamaica, the area hardest hit by the hurricane.
