20251225 095526 When I can't stand you Must everything you do Make me want to smile Can I not like you for a while? No, but you won't let me Do you upset me, girl? And then you kiss my lips All of a sudden I forget That I was upset I can't remember what you did. But I hate it. You know exactly what to do so that I can't stay mad at you for too long. That's wrong. But I hate. You know exactly how to touch so that I don't want to fuss and fight no more. Said I despise that I adore you. And I hate how much I love you more. I can't stand how much I need you. I need you.
