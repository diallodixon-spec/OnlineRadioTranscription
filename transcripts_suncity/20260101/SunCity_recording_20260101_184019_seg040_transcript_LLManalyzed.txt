20260101 184019 No offense my bro, no disrespect. Big up to all Rastafarians. They don't know nothing but love and positivity. I kind of feel like a Rasta myself. I try to live like a Rasta because Rasta teaches. Cleanse-ness, which is next to godliness. Positivity. Love, unity, strength. Why you wouldn't want to support messages like that. So big up to the Rastafarian community straight every time. Badrass, big up yourself. Be safe on the ground, my bro. A lot of accidents are happening. Yeah, man, everybody on the road right now listening to sun city just take on a time slow down because remember you know potholes just appear every day you know sometimes you're driving and you're like yo what a pothole just appear out of nowhere so yeah so just go easy
