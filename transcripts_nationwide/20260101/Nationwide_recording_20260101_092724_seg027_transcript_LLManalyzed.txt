20260101 092724 You and me, girl Gotta hurry to the sky We can turn away from the night and day And the tears we had to cry You're my love I can see you're new to us Everything we own, we'll never die Love is such a beautiful thing When you want to me Never wrong to say, my precious love Nobody gets too much heaven, never mind It's so much harder to come back, I'm waiting in line
