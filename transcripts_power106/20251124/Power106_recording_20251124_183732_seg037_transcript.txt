the feed in some cases. We want as much persons to participate. You know the yearling sale, the number of horses has been decreasing over the years and that's something that we want as much local breeders to participate in. So we are looking as a collective group to offer as much incentive for those persons to have their horses enter in the sale. Well, this is, we have moved from a yearly sale to a mixed sale. Let me tell you about the number of entries. Can you throw any light on that number? Well, the number was 76. We're still open, we're still accepting our entries. So if you have folks out there who want their horses to be involved in the sale, we're still accepting entrants. I think the lead fees have been waived because we want as much participants as possible.
