20251217 120606 We ain't going nowhere, we ain't going nowhere. Like we ain't leaving this place. We ain't goin' nowhere, we not leaving this place. We ain't going nowhere. We not leaving this place. Hey, anybody fix? Tell them fly over. We jamming all on the shoulder. Y'all listening, moving closer. Send your bumper right over. Then drop it lower. Then walk it slower. Watch me in your review mirror. Go, go, go. Y'all you are the greatest. You always be my favorite No matter where we face it Don't worry at all We go in places On all the biggest stages We on the road to greatness, girl In one, two, three, hey I don't need no traffic jam
