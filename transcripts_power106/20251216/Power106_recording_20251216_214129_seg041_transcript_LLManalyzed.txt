20251216 214129 I go to the bank to open an account in the pandemic, as they call it, the hurricane pandemic. You don't hear no government talk about the Rasta community. They've got a maroon town and they don't say nothing about the Rasta communities. The two most indigenous groups of people in Jamaica. Where it now come here for the prime minister and parliamentarians. Most of them come here through rasta, the music, the food, and the culture. Yeah? So we've got to open this account, even though I want a little account there. The people, let me say, we have to go get job letter, receipt, and J.P. has to sign recommendation. And I say, have an account, I just want a different one, a new one.
