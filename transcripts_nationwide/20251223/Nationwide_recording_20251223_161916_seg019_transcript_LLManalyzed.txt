20251223 161916 So speaking of TikTok, right? So it is a thing and obviously it is here to stay. And a lot of people, I do think that, you know, sometimes look down on TikTokers. But it is a job, technically. Who said job job? I mean, it couldn't be a side hustle. So what I want to know is, how did TikTok fundamentally kind of change your lives compared to what you guys were doing before? For me, I just changed. I've been very open about it. I was struggling before I started TikTok. TikTok can really improve your life because it doesn't matter where you come from, what you do, how much money you have. You can really make a name for yourself app, right? It's up to you to determine what type of name you want to build for yourself and that's where the part where you say people look down on TikTok comes from. I don't think it only has to do with the gifting, it's just because of the behavior of some white people.
