20260101 201009 I'm amazed at the price I chose to pay And to think I ignored what really mattered Cause I thought the sacrifice would be too great When I finally reached the point of giving in I found the cross was calling even then Even though it took dying to survive I never felt so much alive. For I am crucified with Christ, and yet I live. Not I, but Christ, I live.
