Gotta prove it to myself that I'm on top of shit. And you would never know a god without the goddesses. Honest is fucking honest kid. And I could be on everything. I mean, I could be the leader head of all the states. I could smile and jiggle and tell it's pockets empty. I could be the CEO just like Robin Fenty. And I'mma be there for you cause you on my team, girl. Don't ever think you ain't had these dreams, girl. They want to pit us against each other when we succeed. And for no reason, they want to see us end up like we Regina or me, girl. Princess or queen, tomboy or king. You've heard a lot you've never seen. Mother of Mother Mary rise to the top. Divine feminine, I'm feminine. Let me be your woman. I can be your woman.
