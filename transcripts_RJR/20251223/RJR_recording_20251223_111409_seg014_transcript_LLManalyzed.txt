20251223 111409 Alright, well we do have an interview lined up very shortly. Yes, alright, great. There is a delay in him hearing me from this end, so the lines need to be sorted out. And you did hear, especially in the West, for instance, a challenge there as well. But this is the aftermath, but we'll soldier on until everything is up and at a particular juncture where we can handle them. All right, so what we'll do, we'll take a break now. Of course, it's into the hot time, but back to the very shortly, an interview that is lined up. And of course, I want you to listen in. We'll take a break. Jamaica's spirit and resilience shine brighter than ever.
