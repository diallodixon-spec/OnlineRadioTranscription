20251212 185332 tomorrow and at worst a draw but I think they can probably scrape this. I don't expect a lot of goals in this match. So Burnley, to get the better of Fulham, I think Burnley may just about keep a clean sheet here. One or two goals should be good enough from the home side. It might be difficult for them, Jeff. I'm doing here now? Yes, I'm here and I'm saying it might be difficult for Burnley. They haven't won in a while. Burnley are struggling. So it may not be that easy. They're at the bottom of the table. They have won. They've lost the last six games. So it may be that straightforward for them against the Fulham team that have shown signs. I don't think that will be straightforward for Burnet to actually win because the confidence is pretty low in the team right now. So I think that the visitors, Fulham, will believe that they can get at them and actually get something from the game. All right, let's see how quickly we can go back. I want to aware that you were on.
