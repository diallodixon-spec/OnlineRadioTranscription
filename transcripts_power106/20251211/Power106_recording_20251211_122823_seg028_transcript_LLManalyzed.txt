U.S. dollar donation to your Office of Disaster Preparedness, which was sent by wire transfer a week ago. I've also made a series of statements in public and on social media asking my supporters to do everything in their power to help the people of Jamaica with donations of any kind. I'm ready to work with you to help in any other way I can. My thoughts and prayers are with you, with warmest regards. Culture Minister Olivia Grange was giving a report on the island's fundraising efforts under the I Love Jamaica series, which are ongoing.
