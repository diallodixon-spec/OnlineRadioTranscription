20251225 135024 All I want for Christmas is you. Ooh, ooh, ooh, baby. Oh, the lights are shining so brightly everywhere. Oh, baby. And I saw the children's laughter fill the air. Oh, oh, oh. And everyone is singing. Oh, yeah. I can't help but stand here waiting. I said, won't you wait? Oh I just want to see my baby everywhere outside my door. Oh, I just want you for my own. Oh, if you could ever know. Make my wish come true. Oh, baby, all I want for Christmas is you.
