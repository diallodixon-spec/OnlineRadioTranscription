20251215 215133 You got me singing love songs Love songs, love songs yeah that make you fall in love song that hate me at what you want make you hit me up song And if we paint a perfect picture we can make it last forever And you're the only one I want to wear my orange sweater I told you I am down for the worse or the better But I keep sticking to you cause I'm forced to feel down as well
