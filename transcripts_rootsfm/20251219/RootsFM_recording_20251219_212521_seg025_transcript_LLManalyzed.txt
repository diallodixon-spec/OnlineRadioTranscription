20251219 212521 It was plain to see that a small town boy like me just wasn't your cup of tea. I was wishful thinking. I gave you my heart, and I tried to make you happy. And you gave me nothing in return You know it ain't so hard to say Would you please just go away I've thrown away the blues. I'm tired of being used. I want everyone to know I'm looking for a good time. Good time.
