============================================================

I don't know what is happening here, you know. So I would love to see something start for the people. Like I said, the Matalan poor houses them was slab roof and in the time they done it, they were in the garden. It used to be like one bed room where you finish it off yourself and all them sort of thing. So we don't want no delay, no choppy choppy. Millions and millions coming in and much more to come, you know. So I'm only hoping. You know, I'm going back on a post-servation thing. They gave some good lucky money the other day.
