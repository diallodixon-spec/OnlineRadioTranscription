Cancer affects so many lives, but knowledge is power. Join us for Cancer and Me on the Hello Jamaica show. This feature is dedicated to educating and empowering Jamaicans at home and abroad. Each week, we will dive into vital topics, risk factors, treatment options, mental health support, and inspiring survivor stories, bringing you expert insights and real life experiences. Tune in every Monday at 9.15 a.m. for Cancer and Me on the Hello Jamaica show, because awareness saves lives. I will greet this day with love in my heart, for this is the greatest secret of success in our adventures.
