20251219 174638 Welcome back, welcome back Nationwide at Five and we're in our cover story looking at the incident that took place at Rocky Point in Clarendon. Last evening three persons murdered in a family by a family member and before the break we were hearing from Councillor Marage about what he had heard on the ground about the young man who we are told is the person who seems to be responsible for the killings. And now we want to bring in our consultant psychiatrist, Dr. Jeffrey Walcott, to help us work through what we can see and look at for the mental health conditions that may affect person. Dr. Walcott, in general terms, can you help us to understand what happens when a person experiences a very severe mental health crisis? What do we look for? What are the signs? Okay, so I don't know if you're speaking specifically to an individual or the community because there are changes that are happening
