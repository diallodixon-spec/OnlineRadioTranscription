20260102 130806 if you a couple of them even a couple feet and they have it down to inside I think probably 10 feet or so if you are a couple feet before before when the lights are yellow then it's supposed to stop some of these people they don't stop even when it's green even when it's red they don't stop and go through still and they can kill you so you know this camera will take your like of place show you how to rent your license plate, and they send a ticket in the mail. Nothing I think will save lives also. Now, I was thinking with the speeding camera, I was thinking that if we could, I don't know if it's out there, leave a, to police things a drone to find a monitor and then give you a ticket with a drone. So in other words, you don't see nothing, but they monitor a certain roadway and from a certain distance and then send a ticket in the mail for you.
