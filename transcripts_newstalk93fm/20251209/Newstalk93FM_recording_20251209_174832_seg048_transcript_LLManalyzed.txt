Falling I might be falling. I might be falling I might be falling I've been drinking more, for the past five days Did you check on me? Now did you look for me? I walked in the room, eyes are red and I don't smoke banga Did you check on, did you check on me? Now did you notice me? Nobody will know the paranoia Cause I put a smile on my face A facade you can never face And if you don't know me well, well, well
