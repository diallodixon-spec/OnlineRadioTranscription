20260101 212416 I just know what I'm feeling And it's all because of me Don't tell me, I don't know, I want the truth Cause they call it me, call it you, call it life, call it love We have a mom that's a breaker And it's not time to let it go Gotta change my answer and machine Now that I'm alone Oh But it's the only way I hear your voice anymore It's ridiculous It's been months For some reason I just can't get over it And I'm stronger than this Enough is enough I'm walking out with my head down I'm so lonely
