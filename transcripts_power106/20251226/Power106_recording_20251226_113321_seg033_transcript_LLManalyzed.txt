20251226 113321 Yeah, I really need you near me tonight Cause you'll never take me there again Let me watch you go with the sun in my eyes We've seen how love can grow, now we'll see how it dies If I've got to be strong, don't you know I need to have tonight When you're gone, till you go, I need to hold you Until the dream to hold And we could touch back the world We don't have too much There's no tomorrow here There's only love and the time to face it So we had yesterday Yesterday's gone, my love There's only now and it's time to face it
