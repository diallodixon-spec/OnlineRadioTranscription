20251231 111012 how it will impact our exports. What we see happening on the global stage is worrying, but most of our discussion seems to be around domestic issues as if we are operating in a bubble. That's the point I've always been making. So one of the things that we have to do is diversifying our trading partners. So we only do 6% of our imports from Caricom, we only do 10% of our exports to Caricom. There's Latin America, there's South America, there's Asia, there's Africa. We have to diversify our trading partners but we have to start producing something first because if you don't have nothing to sell, you can't trade. So we have to start back production because production is now very low and that is why the Bank of Jamaica has to be so active in the market. They'll be taking out another $29.5 billion today because output has fallen significantly.
