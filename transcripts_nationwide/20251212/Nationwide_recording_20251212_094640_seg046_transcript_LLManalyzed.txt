2025-12-12 09:55:43 I have 162 public schools under my supervision. I cater primarily to supporting the daily operations of the schools. And so I work with a team of education officers, building officers, school feeding unit, our guidance and counseling unit, et cetera. So it's specific to the operations of school, providing the necessary supervision to ensure, for example, the quality of education that is provided to the students is of the highest standard. And so you would be critical, then, in the assessment across Manchester and St. Elizabeth in the aftermath of Hurricane Melissa. Yes. What has that been like? What's the scale of the damage across the two parishes? Well, as I said, we have 162 park schools, and of these, 121 were affected by the hurricane. 58 of these were severely impacted, mainly in St. Elizabeth, because as you know, St. Elizabeth is the brunt of the hurricane in this region.
