20251217 140406 Crawford says he is returned with nothing else left to prove after announcing the end of his boxing career at the age of 38. The American exits the sport with a flawless professional record of 42 wins and no defeats, including 31 knockouts. Crawford's final bout came in September, when he defeated Saul Canelo Alvarez to become the first male boxer in the modern era to hold undisputed titles in three different weight divisions. That historic victory capped a remarkable career that began in 2008, when Crawford made his professional debut with a win over Bryan Cummins. Over the years, he collected world titles at Lightweight, Light-Welterweight, Welterweight, Light-Middleweight, and Super-Middle-weight. The Omaha native said his final achievement against Alvarez confirmed his legacy, allowing him to step away from the ring as one of the sport's all-time greats.
