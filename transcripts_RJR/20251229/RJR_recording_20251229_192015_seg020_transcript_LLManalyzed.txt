20251229 192015 the noisiest place in the world is Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh. And we wanted to get a sample of that sound, so we sent journalist Salman Saeed to meet lots of people in the city and give us a sense of how noisy it is in Dhaka. You ready for it? Oh yes, sure. Okay, here we go. What type of noise do you hear? That moment you don't necessarily have in Dhaka at all, yeah, in any time of the day. Perhaps like if you wake up at 3am in the morning you might have, but even then Dhaka seems to be sometimes awake at that time. That's Ramana Khan. She's lived in the same neighbourhood of Dhaka for nearly 30 years.
