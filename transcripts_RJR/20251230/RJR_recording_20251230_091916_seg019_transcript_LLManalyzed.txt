20251230 091916 Welcome back. And before I give you the numbers to call, I have to give you the updated number. And thank you, DT. I had 368 deaths so far this year on the roads. It's now 373 deaths compared to 365 deaths during last year, 2024. And that's one number I didn't really want to give you. I prefer to give you telephone numbers than road traffic deaths. But we are indeed the architects of our own destruction. The numbers to call are 876 9 is 8 8 8 9 9 1 2 0 8 0 and the whatsapp for your messages is 8 7 6 5 5 3
