20251229 150508 They don't want me cause I do one way They don't want in there proceeding I ain't gonna listen nothing to say Every fast I jump, jumping up Doing what I want, jumping up Tell them I ain't leaving Right they are sleeping Every fast I jump Jumping up Doing what they want Jumping up Tell them are you living? Right there sleeping. They don't want me, they don't want me. Until my head's gone and I'm miserable. All the money grown, I'm causing trouble. Look how the security watch me. They don't know I'm out there. I'll just smash up the place and I'll like a jumbie. I don't wait. They don't want me in their party there. That's the kind of room they don't want me because I do. One way. One way. I don't listen to nothing they say.
