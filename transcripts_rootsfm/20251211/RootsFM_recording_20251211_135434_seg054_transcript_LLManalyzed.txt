2025-12-11 17:14:20 Out of a million, you stand as one, you're standing one. I look into your eyes, girl, what I see is paradise. You captivated my soul. Now every day I want you more. Now I cannot deny this feeling I'm feeling inside No one can take your place You cannot take your space It's a fact I cannot erase You are the one that makes me smile Make me float like a boat upon a night Girl, you are my African queen The girl of dreams. You take me where I've never been. You make my heart go ting-a-ling-a-ling, yeah.
