Well, we're going to get into that, Madam Estate Administration Executive, but the reality is that you have set the tone for us, and I want what you said at the beginning, just to sink in to the psyche of the listeners. Yes. That because you don't leave a will, you die without leaving a will, you couldn't bother to to leave the will or you thought that making a will would mean that you would die not realizing that whether you made the will or not you're still going to die and the reality is the law now steps in and say all right here I am I am going to distribute it for you your estate that you spent your life on. I am going to say who gets what, and it's not a matter of your wishes anymore, but my wishes as the law. And so I'm glad you set that tone for us.
