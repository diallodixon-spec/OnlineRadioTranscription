20251212 140709 Stir-fry. Stir-fry. I got my things and I got my wings and I fly every day, got a lot of wings. Everybody sing. Happiness. We're not here to make a wish. Money for your friends, money for your bad minds. We don't want no friendship from them. Sing again now. Happiness. We are not here to make wishes. Dance for your dance and I enjoy myself. If you want, sell out for your business.
