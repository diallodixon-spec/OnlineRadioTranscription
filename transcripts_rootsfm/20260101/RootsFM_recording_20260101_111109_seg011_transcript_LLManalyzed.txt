20260101 111109 Hold me tight, girl, we got all night. Let me make love to you. Just let me make a love to you. I tell you, you reach over and hold me tight. I'll reach over and turn it on you like banana. In the middle of the night, like sun. Till broad day will come up Ooh, honey, it's all right Stay right here and sleep, honey, let's do it Together Together Now, honey, I need encouragement If you want this high And kissing and touching will turn you on Let's be together
