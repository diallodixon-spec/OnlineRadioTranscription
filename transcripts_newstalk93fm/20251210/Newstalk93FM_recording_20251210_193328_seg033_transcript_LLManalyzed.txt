============================================================

Fire, fire, fire, dash them with holy water. We life look better than ever. All them times they go fail to try again Bad might never prevail All them try they go fail Cause pure hearts we don't fret And we don't run away from Once we have faith we strength Could cross by, I guess, with you. From your way.
