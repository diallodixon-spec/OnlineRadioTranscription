20251218 161512 I try to hide these tears coming from my eyes It's all because of you I'm feeling sad and blue I'm sitting sitting here so confused. My mind is stuck on you. I'm not afraid to say I'm missing you. Over and over. Yesterday we were in love. Today we are no longer together. Leaving me wondering what could have gone so wrong you know i love you girl you are my everything you are my everything
