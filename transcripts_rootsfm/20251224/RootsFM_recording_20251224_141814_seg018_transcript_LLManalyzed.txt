20251224 141814 fight we would finally get it right we would live in a hell of a life but love had a different side we had it yeah we lost it gang get back to where we started damn it always feels like rain and it'll never be the oh Holidays are supposed to bring us closer But now I realize with you and me there's no hope I lost my love on Christmas night A gift that heart and the same time Bout to be a new year, a new state of mind But it's like hell right now Cause you're not around
