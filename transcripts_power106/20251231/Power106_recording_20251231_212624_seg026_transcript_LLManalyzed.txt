20251231 212624 I'm falling in love again, tell me see Ben Ben A long time I know you, remember when you grow you And when you get small, no man never want you But now you get big, don't forget my Russia But don't mess with them cause all they wanna do Is use you, abuse you, and then they refuse you But all I wanna do is just take care of you, tell me, never falling in love again Take me sweet baby Take me away, take me sweet baby Gotta be a better way Gotta find a better way Pocket is empty, no money to buy And God knows I'm hungry, don't ask me why
