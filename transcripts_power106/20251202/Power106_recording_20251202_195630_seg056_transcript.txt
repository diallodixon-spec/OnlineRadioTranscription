============================================================

I'd have to see the sequence of the goals in this fight for one day to catch it. We're as busy elsewhere in Newcastle. And Spurs shared four goals. But let's see what's happening here. Tomorrow at 2.30, it's Bernie versus Christian Pauley. Palace, World States, nothing, and Arsenal as well. Again, Brentford Leeds versus Chelsea. And that's tomorrow. But on Thursday, Liverpool will play tomorrow, but on Thursday Manchester United will take on West Ham to complete round number 14. So that's your little primarily round up. My name is Cliff Williams. Floyd Wright is the producer producer of this show. Damien Thomas was our technical man at sea.
