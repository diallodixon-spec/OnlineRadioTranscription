Yeah, the entries are strong. We're over 1,200 athletes in the meet, and they represent about 52 teams. And this should be very exciting for both male and female at the high school level. And we'll also have an increasing number of student athletes in the primary division. So the primary division, interestingly, is developing where some of these coaches have the athletes in training and they're ready to run in December. Of course, we know the primary chances in May, April, May, so they're in preparation for that major championships.
