20251222 182313 I'm making my way over to my favorite place. I gotta get my body moving, shake the stress away. I wasn't looking for nobody when you looked my way. Possible candidate, yeah. Who knew that you'd be up in here looking like you do? You make staying over here impossible. Baby, I'mma say your aura is incredible If you don't have to go, though Do you know what you started? I just came here to party But now we're rocking down the dance floor at tonighty Your hands around my waist
