============================================================

The more you try to fight judge your life is shining too So I've got no time for you Cause in my view you wanna step in I'ma show you we should never leave a loo and feel so damn confused How every day you wake you ache because you know you fake And every step you take I bring you closer to your grave What I am like a column when I easily shake Me certain say I fit me none of who no can't take We guided by the monster, defender of the fight. Yes, all them to be great. Oh, they're my bad biters Supercritical two-sided loss We call them modern day juicers Spreaders of rumours But your teeth and tongue gonna let you down Reward for your show
