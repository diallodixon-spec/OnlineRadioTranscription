20251225 194529 There's the Johnsons. Let's see how they're doing. No, no, no, no. Let's go. Why? Are we doing something this afternoon? I just want to hear a sermon and go home. If we hang around here too long, then somebody might ask us to do something. Is that so bad? I don't want to spend all day at church. I came, I listened, I sang. Now come on, let's go. Dear, we are part of this body of believers. We should be doing something. Can't we be a part of the body, but not a functioning part of the body? You mean like dandruff? Yeah, no. Look, I just want to ask John if he found a job yet. John's out of work? Yeah, the last four months. He told me at the men's breakfast last week. How's Sarah taking it? I'm not sure. Oh, I should talk to her. I thought we just wanted to go home. How can you think of bolting out of here when people need to be encouraged? I didn't. Sometimes you just don't think. Me? Oh, shush.
