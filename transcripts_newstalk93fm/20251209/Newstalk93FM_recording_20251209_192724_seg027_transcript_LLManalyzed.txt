Daylight come and we don't wanna go home Yeah, so we losing control You're listening to Sleek Radio, 93 FM. Hey, hey, hey, hey. That's my soul, that's my soul. When my dreams drop and wake, I must go now, must go now. When the stars in my life passing out, seize the flood. The last thing on my mind is going home. From the window, from the window. In a while, in a while, this girl is jumping in, she's jumping in.
