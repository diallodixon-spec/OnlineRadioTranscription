20260102 192520 Just one kiss stops the rain from the skies The tears from my eyes from falling down my face Rolling down my cheeks, baby From rolling down my cheeks Can't you see it, baby, yeah I love you and if I live forever I will be loving you still. And you will always be just here from right to me. So hurry back and bring the sun. Let me be yours.
