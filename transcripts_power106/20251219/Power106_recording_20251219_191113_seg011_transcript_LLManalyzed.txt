20251219 191113 We shall see how that one pans out in a little while. All right, so coming up shortly, we'll be the second of our three musical selections to be followed by your Did You Know feature. We'll talk horse racing for half an hour to take us up to our sports update at 7.45. And then your quote of the day will be followed by another great piece of Christmas music, the Roger Wagner Rad. Is it the group or the band or the ensemble to be featured next with an extraordinary arrangement. No question about it. When you hear it, you won't believe that this outstanding piece of Christmas music could be arranged in this manner. Joy to the world!
