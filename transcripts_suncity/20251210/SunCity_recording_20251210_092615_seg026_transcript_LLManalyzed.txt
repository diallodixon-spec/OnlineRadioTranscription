to be delivered. So, we have to pray for them. Even if you have a dispute with someone, pray for them. The Bible says, we love your enemies. Do good to them that hate you and pray for them that despitefully use you and you're saying to me now, how can I pray for people who's coming against me? Imagine this. When we were sinners, Jesus went to the cross for each and every one of us so that we can be delivered and be able to go and be presented to God. So if he could do that for us, then we must become a sacrifice over the situation in order for God to intervene and make a difference, make a change for a soul to be saved and also for you to be delivered from your situation. So don't just look at your situation and say it's doom and gloom. Walk in the light as is in the light, and we are fellowshiped one with another. And the blood of Jesus Christ, God's Son, will cleanse you from all sin. So we must just look to Him and see how He works. So this enemy Dave is talking about, yes, he's going through that.
