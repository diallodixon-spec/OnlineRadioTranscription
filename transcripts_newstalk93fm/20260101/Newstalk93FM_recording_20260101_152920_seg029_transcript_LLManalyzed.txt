20260101 152920 I see the prayer, I see the prayer All my ego now for you All my rabba now for you We'll go home now for you All the motto for my car now for you. All the best for you. I put my life on the line for you. Nobody else but you. Baby, baby, baby boo. Shake it. You don't say you made my boo. If I believe you, baby, I be boo.
