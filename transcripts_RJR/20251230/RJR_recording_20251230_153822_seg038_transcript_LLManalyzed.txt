Well to be honest it was a frustration in the industry like me did there in, because you know Jamaica is like everybody black so like when things happen you know really pre-set I become a black white man. Right, right. Or something else. Or something else like the security who badmined me also black. Right. You know what I mean? It's something else, it comes more than just being black. Whereas when we got England it's's like me, I tried breaking out of the film industry and I made a good film and I just feel like nothing ever there happened. It's then me really start pre that, oh, I become a black, white when I rate my thing, or white when I not give me a chance. And me just decided to say, yo, actually me want to talk about that in a way, because me feel like nobody about it like why nobody talks about this thing that I guess in film nobody never talks about it but I understand why because a friend of mine said to me yo it would take somebody like you to make Dreaming Was Black and I wonder why you said that?
