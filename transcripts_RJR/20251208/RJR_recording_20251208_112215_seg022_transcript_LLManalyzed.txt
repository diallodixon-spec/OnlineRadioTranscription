The late fee, $2.50 on it. That is rubbing salt in the wound. I mean, even if later on they're going to reconcile that, but for it to come in any instance, it's really salt in the wound, and so for me, I can't do several of them, but the thing is computerized. You have to make the adjustments. At least advise the consumer. So I fully appreciate that. Their adjustment, Mr. Mullins, is to disconnect the water but that's what they do and that's the thing because if you don't supply the commodity I don't understand it you cannot have a pipe without water for a month and a half and you are still billing people. What's that about? Yes, yes. As I said, that's pouring the salt in the wound. What's that all about?
