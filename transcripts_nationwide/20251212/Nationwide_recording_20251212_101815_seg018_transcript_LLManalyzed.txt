Yes, I took him to a private doctor, but I haven't gotten the scan done as yet. And is that a consequence of cost, not being able to afford it? I'd say yes. Because when I did a research and he said that the scan is $45 000 and i'm a farmer i lost everything everything from my home everything from my farming everything yeah so if you are listening or watching and you can assist uh in ensuring that this scan is done it's very important yeah so that we can be sure uh that the seven-year-old is okay we're gonna ask you to contact broadcast house uh to let us know if you can assist uh so that we can be sure that the seven-year-old is okay. We're going to ask you to contact Broadcast House to let us know if you can assist, so that we can give Annali some assistance there. In terms of rebuilding now, you said that the structure collapsed. Yes, sir. What's that like now?
