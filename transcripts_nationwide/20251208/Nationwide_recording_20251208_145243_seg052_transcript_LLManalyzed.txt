I'll step up in life. I'll remember those days. Life comes up all the time. Mummy, open the door, please. I know you're crying in the bathroom One day we a go rough everything we need Safe for me heart soon But when me open the door please no The loving of me heart see you can't move One day we ago rough everything we need safe for me heart soon
