There are persons who maybe you had a neighbor who you were not so close to and after the hurricane, believe me, you were checking on that neighbor to ensure that everybody's okay. If you're the stronger person, then psychologically you would have given some of your colleagues a little talk, you know, embrace them. The students, the same thing, because, you know, they're all suffering psychologically. and I would really want to say thanks to all our partner schools and other entities who have really stepped up we were able to distribute care packages to all members of staff students we also have clothes that were distributed to them for some persons had lost And so we are really, really grateful for all of those entities who have contributed to making us feel like we are alive again. All right, I'm going to leave it there unless there's anything quick IW would have to say.
