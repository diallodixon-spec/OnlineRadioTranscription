20251231 171914 I would like to start off with things like tires and so on. So to ensure that we are using a good grade and good quality tire. A tire that is made for the purpose that the car is intended for. And also a good quality tire. And I'm going to say this. I was using a budget tire. And I realized using a budget tire, there are a lot more weights going on to the tire to get it balanced. And even then, it still wouldn't balance properly. And I went back to the other brand tire that I used to use, which was not really a budget tire. But lo and behold, the weights, Shelley, it was a fraction of what the budget tire used. So instead of using two ounces of weights, I used like a quarter ounce of weights to get the tire balanced. That is the difference between using a budget wheel, a budget tire, and a more expensive tire.
