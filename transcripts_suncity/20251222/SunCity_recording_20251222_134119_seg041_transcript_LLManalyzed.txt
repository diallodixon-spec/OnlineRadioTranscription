I don't want to see you with a carriage, livin' average. I wanna do my thing so we be established. And I don't want you rockin' the parish. Girl, I wanna give you carriage till you feel you a rabbit. Anything in your path, once you get half. Walk through the mall, if you like it, you can grab. Total it all up, you put it on a year. Tell me what you want from me. Take a look at what you see see Let me know if it's right here This love is a guy that thinks he's smart Also known as a bust out Oh, it's so hot! Where's my umbrella?
