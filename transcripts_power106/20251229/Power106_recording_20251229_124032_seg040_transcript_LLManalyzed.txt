20251229 124032 Kalisha, Kyle, Leanna and Josiah husband Neville. We pray that you have a marvelous day and a long healthy and joyful life ahead and then it closes on a sad note that says unbelievable mom Sonia Byrd's mom that's their grandmother. 91st birthday was on December 27th and sadly she passed away on her 91st birthday. May I suggest humbly that after 91 years my father died at 84 going into 85 and he told me this and I've listened to quite a few people. What they ask of you is to rejoice, is to celebrate the lovely life they had. So don't cry too much.
