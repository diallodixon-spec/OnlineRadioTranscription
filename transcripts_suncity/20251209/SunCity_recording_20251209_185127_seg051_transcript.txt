Gorgeous! So we pray for the sun to come out Please send us down The breadbasket crying Farmers are born But we still get by Westmoreland flood River take the lame block River hospital can't ease the pain You see all the patch there Strong like steel Tourists them lock in a hotel meal The food done them start Fight for the breadcard But God you'd depp on life, a lafa We rise again We rise again
