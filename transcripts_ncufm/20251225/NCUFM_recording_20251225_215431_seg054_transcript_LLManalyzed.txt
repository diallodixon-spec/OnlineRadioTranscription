20251225 215431 Good night Jamaica. I am pastor Donald Valentine. And tonight, as we enter the night season, as the night watches upon us, we continue to give God thanks for His mercies, His goodness, and His grace. The pen of inspiration says, when every other voice is hushed, and in quietness we wait before Him, the silence of the soul makes more distinct the voice of God. Listener, the Bible teaches that the end of all things is at hand. It is a time of judgment and salvation, a time to fear God and to give glory to him. And in this your personal moment of reflection and control.
