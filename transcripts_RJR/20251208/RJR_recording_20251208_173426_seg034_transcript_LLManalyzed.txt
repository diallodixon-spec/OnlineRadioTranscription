Network continuity, so utilizing microwave and satellite starlink technology to provide temporary connectivity. And then obviously there's the restoration of fibre to the sites, which brings us back to LTE connectivity, which what people would have been used to prior to hurricanes. So on the mobile network, they're the main buckets, as well as any restoration of sites. So as I said at the start, we would have done assessments. So some sites will be damaged and they'll need to be repaired also as well. So you've got a huge machine on the mobile network alone that's working in tandem, keeping the fuel on, keeping the connectivity on and then restoring them back to where they were pre-hurricane Melissa. So hopefully that gives you a flavor of the mobile network and how we run the machine to get us back to where we were prior to the hurricane hitting us. Yes, indeed. So that gives us an overview
