============================================================

of you, Lord. For your mercy never fails me. All my days I've been held in your hand. From the moment that I wake up until I lay my head, oh, I will sing of the goodness of God. Because all my life you have been faithful. And all my life, you have been so, so good With every breath that I am able Oh, I will sing of the goodness of God
