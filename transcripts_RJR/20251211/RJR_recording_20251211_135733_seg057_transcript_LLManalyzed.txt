Hey, hey, hey. Kingston, be wild. Kingston, free up your mind. Kingston, just be wild. Kingston. When the city I go click-clack blow your bed government fingers and tick tock holes in it While they're working on the X's and hoes I'm living eye-to-eye like a Mr. Kamosi No surprise when they send info to me Opposite or when plain clothes approaching me Follow the rules is what they propose to me Selling their souls for what is old, you see Nothing is old, nothing is promised
