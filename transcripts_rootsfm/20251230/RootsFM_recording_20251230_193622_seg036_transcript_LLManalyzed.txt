Open his mouth, then he dancing my cha-cha. I swear I'm addicted to blue cheese, I gotta skip to this paper like my sweet talking about my chicken like it's a two-piece You can have your back to they shootin', I'ma say cause they broke wrist. Swag now, I'm never be bringin' them cats out, I still got some racks stuck in the trap house, off the 42, I'm blowin' my back door, I'm f***in' out, whole s***, I'm back with the full clip, they said I'ma be real broke less, I'ma soothe, they shootin' it, I'ma say, cause they broke wrist, they shootin'.
