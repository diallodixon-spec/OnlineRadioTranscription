20251231 165536 I never trouble you You come trouble me You think I was all alone But I'm in God's army And if you trouble God's children You've got to pay the price Watch the giant in your life fall down Trouble soul you must pray Night, trust God, He'll make our way. No test, no testimony, no cross, no crown If God be for us, we will be victorious Watch the giant in your life fall down No test, no testimony
