20251231 090103 Baby, no way We could post up all the pictures you want When you're ready I could overhear, darling You could overhear But we could meet in the middle and start a bacchanal Play in the middle, hey What we gon' do now? Jam to a rhythm in the heat I can't eval, I'm in the heat, hey What we go do now? Start a wine on it I say compromise on it Baby, spend time on it, hey I say compromise on me, spend time on it I say compromise on me Can we talk some business You know I want your company And it's nothing too risky Limited liability Don't worry If you try all the things I like You could still be shy in the morning So don't feel away You don't like the fast life But look on the bright side, girl I go take the blame I just want you to come and light it up Just a little right now
