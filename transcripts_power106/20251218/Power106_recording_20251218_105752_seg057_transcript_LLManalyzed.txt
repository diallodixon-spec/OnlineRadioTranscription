20251218 105752 on board. Today we have a partnership with Hus with assisting some of our livestock farmers. We had one in Elders yesterday that they are assisting some farmer with fertilizer feed and fertilizer seeds and chemicals and that's as important as farmers. When I went up there to tell you we have resilience of farmers, we saw a farmer coming out with at least a thousand pound of ginger going out to the market. What you say? So already, now talk to us a bit about the spirit of the farmers then. I mean, getting that gut punch by Melissa, what's the morale like? What's the energy of the farmers here now? Most of these farmers are really picking back up the pieces and what they're asking for is just small assistance and someone's goat there before and we have other agencies coming in to assist them as possible. Right. And events like these will go a long way, I imagine, to help our farmers in this side of Jamaica, especially in the Breadbasket Parish. Yes, that is true.
