20251216 143522 Oh my lord, you sent your son to save us Oh my lord, your very self you gave us Oh my lord that sin may not enslave us and love may reign once more Oh my lord, when in the crypt they found it Oh my lord, a golden halo crowned it Oh my lord they gathered all around him to see him at the door. Oh my lord, they had begun to doubt you, oh my lord. What did they know about you? Oh my lord, but they were lost without you, they needed you so bad. Oh my lord, with the trans-adoration, oh my lord, near him, great tribulation, oh my lord.
