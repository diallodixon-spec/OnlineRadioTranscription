20251215 201309 Feeling the soul taking over Telling me to start up the drinking And do away with good behaviour So we out on the road now BOOM! It's Mars and Riddy Man Soaker And I'm ready for the rum Ready ready for the rum, ready ready for the rum ready for the action BOOM! The sweating spirit of me feeling good. I have a lightning spirit. Early in the morning I at it. Me cooler ready. Me ice done ready. Me punching that's automatic. I have a lining jumbie. A kind of energy inside me. And it ready for the rum, ready, ready for the rum. Ready, ready, ready, ready.
