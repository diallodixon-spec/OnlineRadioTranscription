I can't even walk sometimes if I don't make it fast or wake up myself to the bathroom because it's time I'll carry it down far to my body, you know. Yes, yes, I understand that. But you sound so good. You're in good spirit. Well, my daughter just say mama make nice people who say I'm not sick, but God is good, you know, he saved me. God is good. Because I went through it, a car hit me down, run over me, leave me on the street side. I spent two years in wheelchair. I'm still on going. Yes. With God's grace. God's grace and mercy. Still going. You go to church? Yes. I'm a Seventh-day Adventist. I go to church. I go in Seventh-Day Adventist Church. Yes. Yes. All of my kids, kids are there, and myself. We fight it through, because no matter how the road is rough, God is there to carry us safely through. So you still go to the church now? Not now, because... Yes, you can't walk so well.
