It goes beyond food items and donated relief supplies. Future projects will include rebuilding homes and schools with support partners. We do have a number of persons who are, of course, reaching out to us to offer their skills and their services to volunteer. They want to actually see how they can go into Jamaica to support the effort of what's going on there as well. So we're starting to, of course, redirect persons through to the OdEM volunteer sites where they are doing that. But we are also starting to look at the projects that we could take on board because alongside our individuals in the community, we do have some of our partners and agencies and such that are here that want to see how they can create projects that will actually go to help with the rebuilding and recovery effort that's taking place. Persons in Canada who are interested in donating items to Hurricane Melissa relief and recovery in Jamaica may visit the High Commission's website for a list of drop-off locations in the North American country.
