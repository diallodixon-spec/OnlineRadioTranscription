20251223 120506 Cultural Commodities Regulatory Authority, JAKRA. The handover on December 17 to farmers at JAKRA's headquarters in Kingston formed part of a 120 million contribution by the government and the regulatory body for targeted intervention to address one of the most immediate needs in the recovery process, including nutrient restoration and productivity support at the farm level. But while expressing appreciation for the donation, Mr. Sammons says farmers need cash in their hands. We are seeking grant funding for farmers, right? And the government has given us assistance with fertilizer and such. While it is a very good gesture, but it is not enough. We need more assistance in terms of that. How have you managed up until this point without the necessary propping up, the necessary showing up, the necessary support? So we do a lot of different things.
