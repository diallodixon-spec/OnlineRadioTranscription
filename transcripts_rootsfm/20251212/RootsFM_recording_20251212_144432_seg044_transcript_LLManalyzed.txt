20251212 144432 Some day at Christmas men won't be boys Playing with bombs like kids play with toys One warm December our hearts will see A world where men are free Some day at Christmas there'll be no wars When we have learned what Christmas is for When we have found what life's really worth There'll be peace on earth Someday all our dreams will come to me Some day in the world what men are free Maybe not in time for you and me But some day at Christmastime
