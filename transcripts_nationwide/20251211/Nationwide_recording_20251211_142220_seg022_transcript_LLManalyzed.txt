I'm getting Mr. Right, the man of my dreams Wanna show me true love, or at least it seems We're brown, cool, cool skin And curly, light hair It's just the way he looks at me That gentle love stare Finally, you come along The way I feel about you It just can't be wrong If you only knew The way I feel about you I just can't describe it Oh, no, no Finally it's happened to me Right in front of my face My feelings can't describe it Finally it has happened to me
