20251215 131911 I say believe people miss this, and mind your own. I say, believe people miss this. Leave people misses alone. Leave people busy and mind your own Leave people busy and alone Leave people busy, and mind your own You in my way Like a rolling stone Like thick and stone Cannot break your bones But they be killin' all your odds With a sling and a stone. Samson killed a philistine with a donkey job on. So leave people's business alone. Leave people's business and mind your own.
