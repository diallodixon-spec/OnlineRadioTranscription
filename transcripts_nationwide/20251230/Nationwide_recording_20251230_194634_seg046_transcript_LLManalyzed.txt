20251230 194634 inside out oh darling I wanna be so deep that you'll be needing me inside I want it so deep that you believe me When you're lying in her bed and you're in her arms instead of mine, love As you feel her tightening grip, oh, Cagini, I will sing in your heart. I won't give up, won't give up. Won't give up, don't give up. Don't give up, give up. I like the notes here in this song.
