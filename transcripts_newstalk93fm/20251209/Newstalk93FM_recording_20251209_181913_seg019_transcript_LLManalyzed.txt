============================================================

up a wall but you ain't bulletproof I done got it out the mud and got nothing to prove Tryna open up your mind and see a clear of you All the times I made you wait for me, no But I was on the other side and didn't notice I won't waste my time but it comes to you Put my love, baby? Why can't you come on and let us play? When are you going to come my way? What sort of things they've been telling you? I I got to stop them from compelling you, girl. They just won't stop me from getting you. Give me a try, baby.
