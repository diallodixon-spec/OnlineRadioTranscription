20251215 154421 Oh, are you just having fun? This is Rewind London. 104.9 FM, Sun City Radio. Radio Man of Difference. Can't sleep at night. I toss and turn. Listening for the telephone telephone But when I get your call I'm all choked up Can't believe you called my home And as a matter of fact It goes by like You wouldn't even talk to me Because a girl like you is like a dream come true A real life fantasy No matter what your friends try to tell you, we will make them fall in love. And we will be together, any kind of ever. Just like that, just like that. And the girl next to every white wonder. You will be there in a little step by the way. We'll be together.
