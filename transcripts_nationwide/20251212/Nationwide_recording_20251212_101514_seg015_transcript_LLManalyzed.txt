2025-12-12 10:30:17 we were basically outside now when the when that structure collapsed and the zinc sort of like closed the door on us because of the strength of the wind yes it closed the door and us and at the time the concrete that collapsed was on top of my seven-year-old's head yes it collapsed in his head is he okay? is he? Yes, I'd say he's okay. I want to take him to do a scan, but yes, he's okay otherwise. So at the time, I tried pulling the door, it wouldn't open. And I decided I have to take the other five inside. So when the wind calmed down, I pulled the door and I took took them inside but then the other one wasn't responding at all so the 7 year old I went inside I had my one year old baby in my hand I went and put them down safely and safely mean that
