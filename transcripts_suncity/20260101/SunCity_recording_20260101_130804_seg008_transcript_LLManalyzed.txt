20260101 130804 is in front of Bob the Builder, right against the rail, that's Sonny T and Chippy out wide, Kem trying to come on, also coming on, that's Wayne's Princess, but it's Whiskey keeping them at bay, coming to the furlong pole, Whiskey begins to come away from them, it's Whiskey in front, Bob the Builder trying to get to Whiskey, Whiskey in front and Whiskey stretching this lead, coming to the Furlong Pole, Whiskey pulling off, Whiskey and the champion drop, Radish Roman getting the second, Whiskey beats Bob the new year with a nice exact. Well, an accurate exact. I don't know if it's going to pay that much because whiskey was the the second choice in the betting. But Bob the Builder ran off at 11 to 1. That should be OK. Whiskey, and you look at the book. He ran the fastest time last time. And everybody ran 122 and change. Whiskey came out of a different race and ran a faster race.
