Well, I tell you what, let me ask you a couple of questions about what you've been saying. First of all, how come you entered the competition? Whose idea was it? It was my mother's idea. All right. Miss McNeil, tell us why. OK, sure. So we had the discussion. I saw the post being made and I approached her. Of course, she would have been doing other activities, including spelling bee at her school at the time. She was in the midst of the JCDC festival, so finals that is. So I approached her, would you want to enter this competition? Brianna, she said her response was, I'll think about it. So thereafter, she came and she and she said mommy I will enter the competition that you asked me about and that was how you know she got involved with the minimus Saint Thomas Heritage Queen competition. All right so Brianna what did you do to get ready for the competition?
