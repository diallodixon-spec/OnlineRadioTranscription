============================================================

I wanna be your love Like a saving grace, you've opened up my eyes I don't know what I would do without you in my life. The perfect time and situation are two parts called life. Love me, baby, with everything inside. Never forget the way you looked when you turned to me. The day that we met. I can't express in words how you make me feel Never forget The sound of your voice When you said to me I wanna be your love
