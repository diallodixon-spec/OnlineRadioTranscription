I used to love it when we were young You always said I'd be your number one and your hits won't break You'd buy me down as an expensive wine Out on the job we always had at the time of the day of my day. Move on, you can't get back, you're afraid, you're not what I knew Move out! Move out! Cause I don't love you more I try to warn you more But you are nothing but a toy Move out Move out! Play the game before Oh, I've got to move on Oh, I got to move on
