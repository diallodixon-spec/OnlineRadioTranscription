============================================================

Wind up in the van, free up, live your life, and do whatever you like. Mashing up in with DNA, winding up in with DNA. When we on the roadway, we like we on the way. Tell them freedom in with DNA. We go jump till the moon come down As we whistler shine on Play amaz and break away Freedom and we decay You're listening to Sleek Radio, 93 FM.
