I'm a bring in the sauce can't trust people. No they're wearing a mask. People like the pump price, nothing to cost. They use them loss to stop crime, that is a task. Whether it's raining or it's sunny, you better have your money. Then you face them all go down in life shorter than a trolley. And the breeze and the rain, but it gets so deep. I don't clean them dirty and, and muddy. Lion and thief, them are self-ent. Won't get them all clean with detergent. Try to make you walk in, cause it's urgent. Urgent. Urgent. Send them your faffies, they go purging. Cause it hurts when you're friendly.
