20251224 131911 I'm in love with you I'm your knight in shining armor Whenever I'm with you I I feel so delighted, overjoyed. The little things you do give me feelings just like no other. Forever I'll be by your side. Together we can fly and soar above the highest health. If all goes well, there will be no forgiveness, if all goes well. We will be fine in the realms of God's blessings we're all folks dwell and while we walk this aisle together holding hands beautiful church bells they say that love is blind now your eyes revealing secrets your heart won't tell
