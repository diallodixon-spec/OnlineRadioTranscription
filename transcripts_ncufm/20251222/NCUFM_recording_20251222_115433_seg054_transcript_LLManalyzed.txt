20251222 115433 has settled in for this because living fully represents grateful for what you have already provided. Let your heart be anchored in gratitude so that even when circumstances change, our joy remains steady in you. Father, we lift up those who struggle with dissatisfaction, anxiety, or feelings of lack. Surround them with your peace. Remind them that you are their shepherd and that in you they shall not want. May your spirit guide them to see the richness of life, beyond material things, the richness of a love of community, of faith, and of hope. Lord, may we echo the words of Paul, I have learned to be content with all circumstances. Strengthen us to trust you in every situation. May contentment be your testimony, showing the world that our joy does not depend on what we have, but on who we belong to. We thank you for the gift
