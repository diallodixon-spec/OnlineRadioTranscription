20251215 134741 You are hot like summer, warm my heart. I don't need no other. I love spending time with you like the sunlight. You see me through. It's a holiday when we love this way. And we're just getting started. Cause this, this is a fact. Our love is like summer time. Healing my mind. Our love is Like summer time. Ooh, it feels so cool to me. This is a fact, our love Is like summer time. Fireflies lighting our way as we walk walk Words floating in the summer breeze when we talk What we have is endless Take away all my stress It's so familiar and still so brand new
