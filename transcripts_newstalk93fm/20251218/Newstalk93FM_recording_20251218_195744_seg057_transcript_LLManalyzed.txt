20251218 195744 O my life, I'll do you. Breathe and take my breath away. At your altar, I will pray. You're the sculptor, I'm the clay. Oh, my, my, you're taking me out of the ordinary. I want you laying me down till we're dead and buried. On the edge of your night, staying drunk on your vibe. The angels up in the clouds are jealous no one can bow. So listen, I'm ordinary. You got me kissing the ground. I'm a sanctuary. Share with me what you've done. Oh Lord, return me to dust. The angels up in the clouds are jealous, know what we've found. Something so heavenly, higher than air.
