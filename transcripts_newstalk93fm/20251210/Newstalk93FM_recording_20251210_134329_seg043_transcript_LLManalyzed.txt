We like phantom, phantom If I tell you say I love you You know they from Yangau, oh wear yellow Every other girl did they do too much but this girl mellow Now you might find situation I could use they tell I'm mellow Finally I find way to talk to the girl but she no ain't no one follow. Who you going to phone for? Why you no one come for? Then I start to feel a bum bum bum. But she didn't give me small small one. I know, she said she's happy, but sit down one one. But she feeling insecure. Cause her friends go there got my lighting gone. Go there got my lighting.
