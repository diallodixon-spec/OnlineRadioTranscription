20251217 182618 in the top 10% at least of the grade, academically. Most times without books, and with the worst attendance. I'm not sure how that happened. Even coming from ULS, a lot of the times I had fear to come in one direction to get to school, and I had no idea how I was gonna reach back home in the evenings. So sometimes I had to walk all the way out to the roundabout in Martin Bay and then try to take a ride to get back to Yellows. And those days, of course, I would not have any lunch. And sometimes I had fear both ways, but I had no lunch money. So, you know, a significant amount of the days I really never had anything to end the lunch at school school. When I got the fifth form and it was time to pay for the exams, I also didn't have any money to pay for the exam. And the school at that time made a decision to pay for six subjects.
