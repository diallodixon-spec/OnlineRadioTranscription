20251224 121917 partner. International, after two years of subdued Christmas celebrations due to war in Gaza, thousands of people have flocked to Bethlehem's manger square on Christmas Eve. The BBC and Associated Press are reporting that the giant Christmas tree, which was absent during the Israel-Hamas war, returned on Wednesday. It replaces a nativity scene of baby Jesus, surrounded by rubble and barbed wire in homage to the situation in Gaza. The top Catholic leader in the Holy Land kicked off the celebrations during the traditional procession from Jerusalem to Bethlehem, calling for a Christmas full of light. Despite the holiday chair, the impact of the war in the Israeli-occupied West Bank is acute, especially in Bethlehem, where around 80 percent of the Muslim-majority city's residents depend upon tourism-related businesses.
