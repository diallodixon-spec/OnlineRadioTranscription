2025-12-12 12:39:03 Just call my name You want to get wet Just call my name All out on the road Just call my name In case you forget now They call me the party animal We jammin' straight till mornin' There's only me them callin' They call me the queen of Babkanal There's only non-stop walkin' Just hear the people shoutin' Just call my name, just call my name Love how you move your body Come, come, shawty, walk it for me I'm just standing, nothing to say, cause we'll make them look so good like them pictures Lift and you drop it for me Oh, la, mama, pit-a-pit-a. So you on the road, you're standing. The rhythm, your waves are like tune-in-in, because ay, ay, ay. I'm a skeptic, just like a waste, mama, before I die. Just give me witness, I can't nobody do this. Ay, ay, ay, I do all of them who watch it.
