20251229 171509 I know that you are with me, so I can't. I can't give up now, because I've come too far from where I started. Somebody told me, oh, no, that this road won't be. But hey, I don't believe, don't believe it. It's brought me this far to leave me now. Said I can't give up now. I can't, I can't. I can't give it up now. Cause I've come too far, too far.
