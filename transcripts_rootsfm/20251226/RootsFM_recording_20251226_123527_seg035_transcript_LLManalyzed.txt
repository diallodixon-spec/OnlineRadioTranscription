20251226 123527 I don't need a reason or a season to spend time with my friends I don't need sleigh bell sounds or papergrounds to go back home again There's 51 whole other weeks where everyone's still here Forgive me if I'm not the guy you call for Christmas cheer There's no magic in the lights and snow No love under the mistletoe No joy for me in going broke
