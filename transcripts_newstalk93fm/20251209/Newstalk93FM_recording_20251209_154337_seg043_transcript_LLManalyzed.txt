============================================================

It's your time, baby. It's your time. That's the difference when you're my baby. That's how it is when you want action Until the lights back on I got the one we could last long And I'll never move my tongue Feel like what I waited for lifelong I pull up in my high fashion Every night that shit in any way We can go ahead and just head out And fill up in my villa. I take it out the whole night. Just get in the drop top, take the head out and cruise with your head outside. Go ahead, it's your time, baby. It's your time baby. Get by, baby. That's the difference when you're my baby.
