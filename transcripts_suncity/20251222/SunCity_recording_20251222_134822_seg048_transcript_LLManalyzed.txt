20251222 134822 every time i come around you see every time i buy a new ride check it out get you with no delay into what you saying yo still be with your with your ice, really with the dilly-o. When I be on the mic, it's I do my duty, yo. Wild up in the club like we wild in the studio. You don't wanna find me, baby, really and truly. I'm a mean thug, villainy, Julio. He moody, yo. Like a brother that has slapped it with a Tulio. Real shook, scared to death. Ex that, buddy, she a little cutie-o. The way she shake it make me... Brutio. Top men stressin' the bangin' misses in videos. Round up with my flick like we're lippin' the freak shows. Did you... feel it all in your toes? Hatch. People and wrecks. Tellin' my metaphors and... my flows, if you don't know.
