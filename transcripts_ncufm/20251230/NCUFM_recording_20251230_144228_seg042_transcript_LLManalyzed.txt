20251230 144228 Teach us how to speak truth in love and how to encourage growth in others as you encourage growth in us this afternoon. I want to thank you for this family, this drive time family. Bless everybody who is listening. There are prayers that individuals have been praying for 2025 and as we look forward to 2026 there are still some things that aren't in but Lord, I'm asking you to bless us. Bless us beyond our wildest imaginations. Outdo our prayers, our limited prayers, knowing that what you have, your will for us, is greater than we can even imagine. Thank you, Father, for your love and your grace. Thank you for this family. But at the end of days, please hope that we all can get as a family, be a part of the family of God, and be ready to hail you as our personal saviour from sin, meeting you in the air in
