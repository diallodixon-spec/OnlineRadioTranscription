I can feel Him, He's been on the inside So come and enter in, and cast your cares on Him He'll open up up a winner when poor you're out of last faith. The life of the lost does him, he brings everything you need. He is power and victory, so it's all up to you, whatever you need him to do. Just trust him and believe, and then by faith you will return.
