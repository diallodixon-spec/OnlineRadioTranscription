20251226 104237 So if I took it for granted You're not promised from today I go jump like I never jump Waved like I never waved Pined like I never wanted to Just to show you I'm sorry, I'm sorry And I need you back in my life Look at people by the truck Emotions running high We're up in the sky Tears running down we're high Can't you tell that we're sorry? We're sorry And we need you back in we lie I need a gun back home Come home to me, come home to me Come home to me First time I touch this thing This make me feel alive
