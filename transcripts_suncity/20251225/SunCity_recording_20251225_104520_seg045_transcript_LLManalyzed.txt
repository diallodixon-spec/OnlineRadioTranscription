20251225 104520 baby I can't wait for late December. Smell of cinnamon and pine. We'll be picking out the Christmas timbers and hanging up the fairy lights. We can have a party, you can sing the carols. We're not going out at all. I got everything I need right here. There's no one else I need to call. Cause there's no, no place like home in Christmas time. Let the snow fall down. We're startled up inside.
