2025-12-12 11:57:08 people here in our country. Absolutely. Yeah, man. It's one of my favorite islands. But listen, thank you for your solidarity. All the best to you. Yeah. I'm just asking Jamaicans to keep hope. I'm keeping the breath. You know, some people might not like people and some people don't like that. I love your Prime Minister. I love him. Okay. So, all the best to you and God bless Jamaica. Thank you for that, Gail. Thank you for your call. Bye-bye. And all the best for the season. Somebody's just messaging me. Boy, that Bajan accent, they love it. You're lucky because sometimes when you hear two Bajans speaking, you can't make head or tail of what they say, but I guess they would say the same of us if they came down to St. Elizabeth and heard us talking some proper Patra, like me name go down there. All right, so let me get back to, I believe we have Jigsaw, Jigsaw, morning. Good morning, sir, season greetings.
