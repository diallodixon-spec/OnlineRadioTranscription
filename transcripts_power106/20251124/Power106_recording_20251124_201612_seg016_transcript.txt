============================================================

I do close by saying these things in the name of Jesus Christ, whom we represent. Amen. You're listening to Power 106 FM. The time is now 8.15. Thank you, President Pino for the authentic message on Light the World. And with that authentic message, we now need a testimonial of past Light the World events that we have had over the years. So no call on President MacPherson and he's representing the mission of Jamaica. President MacPherson, thank you. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Last year, in the lighter work activities, we had a team coming from the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, along with the Red Cross.
