So be sure to look out for the team from the Ministry as they carry out cleanup activities and so we should not ignore our signs and symptoms and seek medical care early. Community participation in cleanup and rodent control is essential but we have to ensure that we are using the appropriate personal protective equipment such as our appropriate gloves and water boots. We need to make sure that we are protecting our children and the elderly and persons with chronic illnesses as they are more vulnerable to severe disease. And we also need to make sure we are reducing the debris pile and high vegetation which is harbourage for rodents.
