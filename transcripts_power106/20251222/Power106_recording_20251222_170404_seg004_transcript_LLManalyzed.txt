20251222 170404 These include St. Andrew South 74, St. Catherine North 63, St. Anne 60, St. James 52, and St. Catherine South 50. Also of note, 17 of the 19 divisions recorded a reduction in murders year on year. Only St. Thomas and St. Anne are showing year on year increases in homicides. Data from the JCF also show that most major crime categories are down. Murders, shootings, cases of injured persons and reported incidents of rape have all recorded decreases year on year. However, the crime update indicates that robberies and break-ins remain areas of concern as these are the only major crime categories showing 8 and 19 percent increases respectively for the period under review. Police sources note that these offenses continue to impact residential communities and commercial areas, particularly during the traditionally busy holiday season.
