I put the family first, for better, for worse. Ooh, Jah Jah bless, let no man curse. I'll put the family first. Though sometimes it hurts hurts So glad we're together here on earth, well Mess up me uncle Never know you was a lion in the jungle You're looking looking so wise and humble. Never forget your advice and counsel. Mark one, Stacey. Love how you're taking care of your baby. That's just the way you always are and you're raising it. Look how long you're telling them not to go make it.
