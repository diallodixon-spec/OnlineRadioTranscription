Singing love songs we have once begun Before we drifted far apart Before I knew I lost my heart Never really said goodbye We never really said it's alright We never really said goodbye First love never dies When I saw you I could hardly speak You're just as beautiful as ever, babe I guess it's still the same mistake First love never dies And we'll never really say good-bye We'll never really start this over We'll never really say goodbye
