20260102 154720 I got a condo in Manhattan, baby girl what's happenin? You and your tinted body, so don't forget to clap it. Go pop it for a plan, pop, pop it for me. Turn around and drop it for a plan. Drop, drop it for me. I'll rent a beach house in Miami. Wake up with no jammies. Pops to tell for dinner. Julio, serve that scampi. You got it if you want it. Got, got it if you wanted. Said you got it if you wanna. Take my wallet, you deserve it all
