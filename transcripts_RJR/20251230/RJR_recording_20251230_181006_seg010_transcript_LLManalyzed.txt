20251230 181006 Patsy in Spanish Town says I want to remind Mr. Warmington that the church was one of and still is the first response group to our citizens affected by Melissa even while being affected themselves. I must also caution the churches if at all possible not to accept this grant from government. A few years ago it was rumored that the churches should start paying tax. I personally don't want my assembly to accept this grant. And she goes on to say condolences to the RJ Arglena group and Donald's family. It is a significant loss. Dwight in South Carolina says sincere condolences to Donald's family. I got acquainted with him when he was at CVM as a producer for the program football GPS. I was an active participant and used to win prizes on the program. So I'd have to speak with him to collect my prizes. I've been following his sporting journey since and I also have another listener saying I must say separation of church and state is of universal importance and ignoring the need to enforce the separation is likely to negatively impact minority religious groups.
