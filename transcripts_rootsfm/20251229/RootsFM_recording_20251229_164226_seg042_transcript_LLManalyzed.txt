20251229 164226 No matter what they say, true love will never die. My love don't go away. Sometimes she do me good, sometimes she do me bad. But so we've been together, a fight we never had before. And every time I talk to you, girl, I want you to correspond. But sooner or later, you're going to be my only woman. True love will never die. No matter what they say, true love will never die, my love don't go away.
