20251223 163121 I wish you come from me. London, I wish you'd come from me. New York, I wish I'd come from there. When you come in, my baby. I wish she'd come from here. Atlanta, she come from here. Toronto, she come from there. And I know that you miss me. I love the way that you bring a vibe. With your hands, them up in the sky. Falling down and having a time. Wine and season again. And we have the money to spend. And we jamming down to the end Runnin' with me Hannibal friend friend friend friend, yeah I'll make cannibal friend Until we meet up again Everything on site, you know The bag been packed, you know She dreamin' to take a ride on me Cause she comin' down to please When she ram a chair, she push it back all the way
