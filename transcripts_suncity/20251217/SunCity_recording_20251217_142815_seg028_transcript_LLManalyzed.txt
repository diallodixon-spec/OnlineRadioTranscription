20251217 142815 I was a one-night man on a one-night stand Never enough, never enough Tell it's a girl, not me no plans All I want was a one night stand Rippin' Ranaf as fast as I can No one to love nor no emotions Not the kind that I settle down So nobody to chat No one to try to change me operation But the girl is still a persist Right and now she just hard to resist She get harder and harder Hard to resist She ups me under pressure I was a one-night man on a one-night stand Never enough, never enough
