20251224 105031 I'm sure that the people at JPS will give a proper answer for that. You know, I have to say it, I'm not an advocate for the JPS or anything like that, you know, but let me tell you this, that team, you know, Audrey, Winsome, Ruthlyn, they never hitch, right? I've never, since I've been doing this at a marquee, I know them all from, well, certainly, Audrey and Ruthlyn, I know them long time, and I can tell you this, they have never lied to me. True, true. They said I'm gonna do something, them do it. Many times, them hear something, and them come to me and say, did you know about that? I might know. So, we'll pass this on, and hopefully we'll get the kind of answer that you will be satisfied with. Good morning, how are you?
