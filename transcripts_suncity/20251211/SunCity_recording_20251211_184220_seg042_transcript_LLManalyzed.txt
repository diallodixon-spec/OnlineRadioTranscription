2025-12-12 12:16:00 look so it's always talking about some disaster somewhere because my mother is this weather lady right so that's what she watches so everything relating to that content is what is fed to her so i say that to say this we have to become very intentional about training or algorithm what i what you what you want to see basically if you take my phone right now i can't tell you i'll be preaching you how to see messages, one or two cartoons, maybe little clips of Korean movies here and there. But those are things that I'm interested in, fitness and those things. But again, we have to train our algorithm. As it relates to how we manage that now, I put a timer on all my apps. After an hour, TikTok goes dark for me. I can't interact with it. After an hour Instagram goes dark for me, Facebook goes dark. The only thing I don't have a timer on is WhatsApp. Because I know WhatsApp is very much basically your phone.
