My husband is sitting here. Can I interview myself? I should interview myself, Mr. Flowers. What did you say, my husband? Nothing. Nothing. I wouldn't be so rude on air. I'll be private. Okay. Mr. Shields, thank you. Thank you so much for all the assistance. I declare interest. As you know, this is my husband, but he is the managing director of Shields Crime Security Consultant. This couldn't happen without him because he's part of the brain of everything. What do you want to say to the listeners, Mr. Shields? Well, I'd just like to say it's been a fantastic turnout today. I knew there would be a lot of people here.
