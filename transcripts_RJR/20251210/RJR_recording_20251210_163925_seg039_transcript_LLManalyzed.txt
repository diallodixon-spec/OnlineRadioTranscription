Someone who made me feel alive Baby when I met you there was peace unknown I set out to get you with a fine-tooth comb I was soft inside There was something going on You do something to me that I can't explain. Hold me closer and I feel no pain. Every beat of my heart. We got something goin' on. Tender love is fine. It requires a dedication All this love we feel Needs no conversation We're riding together Making love with each other
