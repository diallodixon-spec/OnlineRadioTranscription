I think you're making me crazy. Put my heart up on the main line. I got this trust for you. Got it because I know what you like. I love you. Good and bad, thick and thin, flaws and tool. And if you're ever in the wrong, I'll let you know. Yeah, I know that love is unpredictable, but I'm pretty damn sure that this is the kind of love that keeps me up all night this is what i want to do for the rest of my life this is something that can get every bit of my time this is what they call real love real love real love you saw my halo even on days when you should pay more later i'm stuck with you so tell me about it how'd you day go are you kissing on me
