We give you thanks for giving us hope. We give you thanks, Lord, for ending us, ending our week with cheer and glad tidings. It reminds us, O God, that no matter what our circumstances, no matter what we're going through, no matter what chilling details might be before us, there's always hope in Jesus. There's always a chance for a better day, a brighter morning. And even as sin would have had its consequences on our lives, causing pain and grief and suffering, there is still hope in the cross. There's hope in Jesus. There's hope for eternity. And so a nation now, Lord, a nation gives you thanks and gives you praises and gives you glory for the ways that you continue to inspire hope in us in jesus's name we pray amen
