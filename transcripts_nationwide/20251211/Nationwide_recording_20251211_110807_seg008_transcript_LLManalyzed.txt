============================================================

We got under the bridge now, turned from Bustamante Highway. We see one little girl in a blue uniform with one man. And we see the man that stopped the vehicle. He said, send me the picture of the little girl. He said, in a way, community group. When he sent me, I zoomed in. I said, babe, turn back. Turn back my place, if I see you. And he just spinned around on the road. And and when we drive back we couldn't see because he was walking fast and look we see him go up like we're heading to the stop light. So when we drive up to him now because the hairstyle is different from the picture so I zoomed in the picture so I just wanted to see the face. So when I drive up close to him and I went down the window and I looked, I said Jesus, I see another little girl. When the man reached to the window, I said oh I saw, so I tried to look because I don't know if he has a weapon or something on the window.
