Trust us. Against us. Be prepared in a table for me. Yes, my life is worth my living. My love, I shall be given. Oh, Father, I love you more than words can explain. Oh, God, Oh Yahweh I need you in every way. Oh Father I love you. Move and we will share the same. Oh Yahweh, I need you each and every day.
