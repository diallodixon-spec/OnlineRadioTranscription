The contest was played in a light-hearted atmosphere, with underarm serves, exaggerated shot making and plenty of laughter entertaining the crowd at the Coca-Cola Arena. Sabalenka even broke into dance during a time-out, as the pair leaned into the exhibition nature of the event. Kyrgyz, who has played sparingly over the past three years due to wrist and knee injuries, appeared relaxed, despite Sabalenka competing on a slightly smaller side of the court. The players were also limited to a single serve per point, in an effort to balance the matchup. After sealing the win on his third match point, Krigos and Sabalenka shared a warm embrace at the net, bringing an entertaining evening to a close.
