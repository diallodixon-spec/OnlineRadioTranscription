I need your love Why don't you give love on Christmas Day? Oh, every little child all sad to see has moved For your love will lead history Give love on Christmas Day No greater gift is there but love. But the world needs its love, cause the world needs your love. Give love, oh give love on Christmas Day. Someday at Christmas men won't be boys Playing with moms like kids play with toys One warm December our hearts will beat
