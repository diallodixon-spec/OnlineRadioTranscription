20251216 095243 you are a burden to these customer service reps and they give you attitude and they tell you all kind of things and all kind of lies 24 hours is the biggest one because it never happens within 24 hours but I don't know I don't know if if we need to, you know, give the OUR more teeth, more resources, what needs to be done. But I don't think what the OUR should be doing when it comes to these utility and telecoms providers. I don't think it is doing that. And I think more should be done to assess the customer service problem in Jamaica. It's a major problem and because we get by and things get done it's not really something that we look at but it's something we should. Final call for the morning.
