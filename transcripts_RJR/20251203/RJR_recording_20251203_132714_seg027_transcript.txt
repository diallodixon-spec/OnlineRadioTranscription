We are peace, we are war. We are love, we are hate. We are everything. Like, if Jamaica people dislike you, it never stops. Nothing you can do. They just don't like you.

I look like a person if I come with it. You know you're the one and only. Like when God tells me I don't see them. It's beautiful. Beautiful.
