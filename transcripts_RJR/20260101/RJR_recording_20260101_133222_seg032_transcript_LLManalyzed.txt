20260101 133222 Can't do without you. Yeah. Thank you. Thank you. I wondered if I could have battles in my head Times I felt lost and broken Felt like I couldn't make it through the day But I know God has spoken And He promised not to leave me So I'm standing here today saying How did I get here? I call it grace, grace, grace Grace brought me here If it wasn't for your grace
