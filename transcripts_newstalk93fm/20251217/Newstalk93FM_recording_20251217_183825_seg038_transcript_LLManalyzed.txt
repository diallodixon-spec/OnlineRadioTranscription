20251217 183825 I'm done hiding, now I'm shining Like I'm part of it Oh, our time, no fears, no lies As soon as we're part of it You know we're gonna be, gonna be golden We're gonna be gonna be Wanna be, wanna be glowing Like every nanonori You know that it's the sun time No crystallizes who we're making up for lost time
