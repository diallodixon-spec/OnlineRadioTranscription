20251222 120706 I ask of you today, God Almighty, that you continue to watch over 440. For today, 440 is under curfew. And the request on Sister Campbell's heart is that the people will look among themselves, Lord, God almighty, and stop the killing in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth. So I put 440 before you right now, right off Balcom Avenue, and I ask of you, Father, to send the love. Send the love, send the deliverance arrow. Show the arrow of the Lord deliverance right now up in 440 that the young man can know that with God all things are possible and they are made in this world for something good. Something good can happen out of them Father. So I ask of you today in the name of Jesus, raise them up. Raise them up to the Father.
