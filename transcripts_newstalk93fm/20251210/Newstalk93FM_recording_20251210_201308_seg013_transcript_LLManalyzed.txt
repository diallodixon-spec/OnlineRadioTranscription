============================================================

And I need you back in my life Look at people by the truck Emotions running high We are not in the sky Tears running down we eye Can't you tell that we sorry? We sorry And we need you back in we lie I need a gun back home Come home to me, come on to me. Come on to me, come on to me Come on to me I promise I won't cry First time I touch this dish This make me feel awake I want to touch this dish Promise I won't cry
