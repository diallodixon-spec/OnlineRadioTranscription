20251218 182518 Christmas was Christmas. It's like Christmas. What's that? The hope of Christmas is that we know as a Christian nation that there is a belief that there's a god and we still have life and so it's not really now about the festivity. It's really about our neighbors. The love that we maybe have lost. The hurricane really brought a lot of persons back together and so the season of Christmas will now enhance that kind of relationship that is supposed to be. Okay. Just highly commendable how much as a community we've come together to support each other. I think that to me is the greatest thing that has emerged from this. We're not giving up. We're not trying to find excuses as to why we're not doing certain things. We're pushing through.
