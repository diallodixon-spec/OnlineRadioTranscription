So it means that we have been able to look, to review, to adjust, and we are much, much more efficient. Of course, like in everything, you know, people want more and they want it now and that's understandable given the circumstances. So we continue to do our evaluation. What we have learned is that when it comes down to this kind of process, quantity doesn't always be quality. So having more assessors is not always the immediate solution. But you could have more and still get quality. Yes. They are not mutually exclusive. Which is the balance that we're moving to now. Because what we were looking at at first was more numbers.
