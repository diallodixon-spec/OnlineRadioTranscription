20251212 195044 I don't want the school to come out and say nothing in the public until they speak to the police and the police advises them as to what to say because I don't want nothing to jeopardize the case of my child getting the solution of that man going to prison. And I don't want anything to say to arm a lawyer for that lawyer to have something that the school said something and can go to court and use it against the case. I do agree with you and your position is isn't reasonable yeah your position isn't reasonable if in a matter like this the school has a responsibility to the public it serves, it's a private institution, but it serves the public, it offers its services to citizens of this country. It also has the responsibility to the parents and the student involved in this.
