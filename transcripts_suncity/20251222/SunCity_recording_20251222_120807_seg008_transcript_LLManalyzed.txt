The National Water Commission, NWC, will be trucking water to several communities across western Jamaica this week as restoration works continue following Hurricane Melissa. The agency says ongoing power supply problems, damaged pipelines, and mechanical challenges have disrupted normal water production and distribution. As a result, scheduled water trucking will take place in sections of Hanover, Westmoreland, St. Elizabeth, and St. James between December 22 and 27, with no trucking planned for Christmas Day, December 25. Communities to be served include Houghton Grove, Bethel Town, Darlingston, Magotty, Orange, Cambridge and others. The NWC is urging customers to be patient during the recovery process
