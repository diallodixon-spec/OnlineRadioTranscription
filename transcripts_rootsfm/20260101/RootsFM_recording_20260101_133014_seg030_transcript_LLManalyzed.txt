20260101 133014 Someday, it would all work out. Keep that faith, my heart would say. You've been right here, through it all, and suddenly complained to me. I truly can see there's no better woman than when it comes to loving me You give your all, tend to need one more Can I ask for a stay in my corner? I won't let this down, I need you right. Hold me close, never let me go. Stay, stay in my corner, stay.
