Now Puma officials, the Usain Bolt Foundation and another non-profit organization, World Vision, started distributing care packages at selected locations across the five parishes, worst affected by Hurricane Melissa. We've been working with Puma and the Usain Bolt foundation and we have 2,000 pairs of brand new shoes from Puma that they donated that we shipped over from the U.S. and so we've been partnering with Nugent and the Usain Bolt Foundation, and we identified five different communities, one in each parish that was hard hit. And we've done Christmas distributions there, and so we've set up where we're distributing toys to the kids, we're distributing backpacks and school supplies, We're also distributing Puma shoes. So it's been a real treat for all the kids to get the supplies that they need and to have a great Christmas. That's National Director of U.S. Programs with World Division.
