20251225 092012 Don't care about the presents Underneath the Christmas tree I just want you for my own More than you could ever know Make my wish come true All I want for Christmas is You I don't want a lot for Christmas. There is just one thing I need. And I don't care about the present. I only need the Christmas tree. I don't need to end my stocking. Live upon the fireplace. Santa Claus won't make it.
