Exactly.. So it's good and it's helpful, but there are challenges where that is concerned until we restore to full electricity. Yeah. And how's that restoration going in terms of your needs, your plans? Well, we've been doing, I think, well under the circumstances. So overall, our restoration is at about 84%. But most of that restoration is on the eastern side so we're talking about Clarendon, St. Catherine, Kingston and St. Andrews St. Thomas, Portland St. Mary St. Anne right so that's where we have like about 90% restoration.
