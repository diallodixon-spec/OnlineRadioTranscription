20251219 113624 Yesterday I hear she tired like no adjunct or after lady called me and said if you go for $60,000 down at the MP office, then the Prime Minister will give you $60,000. Why must it be the Prime Minister's office and collect it then, that might be easier. No, you behave yourself with the question. Who else must distribute it? Or it must be distributed? Oh, you mean like through the Ministry of Labour?
