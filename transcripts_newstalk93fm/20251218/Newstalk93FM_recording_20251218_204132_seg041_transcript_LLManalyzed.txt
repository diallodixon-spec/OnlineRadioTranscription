20251218 204132 Oh my my, oh my my love I take one look at you, you're taking me out of the ordinary I want you laying me down, to the dead and buried On the edge of your knife, staying drunk on your vine The angels up in the clouds, are jealous knowing we've found something so out of the ordinary. You got me kissing the ground of your sanctuary. Shatter me with your touch, oh Lord, return me to dust. The angels up in clouds are jealous knowing what what we found. Hopeless hallelujah. Holy Son of Heaven's King. Oh my life, I'll do you. Breathe and take my breath away.
