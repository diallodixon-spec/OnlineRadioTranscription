TV, mummy why we don't have none, mummy why we poor and them rich, when me get big me a change it, daddy food looked in on the pastry, just watch me tricks, wish me could a fly go a moon on a spaceship, but man can't fight it, mummy open up the door please now, me know you a crying at the bathroom One day we are going to rock everything we need Save for my heart soon But when we open up the doors, please know Me love you not me heart, lie, I'm not diabetic The kids are right, I'm mad and I beg They put a nice roof over me, I'm red I'm big in tanks, I'm full of drugs
