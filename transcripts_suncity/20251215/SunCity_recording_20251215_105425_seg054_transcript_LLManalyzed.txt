20251215 105425 And you like to find your way to show the things that words can't say Why don't you give love on Christmas Day? A man on the street and a couple of stairs All need to know there's someone can't give love on Christmas Day On Christmas Day No greater gift is than a love People you don't know smile and are hello Everywhere there's an air of Christmas joy Maybe it's that once a year When the world's sincere And you wish you could get more Than just presents from me
