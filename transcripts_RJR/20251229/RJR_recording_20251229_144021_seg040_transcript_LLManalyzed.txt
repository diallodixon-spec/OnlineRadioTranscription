So big up to Dr. Bennett now at Church Teachers College and also to Mrs. Taylor. Look here, look here. You see what I'm telling us as teachers we get everything what they're asking for. This is what I mean. Because apart from the knowledge that they are giving and the board and what they want, the teacher them are doing great service out there. The teacher said go pay the school fee. That's right. And then now in January, she did the same thing. She gave him back her credit card and said go and pay your school fee and then she gave me a loan from Tip Friend society or grant from tip friendly society. May God continue to bless her. That's right. Oh my gosh, then when she see how you turn out to be a star in the classroom, she's almost proud Sanjay. She's always proud, always proud. Now all me feel like cry, daddy me a cry with you too.
