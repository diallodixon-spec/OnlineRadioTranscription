You don't see everybody talking about it in the media. You don't have to stop listening to me. Have you ever experienced that? Customs don't go into your package, suitcase, barrel or cargo unless you ship the item or the agent stand up right there when they might inspect it. Listen, customs job is to protect the borders, collect revenue, and to facilitate trade. Them not collect or store shipment, them.

Missing items, talk to your freight forwarder. The charges surprise you now.
