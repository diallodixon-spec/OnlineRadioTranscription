20251218 103928 night long and it's still going to happen but I just think that a lot of people are not going to be spending as much. Okay. Okay. Because people are going to want, you know, the whole excitement and hype of just being down there, you know, being in the area for, you know, that kind of vibration but it's a spending when I have and you know, a lot of people in Kingston been helping family and friends from down so and you know, it's a lot of stuff and some of them have family and friends who are staying with them now too you know so it's all different things are going on in one space yeah my experience i can tell you for the the the market goers and those who would want to um get their market stuff is that it's not like what it was a few months ago. In the market, it has become very, very, very quiet with the amount of persons that we normally would see come out. I go to the market most weekends.
