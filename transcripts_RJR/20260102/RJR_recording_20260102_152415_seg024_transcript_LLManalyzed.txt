20260102 152415 All right, no fight Just holy puppets in tonight In this year all night Everybody rockin' All night party Everybody singing All night party All we rummin' All night party Down in Trinidad Everybody going mad It's a big mass of noise and confusion Jamming on the head people jamming till they dead. It leads me to only one conclusion. I ain't going there, I ain't got no play there. So I'll do the next best thing for me. I'll be jamming, jamming there.
