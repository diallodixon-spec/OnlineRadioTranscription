20251212 165232 And even though the waves are rough, this love is tough, just love me Deep as the blue sea, deep as the blue sea Love me really and truly And even though the storms will come, no, we won't run. Just love me. Deep as the blue see. Nice and easy, so deeply we submerge under this emotion. Like an anchor, you keep me safe. I'm not afraid of the ocean. I keep you warm and cozy. You'll be coming on me arms when the storms approaching. So why funny? Whenever things like this titanic, the lighthouse, we are where I fall in. Blue as the blue sea, your love's flowing into me. And even though the waves are rough, this love is tough just like you.
