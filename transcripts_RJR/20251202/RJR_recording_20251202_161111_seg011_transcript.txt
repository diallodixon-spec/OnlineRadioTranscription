============================================================

I can never get enough I need a little more of your love I used to be caught up, I'm stuck You got me on one, I'm so high down now I don't wanna lose this fight Keep giving me love, I need your love tonight I can't fight this feeling, you got me feeling This must be the love, cause you're so real, I can't be dreaming Cause when we're kissing and hugging I wanna do it all again I'm giving into you If I'm being hungry You can never love me too
