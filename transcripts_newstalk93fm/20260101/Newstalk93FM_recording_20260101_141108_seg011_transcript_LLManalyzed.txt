20260101 141108 I need you back in my life Look at people by the truck Emotions running high We are not in the sky Death running down we hide Can't you tell that we sorrow We sorrow And we need you back and we are here for you back and back This is my apology, follow me, come and see what you mean to all of me. You're a treasure in my eyes, the greatest pleasure in my life. Cause when you're living by the knee, I'm asleep.
