I've got a hold on me La la, commitment won't set me free La la, commitment Loves play the game with me so long Started to believe I'd never find anyone Doubtless tried to convince me to give in But you didn't win When one day the sun became a shining true The rain has stopped in the skies of blue, yeah And oh, what a revelation to see Someone once sang I love you to me
