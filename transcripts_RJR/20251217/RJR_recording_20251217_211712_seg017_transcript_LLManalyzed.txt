20251217 211712 Let your light glow Take time and build up your teeth Don't make nobody have nothing over you Try if you fail, try your best Cause nobody else can not do it for you You can do anything you want to Life's sweet if it's true It's not too late to blip blip blip And start living you No matter what nobody says Live life your own way Even when the world forgets you No matter what nobody say, do things your own way Don't let nobody drain your energy Life can get lonely but sometimes you don't need nobody Uh-huh, people gonna say all kinds of things about you But you know if you pay them, don't you pay them no mind Uh-huh, a lot of them believe or try to doubt you
