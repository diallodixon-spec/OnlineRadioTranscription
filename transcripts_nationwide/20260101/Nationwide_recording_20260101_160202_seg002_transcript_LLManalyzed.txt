20260101 160202 But I want you to know You've got the best of me More than I can give In every part of me Just for you I live We shield our lives together For so many years Been through stormy weather Shielded doors and tears But oh, this change of feeling Has got me so confused Feeling so rejected Feeling like I'm used What more can I say? What more can I do? Seems I'm wasting my time Trying to show you You've got the best of me More than I need In every part of me Just for you I live You get the best of me
