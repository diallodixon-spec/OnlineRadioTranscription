What are going to be the plans to grow the economy? We know there's going to be capital expenditure, but as I said yesterday, we have not been able to spend our capital budget over the last four or five fiscal years. How are we going to manage differently now so that we can grow faster coming out of this natural disaster? So those were part of the questions that I had and other members had that we weren't able to get answers to and I asked the Minister when would she be in a position to come back to the Parliament with the details this inventory system that's being designed at one of the press conferences I went to were told by Odpem that a special system is being designed, a special bespoke, meaning custom-made system is being designed to show inventory.
