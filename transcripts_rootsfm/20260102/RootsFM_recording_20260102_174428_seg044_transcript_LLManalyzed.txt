20260102 174428 Oh, baby, tearing me apart, breaking my heart. There were times that I didn't show just how much I care for you. Last night was good, I held you tight Felt you close to me Then you played your favorite song of mine Night of melody Like pumpkin and soup you blew to me So embrace this one From the moment I lost eyes on you I knew I'd be having fun Can I have another date with you? And can we spend the whole night true?
