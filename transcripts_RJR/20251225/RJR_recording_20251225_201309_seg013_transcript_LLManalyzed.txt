Cooler, man. because you then drink a bug juice if you can't find the money for your flasks and be merry merry go and be the whole prep if you know you can't make a line of clocks and be merry merry because it's Christmas time right along with us a lift off the bus and be merry merry wishing you a yard full of love now and a house full of laughs cause we're still alive, they are still alive. I say, doctor, may be after this Christmas, yeah. Just once a year, one time. Don't tell it on the mountain. Tell it all over. Jesus.
