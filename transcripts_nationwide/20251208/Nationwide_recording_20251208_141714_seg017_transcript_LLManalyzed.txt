I'm in a bit of a limbo Still, I will make a move on this young lady Can I get your number, girl? Can I get you number, girl? I wanna call you See, I want your number, girl I wanna call you 6-5-6-5-4-7-8-5-6 I used to believe We were burning on the edge of something beautiful Something beautiful Selling a dream Smoking mirrors keep us waiting on a miracle, on a miracle Say go through the darkest of days, having to heartbreak away Never let you go, never let me down
