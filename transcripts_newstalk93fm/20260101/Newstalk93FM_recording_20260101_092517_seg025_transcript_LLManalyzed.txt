Ain't that your home girlfriend? Tell her to hook me up. Ain't she having fun? Let's have fun together. Baby, I'm with this. You know I'm, but whatever. I know I'm cute and funny. I know somebody want me. I might go celebrate. I know I make some money. Outside, lover outside. But be sick when that girl's got some outside, honey. Bathing suit, bodysuit, trying to let this body loose. This tequila 90 proof, chasing with my juice. Heard them pictures got them, let me in the locker room. And some ladies out in Vegas, Asia, we was popping boo. Booty cheeks got a shake, got some pain, let me know the time is right.
