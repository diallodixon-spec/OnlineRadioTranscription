I'm putting up with you, damn Give anything for you to pick up when I call So hard to reach you, it's like I'm talking to a wall And I know I'm a flame, I paint in your face It's too little, too late, but Baby, I want you I'm focused, it's overdue Don't throw it out the window Out the window It's saving you Is the heart of a woman
