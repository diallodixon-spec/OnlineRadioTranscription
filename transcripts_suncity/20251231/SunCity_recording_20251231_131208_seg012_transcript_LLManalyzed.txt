20251231 131208 I was born as a brilliant child I never knew what the future holds for me I can't count all the tears that fall All the struggles though I worked so hard I never knew where the day would come When I rise from the gator and the slum Now I'm seeing the rising sun Now the gators and the riches got gone Cause I'm a winner Many try to cheer me down They wanna see me on the floor
