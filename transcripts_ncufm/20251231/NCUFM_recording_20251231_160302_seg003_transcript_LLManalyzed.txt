20251231 160302 Good afternoon, Michael. Good afternoon to you listeners. Thanks for having me. I appreciate the call. Much respect every time. Now tell me something. How did your love for journalism start? When did you discover that? It was all the way back when I was going to primary school. I'm an avid reader. My mother was a Higgler. She used to buy the star every day except on a Sunday. And I always read the star from the back to the front. And the same thing when the cleaner, I would read the sports section first because my entry into journalism was through sports because I was a avid athlete, played sports. I played not the Costa Cup, but Division One and Division Two. I also played cricket for Old Abba High School, Hemmickup Cricket, and I used to play some church leagues as well for Bethel Baptist Independence.
