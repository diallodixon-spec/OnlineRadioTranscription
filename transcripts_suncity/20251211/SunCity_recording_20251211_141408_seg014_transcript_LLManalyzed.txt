Why do the rivers pull to the sea? It is the flow I get, your love, come through me, please. Why does my mind feel so missed? To be in love, to feel your love, why don't I just come before Tuesday? Why is summer starting June? Why do it come too soon? Why do people fall in love when they're always breaking love? Oh, why? Why can't we love in love? Well, why this long stance comes left out to stay?
