2025-12-12 13:31:59 I'm sorry for all the wrong I've done Here's one million won I'm sorry for 2004 And I ain't gonna mess up no more This year, I'ma take this young chance to make it real I'm sorry, baby, I'm sorry for you I'm so sorry baby I'm taking this one test to show you The loneliness of nights so long The search for strength to carry on My every hope and seem die, my eyes had no more tears to provide, and like the sunshine never gone, you surrounded me with your endless love, and all the things I couldn't see.
