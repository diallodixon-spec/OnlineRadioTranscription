And I'm a shoestraight girl, to me ting a Sam Smith I can't feel. Senseless on me sense, me nah have clue. Me flow sick, me head trip, me shot fused. Me dog dem, food, me link starved. Me crux dem, me fam fooling. Gateball swing, now a couple staves. Pushing all the air, blaze it up like a moon. Checkbook done out, flying it. Me head top plug up, me excited. Might flood out an ex-Myrus. Call it brave if you don't call it love. One game of the riches and me target all. Yeah, me target all. See me family cause me heart to drop. Paper chase need that pass.
