20251218 160707 Potato or carrot or all kinds of other things in the curry. The potato might not be so bad to me but I don't know about the carrot. I see people add people to it and I have to support them. I tell you why. Because we are encouraging them to use up what they have and it complements it well. But you just want it to cook and just done. You don't want it to go mushy. You want it to mash out in the curry. Just like the potatoes, cook until just tender. Cook until tender. And you know some eatings of the potato for in there and boil up boil up boil up and thicken up the gravy but that's not the purpose. It adds to the presence of the starch, you porridge, you know, if it's thick. No, it doesn't have to be. We were talking about Korea and you mentioned so many other ingredients.
