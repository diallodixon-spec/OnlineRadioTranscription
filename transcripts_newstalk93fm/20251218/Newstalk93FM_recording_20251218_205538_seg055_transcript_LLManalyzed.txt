20251218 205538 it's been crazy lately i've been in my fields got me rearranging all of my plans all my dreams it'll be invigorating anytime you be around same time it'll be frustrated when i see you in a crowd my eyes they go wherever girl all i do is stare and when you notice i know you will be so extra, I swear I'm supposed to feel when you're there closer I may just can't reveal for me emotions I may just want to see and do the most of you I'm supposed to be when you're there close I may just can reveal for me emotions
