20251226 130000 All right, all right, that's how we pack up and get out of here. Thank you so much for being there. Until we catch up with you, Daniel Thompson is always reminding you that if possible, be peaceable with all men and do not let yourselves be conquered by the evil. You keep conquering the evil with the good. You's Teacher's Time. Coming up in Teacher's Time, Sunday, December 28, 2025, join us as we hear from members of the support staff of both the JTA and the JTA Cooperative Credit Union as they reflect on the reason for the season, send their greetings, and look to the new year with pride.
