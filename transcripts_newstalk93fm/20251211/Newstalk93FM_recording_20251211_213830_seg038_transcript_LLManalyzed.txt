2025-12-12 15:57:03 I said five in the morning, I wake up to five of my yearnings. Fear in my mind is a warning. Pray to the one you're relying. I've been wandering all day. I tried to be fine, but I can't bed. The noise in my mind wouldn't leave me. I tried to get by, but I'm burning. And behind my mind, it runs. All these thoughts are troubling. Fighting to give up my pain. i really need i really need time now i really need i need a free mind now I really need, I really need my love I really need I need to free my mind now
