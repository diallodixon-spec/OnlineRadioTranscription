The government has identified roof repairs as the foremost priority in the restoration of homes impacted by Hurricane Melissa.

We're going to be working with Heart NSTA Trust to be able to provide young people to work with the JDF in repairing those roofs that have been damaged. In addition to that, you would have heard that there are delegations coming in from various countries that will be helping in that effort. So we have teams coming from Ghana, from Ethiopia and also from Rwanda. The JDF will only be repairing roofs that are structurally sound.
