You know the boiling scent till all the clocks melt. You know you look and you search for the wealth. You reach for me all because the land of the ox with the rain. From old boarded floor. I mama made it safe and secure. Cause the three of we there in a one room and more time she gonna kick it on the floor. Mama Rosie, money soon grease bombed. No worry about the struggle, stay gone. I mama Rosie, I from dust till dawn, man I work for the bad, we put it on I'm running in the Western Union future. Mama think she get it all but she soon get more. I moved from a stall to a store. From old boarded floor. I mama made it safe and secure. Cause I trigger with it in our room.
