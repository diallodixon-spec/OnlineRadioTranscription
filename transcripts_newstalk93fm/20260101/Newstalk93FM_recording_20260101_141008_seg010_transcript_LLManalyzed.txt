20260101 141008 I've been patient And I've been waiting Call me stubborn But I can't get over it You left and never said goodbye Those tears I cried, no I can't get over it So don't you ever let me down again Cause I'm depending on you So you better come through this time please hear my cry and if i ever let you down my friend it was a misunderstanding
