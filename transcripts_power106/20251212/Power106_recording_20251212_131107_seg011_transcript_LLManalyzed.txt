2025-12-12 13:42:24 Now I have to be walking through water because I told you the road is not good. And more than two weeks now that water is running. Oh dear. And I want to know with water is this stuff alive? How can National Water Commission have water running on the road for over two weeks? And I understand there's not a burst across. Because these pipes are over 60 years old, you know. These pipes are, the moment there is a problem with the water service, because we keep on having breaking down of pump. And when the beer get in the line, and you see the water turn back on, this is the thing that, this is some of the things that happen, you know. The bursting of the party. And my road alone is around five times they have to come and party. Five times this road.
