The song we premiered is about Mellisa. It's a wonderful song. Hurricane Mellisa that is. That one was called We Shall Rise. Also another Hurricane Mellisa song by El Fico. Stormy, Stormy Night. Awesome, awesome, awesome song. And I love this song by Busy Signal which I just played Conscious Vibes you know because we really need more conscious vibes here here not just here in Jamaica but all over the world we need conscious vibes all over the world alright so the next song I'm about to play is called Wait A Little While by Mansa Mali.
