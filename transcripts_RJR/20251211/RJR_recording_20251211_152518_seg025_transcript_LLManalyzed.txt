2025-12-11 16:27:08 With many children now staying with relatives, friends, neighbors, or in shelters after the hurricane, we must be extra vigilant. If you suspect any form of violence, abuse or neglect, report it immediately by calling 2-1-1. Let's protect our children, no matter where they are. If something doesn't feel right, speak up. Every child deserves to be safe. A message brought to you by UNICEF.
