20251230 212017 And where are you now? Now that I need you Tears on my pillow Wherever you go I cry me a river That leads to your ocean You'll never see me fall apart In the words of a broken heart It's just emotion that's taking me over Tied up in sorrow, lost in my song But if you don't come back, come home to me, darlin' Know that there'll be nobody left in this world to hold me tight. Nobody left in this world to kiss good night. Good night. And where are you now? Now that I need you. Tears on my pillow.
