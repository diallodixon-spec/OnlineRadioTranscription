20251216 142013 I want nobody to keep my mother killing For this life a day, I want to be celebrated Don't wanna waste my days, I'm telling you, until they do. Lifestyle of a crew. Make you dance to the look Don't go deluge, don't go deluge I say if it's not enough If I do 99, do the gorene one I don't know how to show you my love without love
