20260101 202813 You could be the one I die with And I pray and you're the one I build my home with I hope I love you all my life I don't wanna run away but I can't take it I don't understand If I'm not made for you, then why does my heart tell me that I am? Is there any way that I can stand in your life? Cause I miss you Body and soul so strong that it takes my breath away And I breathe you into my heart and pray for the strength to stand today Cause I love you
