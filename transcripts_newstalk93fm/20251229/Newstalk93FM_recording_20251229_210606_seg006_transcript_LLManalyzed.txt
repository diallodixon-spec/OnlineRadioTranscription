20251229 210606 I promise love is tough, just love me Deep as the blue sea, deep as the blue sea Love me really and truly And even though the storms will come, no we won't run Just love me, deep as a blue sea Wherever the wind may carry us I will never let you go One thing I have to say to you I just love when it can make me gravitate to you Give me the compass, let me navigate to you Fly up the sail on my way to you Deep as the blue sea, your love's flowing into me And even though the waves out from this love, the waves out of me. Deep as the Lucy, deep as the Lucy. Loving me down and down. I said this love is so strong. Oh no, we won't run. We won't run. No, no, no, no. Loving me deep as Lucy, deep as Lucy.
