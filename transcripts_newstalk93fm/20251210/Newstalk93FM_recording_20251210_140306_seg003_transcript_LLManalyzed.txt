You do what you want, I do what I like You ain't have to get no shade When it comes to party, I ain't such a man And I know when we come to party, we don't have a plan You don't tell me, why not who I want you? Why not who you like? We doing me your thing So when you ready, you to try and follow your heart and never find out who I like And it's your kid, so why not everybody inside? Like yourself, like yourself, like yourself Until the party's done Jamma knew you want, jamma knew you want Wine I knew you liked, wine I knew you liked Like yourself, like you said, like you said Until the party done Jamma knew ya want, jamma know ya want Wine I knew ya like, wine I knew ya like Like yourself, like it, like yourself Until the party's done
