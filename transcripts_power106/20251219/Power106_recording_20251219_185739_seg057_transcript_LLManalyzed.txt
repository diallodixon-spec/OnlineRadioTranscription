In terms of watchable features, because you have to go to more watchable games, I think that the Newcastle Chelsea game will be the most watchable one in this round because of the type of players, the quality of players and what's at stake. And in terms of Western, will they continue? It looks likely, but one never knows. But I think City should, I wouldn't put that in the category of a must watch game. Now Bournemouth versus Burnley, no I wouldn't put that in that category either. Looking here at Spurs at home, the Liverpool Spurs, they have something to prove but I don't think that something to prove would be good enough or it's going to be good enough that they die
