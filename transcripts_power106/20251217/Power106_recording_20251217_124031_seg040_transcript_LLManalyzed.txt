20251217 124031 More GCT, but no new taxes, right? I just listened to your interview. Is it really the case that the IMF has insisted that JA government not be involved in agriculture when in fact governments, including the US and the EU, subsidize their agribusiness. This is from Howie from Baton Rouge. But I don't know if it's a similar thing in saying that the government should not be involved. I suspect it's probably more in terms of ownership. I don't know. I didn't hear before John had mentioned it to be honest. I didn't hear of that IMF bit of advice, but he would know more than you and I. Afternoon, have you noticed the monopoly giants?
