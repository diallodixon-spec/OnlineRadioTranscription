And if we want to be a part of the family of God, we have to be mirroring the love that Jesus showed for others. It's tough, so let's talk to God together. Dear Father, thank you for placing us in a family, a family where out in our daily lives. Help us to receive support when we need it, trusting that this is a part of your loving desire. In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
