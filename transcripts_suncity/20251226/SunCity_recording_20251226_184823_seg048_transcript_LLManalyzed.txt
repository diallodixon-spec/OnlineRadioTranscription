20251226 184823 You're too sweet for me. You're too sweet, for me. I ain't low. I ain't true And the ground's where I go I work late where I'm free from the fall And the job gets done, but you worry some I know, but it won't stay forever babe You treat your mouth as if it's heaven's gate The rest of you like you're the TSA I wish I could go along, babe don't get me wrong We know your breath is a morning song
