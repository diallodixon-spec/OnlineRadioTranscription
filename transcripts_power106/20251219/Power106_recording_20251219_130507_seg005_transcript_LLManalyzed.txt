20251219 130507 Hi, man. Good afternoon. Afternoon, man. What's up? Me feeling greetings to the listeners, the workers and callers and everyone. Anyhow, a couple of things. I hear callers saying that if we don't call, there's a redistribution over here. And I'm saying to myself, we are Jamaicans, a lot of us are family members, mother, father, you name it, in Jamaica. A lot of us have interests in Jamaica. We decided to tune into 14106, which I think is a great station, and we decided to call, and I'm always advocating for the people who are suffering. Are you there to follow that? Not with me, no. So, okay, but if, I don't know, these people got to be sick. If I choose to listen, stare from here and listen to Jamaican station versus American, I listen to CNN.
