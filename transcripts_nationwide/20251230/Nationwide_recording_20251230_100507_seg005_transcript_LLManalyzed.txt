20251230 100507 you ask yourself, you know, how can processes take this long? How can resolving such a matter as important as this, well at least the public thinks it's important. I myself think it's important as an individual taxpayer, a person who's involved, who's rather interested in seeing good superintendents of public sector bodies. I'm wondering why is this thing taking so long? I'm like a fast bowler this morning, running in with a cherry in my hand. And you know the way, was it Walsh or Bishop? One of them was notorious among West Indies quicks for using his other hand to run with it in such a way.
