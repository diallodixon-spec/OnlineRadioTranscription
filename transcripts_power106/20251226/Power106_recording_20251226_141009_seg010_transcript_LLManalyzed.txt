20251226 141009 And we'll be together This time is forever We'll be fighting, but forever will it be So to be in your love We will never be uncovered again. And whatever I said, whatever I did, I didn't mean it. I just want you back for good. I want you back, I want you back. See, I want to back for good. And whenever I'm home, just send me the song, I'll sing it. You'll be right up on the stretch. I want to back, want to back See, I want you back for good And whatever I said, whatever I did, I didn't mean it
