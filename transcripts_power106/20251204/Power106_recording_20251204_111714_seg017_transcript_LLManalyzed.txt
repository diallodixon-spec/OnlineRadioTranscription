We're back with you. It's the bottom line, talking to Ruston Hyman. So, yes, and there were a number of other questions. Why are GPS estimating bills when they all have the smart meters? The answer is, well, you see, because some of the Wi-Fi things don't work, which we have to send them. There'll be something that will work. We are sending them estimated bill to provide them with electricity. So why don't you just hold off with that? Until it works. Or get it to work quickly. So who you are? What's your response? Oh well that's not our remit, blah blah blah blah. So who's remit? They don't want to supervise them on them.
