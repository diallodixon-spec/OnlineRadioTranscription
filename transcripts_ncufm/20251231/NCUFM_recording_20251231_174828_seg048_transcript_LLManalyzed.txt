20251231 174828 I was excited to see you. Please give her a shout out. Happy birthday and God's richest blessings to your sister, Palomina. Greetings coming from your six sons, your one daughter, your grandchildren, your great grandchildren, your great-grandmellison, the church family at the Seaview Gardens STA Church. Sister Palomina, happy birthday! So Sarah Lawrence, that song that you asked about, I'm not even sure if you will find it online now, you'll probably ever go find the album. Woman of God, blessings to you, happy new year. Sister Joyce Miller, happy new year to you. On the drive, enjoying the songs. Anne Forbes is also here, thanks to the Holy Father for the mercies of the year. May each heart, as here we gather, swell with gratitude sincere. Thank you, O loving Savior, for redemption through Thy blood. Breathe upon us, Holy Spirit. Sweetly draw us near to God.
