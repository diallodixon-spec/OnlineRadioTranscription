20251231 124626 It's very human to want everything my way. But if I don't give it, I pray for it. My hope is in your name. I'm not just asking for an outcome or praying for results. I'm not hoping that it all goes exactly how I want it. No, I'm not asking you to do or asking that you don't. I'm just inviting you to my situation Come through cause I want you to my situation
