Baby is the way that I've been spending my time I'm still searching for a fine piece of mind Decent should be running it down the line So say that love is blind But he kept saying not this time So all we need is love To keep his heart in line I'll break her pain But that's when she said Lord I feel the pain And she'll never fall in love again You have some gal a come on my premises And I fling up the thing that's between the knees And I pull up my net with past promises Oh daddy Bunga please
