Put out one date. Put up one bridal registry. From Pakistan to South Africa. You're a very loved global star. But he won't care. He won't care. I'm going to bring him. Courtney, come on.

One lady see me one time, she tell me, she hear me and Courtney not do so so well but with Christ in the center we can smile at the storm
