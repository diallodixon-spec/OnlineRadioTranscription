20251230 203821 We were once so good together Now we're living separate lives You don't love me anymore Don't hurt the way I do Crying over you You don't need me anymore Don't see the tears I cry Crying over you One was such a lonely number When I realized the score All your chemistry is changing Let me hold you just once more Cause every picture tells a story
