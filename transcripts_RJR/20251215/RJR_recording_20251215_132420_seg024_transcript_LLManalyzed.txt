20251215 132420 excellent at everything but then she's always been kind of excellent since she's been in the league so it's hard to say that it's a nothing. I like it for her because you know women's football is not as established as men's football yeah and so Bonnie Shaw doing well you know I mean young girls in Jamaica who are looking to you know go into sports and say football they realize that they can do it and there's a place for them. And that influence is growing. Yeah. I've been speaking to a couple of young ladies who some of them were involved in or who are involved in their high school football program. Yeah. And they talk about Bunishaw. They talk about what they're seeing now on the international level and how Jamaica is doing. So it's clear that the influence is there. There's a straight, true line in terms of how she's doing and then how the reggae girls are doing and then how we are doing here. But she's awesome. Now Manchester City, female squad, they are the top of the league. They just beat Aston Villa.
