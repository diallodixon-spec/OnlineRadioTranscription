here to take humanity to heaven. It's here to stop us from going to hell. The role of the Council is not to prevent war in general, it's here to prevent world war. So in that narrow sense, one might argue, it's succeeded despite the fact we've had an endless regional complex, intrastate complex. The great powers have not yet gone to war directly with one another in the UN era. The Security Council is the most powerful organ of the United Nations, largely because it's the only body that can pass binding resolutions. That is, its resolutions are binding on the entire membership of the United Nations. When a threat to peace is identified, the Security Council encourages the parties involved to resolve it using diplomacy. If that doesn't work, its legally binding resolutions can impose sanctions or authorise the use of force. UN peacekeeping forces include the military, police and civilians.
