20251230 151206 We don't deserve this. We look up at paradise, we're not gonna deserve this. God knows it hurts me, we don't deserve this, but trauma ties on me, I'm gonna need therapy. Oh, oh, oh. Because every time I hear me people cry, I hear me people crying. No fear just fool me, aye. Oh, just remember this. Jamaica, we shall rise. We shall rise. Yes, we got hope. As long as there is life. As we shall rise, rise like the phoenix. Voila, we shall rise.
