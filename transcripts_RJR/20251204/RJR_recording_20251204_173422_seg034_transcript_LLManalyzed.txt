All right. Thank you so much for staying with us. We continue with you on Beyond the Headlines. I'm Dionne Jaxmillo. Haveicata gridlock on one of the streets in Kingston here. Just making my way from Centaur. I'm going to ask you first for an overview because I see on the UDPIM hurricane relief update site it says in terms of restoration works agents it says nearly 29% and then in brackets it says 177 two-lane access. I don't know what any of this means. What does this mean?
