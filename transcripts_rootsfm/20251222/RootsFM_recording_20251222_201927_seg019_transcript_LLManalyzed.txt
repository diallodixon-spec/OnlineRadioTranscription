You're getting down because the sound is just your type. G-M-N-D-O-S-E's kicking it to your right. So come on, come on, and party hardy all night. And wiggle it just a little bit. I want to see you wiggle it. Just a little bit as it grooves. Wiggle it just a little bit, I wanna see you wiggle it Just a little bit, as it grooves. Once the DJ lets it spin, it'll penetrate your skin. It'll penetrate your soul, and make you lose control. The D-O-S-E's coming at ya Invading y'all like a body snatcher Whether if you're drunk or sober This here groove is taking over your body And now you're partying like you never partied before You're jumping up and down like crazy on the dance floor
