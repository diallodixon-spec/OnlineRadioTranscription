It goes both sides because if he has a female friend or he has a friend that has been there with him for whatever and say I don't to take to them I will say it but I'm not going to say oh stop talking to your friend or your friend have to go one side or you can't par with your friend or you can't do none of that You are very right Patrick. And some of the friendships that exist need better management. Because complacency over time and comfort.
