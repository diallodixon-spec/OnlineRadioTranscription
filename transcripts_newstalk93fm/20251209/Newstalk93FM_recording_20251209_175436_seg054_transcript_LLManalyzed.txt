You might know them but you don't know us Better back up, back up if you don't know what you a do Black talent and copper will fly through you You better back up back up if you not know what you a' do Could use them the respect which parties do I don't know what they feel like They might wonder if I'm real life Yeah, yeah, we stay up on the seaside.
