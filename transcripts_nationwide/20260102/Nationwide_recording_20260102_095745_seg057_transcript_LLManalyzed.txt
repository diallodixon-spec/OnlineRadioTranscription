20260102 095745 I don't know what to do and I went to a technician and the technician said the big man at DigiSeller said the phone is not good and he took out a chip and put it in my phone and it will get 800 megabytes per second so nothing wrong with the phone so he is saying to me that the service that they provide to my chips, that is the problem. So it's not the point of the problem. stay on the line let's take your information see if we can send it over to Digicel for some assistance for you but that sounds like a deeper technical problem that I don't know how how they would address it specific to your chip that's kind of weird but alright
