2025-12-12 09:34:35 I can't fight this feeling anymore I've forgotten what I started fighting for It's time to bring this ship into shore And throw away the old ones forever. Cause I can't fight this feeling anymore. I've forgotten what I started fighting for. And if I have to crawl upon the floor, come crashing through your door, baby, I can't fight this feeling anymore.
