20251231 201108 You love us, expiration It's just a place where we belong Nobody has to care But there's music in the air It's nothing like you've ever seen before People dancing all night long Won't you say you got the time? Wanna go there? Are you ready or not? It's only up the street Everybody's dancing And everybody's on the beat are you ready or not it's where we broke the beat Everybody's dancing and everybody is on the beat What you say? You and I should go together What you say? It's for everyone to see What you say if you want to come along with me
