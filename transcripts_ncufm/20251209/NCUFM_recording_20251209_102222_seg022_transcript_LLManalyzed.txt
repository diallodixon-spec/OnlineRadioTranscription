============================================================

We worship, praise the Lord in the night time. We worship, we worship You. In the morning we praise You. In the night we worship You. We pray, we pray, we pray to praise You. When you've done your best And it ain't good enough You can't please mankind Because you're so unjust God God understands your pain. Don't give up, go away. They don't like to see greatness around. They'll do everything to keep you down. God feels your pain. DON'T GIVE UP!
