20260101 143118 You with the sad eyes Don't be discouraged to realize It's hard to take courage In a world full of people You can lose sight of it all In the darkness inside you make you feel so small But I see your true colors shining through I see your true colours And that's why I love you, so don't be afraid To let them show your true colors. True colors are beautiful like a rainbow.
