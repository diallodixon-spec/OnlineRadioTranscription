Thank you Almighty God for being our Savior and every day we read John 3 16 for God's son of the world that he gave his own begotten son that whosoever believeth on him should not perish but have everlasting life. We are thankful that you in the midst of all the chaos of life and all the sins of humanity remember us and love us to give us your son Jesus Christ for our sins. Thank you, we praise you, we adore you, we magnify you and we say Lord forgive us, wash us and keep us. We ask all of this and tell your thanks in Jesus' mighty name. Hallelujah. Amen, amen, amen. Thank you so very much.
