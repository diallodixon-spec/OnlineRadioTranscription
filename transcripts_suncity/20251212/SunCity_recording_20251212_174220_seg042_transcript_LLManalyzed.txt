20251212 174220 As a former member of the Idoneas JOP crew, how did your early years in the camp shape the artist you are today? I never mean to prefer it, but most rhythms that I jump on, I always like the action with them, the dark with them. So it kind of feel potent, like the grimey lyrics. A certain area. A certain area, yeah, potent. Your strength. Yeah, so I'm big enough for that. But I feel, look at it, a taxi man and a police man, who are the better drivers? Any man who does something every day, you can't be better than them bro. The taxi man are the better drivers.
