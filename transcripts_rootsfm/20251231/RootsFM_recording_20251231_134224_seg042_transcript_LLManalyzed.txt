20251231 134224 Yeah But I know now that I'm way down on the night She look so fine But the way things feeling fine She a one of a kind So don't treat me like a puppet on the street Don't pull me Cause I know I can do my thing Don't talk to me if you think I'm dumb I wanna know when you're gonna come All I know she haffi come with me Wanna take her down to Paris, take her down to Rome Take her to the beach and from there to my home Candlelight, dinner, for only two alone No disturbance, no calling on the phone. No more out there, high man will roam. She give me sweet loving, that's I never leave home. Cause it's summer here, and I'm still waiting here.
