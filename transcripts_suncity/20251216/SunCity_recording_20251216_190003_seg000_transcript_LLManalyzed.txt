20251216 190003 I agree with Georgia 100%. I'm so happy that there are more songs for the ladies. Yeah, man, there wasn't much. And even when the artists sing about the ladies, they don't really sing nothing great. They must sing a lot of degrading stuff. But off recently, I'm noticing a lot more songs for the ladies. But ladies, in a 2026, may I beg you now, please stop do the dance that was designed for men. So this song you know was done by Nigiboy and there's a video where he was performing on stage and there was a girl on stage with him and all Nigiboy attract
