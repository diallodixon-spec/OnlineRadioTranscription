This is what we're working for. Jump up here with me. This is what we live for. Get up here with me, this is what we working for. Jump here with me. When our music hit me, and I asked with my love, did something take over me? They just say I'm crazy. When I feel indignity, giving me the remedy, there is no more worries, I don't fear nobody Don't tell me that anything else will be better for me Can't tell me that you thought you ain't gonna ever be happy Cause music is the only thing that can really free me I want you to join with me, I want you to let go and seize me, oh Refusing, how everybody comes in together Refusing Refusing How everybody comes in together
