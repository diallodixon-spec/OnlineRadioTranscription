We rely on algorithms, systems, protocols that are outside of our human contact. There's no eye-to-eye contact. You go out to eat with your family nowadays, everybody's on their phone around the table. Yes, really bad. Everybody's on their phone. In their own world, right? But there's no discussions, there's no family discussions. There's no, all right, what are we doing? What are we trying to achieve? What are we generating here? What's going on? Everybody's in their own world, which creates that loneliness, which reduces our immune system or affects our immune system. And as a result, one of the major results is it impedes fertility. So we're now in a global fertility crisis and all these aspects, they all contribute to the downfall of family, community, tribe, nation. It all destroys it. Yeah, and health.
