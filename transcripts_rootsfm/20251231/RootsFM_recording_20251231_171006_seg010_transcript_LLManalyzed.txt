20251231 171006 instructions of traffic personnel on duty. Opposition spokesperson on education, Damian Crawford, said he is prepared to take the government to court of what he describes as the failure to protect the constitutional right to early childhood education. Crawford says Section 13 of the Constitution recognizes early childhood education as a right and argues that the sector, particularly basic schools, has been neglected, especially in the aftermath of Hurricane Melissa. He says several basic schools damaged by the hurricane have not been included in recovery plans and have received no clear commitment for rebuilding or financial support. According to Crawford, many of these institutions are privately operated and play a critical role in serving nearby communities. The opposition spokesman warned that the fallout is already affecting communities as some parents are unable to return to work because their children have no school to attend.
