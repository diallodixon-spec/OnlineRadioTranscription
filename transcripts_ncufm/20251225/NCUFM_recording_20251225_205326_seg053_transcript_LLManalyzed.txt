20251225 205326 Dr. Smith, you need major surgery. Yeah, I know, but I want to be in good health first, and a haircut. I need to get a haircut. Why would anyone wait until they were in good health before they had life-saving surgery? Many people have this same attitude about going to God. They feel they need to clean up their life first. The problem is we all have a life-threatening disease called sin, and the only cure is Jesus. Are you trying to be good when you need to turn to Jesus?
