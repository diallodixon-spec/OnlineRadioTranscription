I'm claustrophobic I couldn't get much higher My spirit takes flight Cause I ain't alive When you come on me When I hear you breathe I get wings to fly I feel that I'm alive That I'll be the one Standing by Through good and through trying times And it's only begun I can't wait for the rest of my life
