20251222 204027 This is Kevin Downswell and you're listening to the one and only NCU FM. God bless. I couldn't seem to fall asleep There was so much on my mind Searching for that peace But the peace I could not find So then I kneeled down to pray Pray, help me please And He said you don't have to cry Cause I'll supply all your needs
