20251222 181713 every day new story you share just a waste my time cause you don't become someone else sip a lava from you, you know they touch my body oh it feels good to love somebody and somebody loves you back but it feels one sided now it feels one-sided now you don't have to return about it cause it's crystal glad now now. Guess it's bye to the good times. I'll be gone by the sunrise. I'll be better on my own. I'll better on my own now now. Nobody should call my phone, nobody should call my phone now now. This is my last heartbreak song, this is my last heart break song now. Why are you so quick to leave When we both can make it work
