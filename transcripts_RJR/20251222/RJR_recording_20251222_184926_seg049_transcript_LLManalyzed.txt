20251222 184926 Premier League, following their 1-0 defeat to Waterhouse, who ended their six-match run without a win at Jarrett Park on Sunday. Waterhouse spoiled Montague Bay United's homecoming after being away from the second city since the passage of Hurricane Melissa. It was a win that Waterhouse badly needed as they had recorded just one win in nine games. Rivaldo Mitchell provided the all-important goal in the 35th minute, taking Waterhouse to sixth on 15 points, while Montego Bay United slipped a second on goal difference behind Racing United on 26 points. Now it's been 21 years since a JPL match has been played at Jarrett Park and head coach of Mobi United Zeva Gilbert says the pitch may have played a part in the loss. We have to understand, and we know it wasn't the best, but we appreciate the football we did back in Mantigobi. That's the first thing. And we appreciate the work and effort that everyone has done to try and get the facility in general back to where it is now.
