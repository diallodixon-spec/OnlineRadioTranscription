If I have a little parcel in St. Mary's, because St. Mary's is not, only one section in St. Mary is declared. So outside of that person has been attending the National Land Agency office. So we encourage you to attend the National Land Agency officer. If you are not sure what is systematic or not, you go on the website or you go into the office and you ask. If you are in the area declared as systematic, then the process moves along seamlessly.
