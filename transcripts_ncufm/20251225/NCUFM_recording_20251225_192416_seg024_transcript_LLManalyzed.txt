When we are told to change course, we have a choice to make. Do we change or continue on the same path? Jesus gave us a choice to make when he said you are from below I am from above If you do not believe that I am the one I claim to be you will indeed die in your sins Sir, we could change course here. We have the right of way. I am NOT changing our course unknown vessel This is an aircraft carrier carrier we are a large warship divert your course now this is a lighthouse your call when it comes to Jesus what choice will you make another message from lifeline productions located on the web at lifelinepro.com
