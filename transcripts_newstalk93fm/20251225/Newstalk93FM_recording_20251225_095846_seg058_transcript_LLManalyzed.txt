20251225 095846 If you hit your enemies, enemies shine. If you're not a friend of me, enter the light. I go to see my rhythm, flow like a river. If you get your work, come on, go and sit down. I go just para, come out my jigger. I go just play, follow my lead. I'm feeling vibes on vibes. I'm taking dynamite. I blow your condo lights. You know I'm just that type. No, don't think you my vibe. Don't think you my vibes my lifestyle, I see you watchin' my movements, this bad, bad every day
