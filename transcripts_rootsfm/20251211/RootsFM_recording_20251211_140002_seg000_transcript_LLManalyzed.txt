Shoulders up, heads high. Because we're royalty. We're kings and queens. We're prince and princesses. I tell you, emperor and empresses, we walk royally. We have a prince of afternoon radio coming up shortly. DJ Stringalingalingaling, you know he has an inner city, winter city thing, inner city vibe. Just always remember that I love you like wow, right? And if his jaw will come tomorrow morning, tomorrow morning, tomorrow, all day long, we'll be live at Spectrum. Tell you, we're doing an outside broadcast tomorrow, so you can check us out live there. We'll all be there. Stringer will be there, too. Yeah, all of us will be there. And that's between 8 a.m. and approximately what? Oh my God, 4 p.m., all right? So make sure you're checking it out. But in the meantime, between times, on behalf of DJ Strike Up and I and I and I, we're out.
