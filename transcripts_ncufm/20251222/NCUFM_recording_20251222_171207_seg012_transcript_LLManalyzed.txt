20251222 171207 And finally, on the international scene, China has announced the new tariffs of up to 42.7% on select dairy imports from the European Union, escalating trade tensions between Beijing and Brussels. The provisional duties, which take effect on Tuesday, follow the first phase of a Chinese anti-subsidy investigation and are widely viewed as retaliation for EU tariffs on Chinese-made electric vehicles. Products affected include milk and cheese. Most exporters will face duties of around 30 percent, while companies that did not cooperate with the investigation will pay the highest rate. The European Commission has condemned the move as unjustified, saying the case is based on weak evidence. China says it found proof that subsidized EU dairy imports harmed domestic producers. The ruling remains provisional and could change. Talks over EV tariffs have resumed, but diplomats say major disagreements persist as trade friction deepens.
