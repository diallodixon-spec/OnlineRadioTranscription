And they actually fell right into our plans as it was. So when they slowed up, they wanted to win that badly so they were coming at us so we realized that we could get the long ball over and that is a tactic we use in the last couple of minutes and it paid off I've been coaching for quite some time now and when I turned up at racing mid-season you know I was very shocked it's a long time about 10-15 years I not seen a pool of talent existing in one place like what exists right now. For Thierry Owhitmoid, coach of Mount Pleasant, he stated that his team weren't clinical in front of goal as they usually are. They were tough lads. I think we deserved something out of the game.
