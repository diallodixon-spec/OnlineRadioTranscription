I think one of the major issues is that the minister's statements have been a little bit disjointed. I think we can agree that there is a need for the restoration one. So important, we need to get persons restored. There have been more details forthcoming at least in the last two days. We've had 5.5% interest rate. So we have some information in terms of the actual loan agreement
