============================================================

It's now time for our daily devotion and I want to ask you a question. Have you ever been in a situation you have your daily tasks to do? Maybe you ever wake up, you ever go to work, you have the daily tasks to do. Maybe your daily tasks might be getting up and going to school You have a presentation to do at school You have to try to still be social at school All I'm saying is you have your regular day to do. You have your regular rules, your regular responsibilities. For the wives, you still have to try to be a wife. You still have to put up with the kids, the parents.
