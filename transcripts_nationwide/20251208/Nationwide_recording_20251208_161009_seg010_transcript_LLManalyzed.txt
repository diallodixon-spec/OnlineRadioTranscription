life would go and I just had a lot of different interests didn't know what to do you know I was versed in this not so versed in this I didn't know it was just very overwhelming and then I just thought to myself why not do what I love doing why not do what brings me joy and so I decided to go on the culinary path and it was up from there it's listening to you it's so interesting and you're so right right that especially when you're in high, when you're younger and you're trying to decide on what to do with your life, it feels so vast. You're like, this is what I'm going to do for my entire life. I need to do this properly. But modern day teaches you now that you can do more than one thing. You know what I mean? The beauty of it. So talk to me about what drew you to the hospitality and tourism management program at UTEC. Okay so naturally seeing as I loved culinary arts and you know it can be said that the food and beverage sector and the accommodation sector are at the very heart of the hospitality industry and why UTEC in particular?
