20251219 144834 I'm pleased to be killing in the West Indies Just provide all my wants and needs I got the sunshine, rivers and trees, believe me When me see Jah, me see your way Just stick a leaf straight from me property I say Every man to the moon a philosophy I live the proper way and every reader chop the nail When the inner city of three a know it And through the dawn of country dust a drop off of the tree dead To see self poverty no real then Is what the reeds did reveal it Who knows? Who knows, who knows, who knows? Battles go and the trade wind blows Sendin' love to my friends and foes And I suppose I'm pleased To be chillin' in the West Indies Drop a fight on my parts and knees I got the sunshine, rivers and trees Victory When you win it, it's a sweet story
