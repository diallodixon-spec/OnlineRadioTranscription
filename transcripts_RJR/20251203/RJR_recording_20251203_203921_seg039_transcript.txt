In a real life In a real life, real life. I pray, man, I pray. I'm not going to wall the faith in a real life. In a real life. The amount of struggles on my face, man, I'll be given thanks in a real life and a real life. Enough use to say I'm not rich now, but still, one day I'll survive. Well, enough to see me smile and know my life. And happy more while a little rice on my grill. Still, I wall of faith and a call poncil a cigar for make it in a life, me no man happy. People might see me a smile and believe say everything fine, and just through them can see the inside more while man happy. Tuck it out when hungry or too striped, cause life be clucky like a in-law.
