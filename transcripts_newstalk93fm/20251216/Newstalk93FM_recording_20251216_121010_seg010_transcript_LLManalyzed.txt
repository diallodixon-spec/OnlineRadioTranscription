20251216 121010 With you, I want to dance the night away One jump in a lifetime, baby So don't feel away You don't like the fast life I look on the bright side, girl I go take the blame I just want you to come and light it up Just a little wind winding up. Come and meet me behind the truck and we rev it up. All day, keep throwing it back at the way you stop. Baby, no way. We could post up all the pictures you want when you're ready. I go over here, darling. You go over there. But we could meet in the middle and start a bacchanal. Play in the middle, hey. What we' do now? Jam to a rhythm in the heat. I can't eval, but in the heat, hey. What we go do now? Start a wine on it. I say compromise on it. Baby, spend time on it. Hey, I say.
