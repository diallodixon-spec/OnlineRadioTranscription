20251229 095834 from the purest heart. It's the highway to heaven. I am walking on the green highway. It's the highway to heaven. None can walk a step. But the fear is hard. It's the highway, to heaven. I will walk it up the street. I will. It's a highway to heaven. Not here for the fear, but the fear in heart. It's the highway, to heaven.
