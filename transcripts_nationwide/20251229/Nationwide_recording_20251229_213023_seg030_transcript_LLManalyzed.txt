20251229 213023 Why must I kill a dream, play in your dreams Broken arms, play your dreams These are not the level one that you meet Won't you look? It could be something Just like the rainbow you will see The sun will shine till the day you leave I've got the wonder in my mind No one can tear it apart Feel the rush Oh, feel it in the air Keep on moving it forward And live it to the end Feel the rush, oh, feel it everywhere Keep on moving it
