20251212 094935 I'm not afraid Cause you give me hope When I walk on sinking sand Feeling lonely in a crowd When everything's pulling me in every direction You're my anchor, you're my solid ground All I'm searching for is a fight You're medicine for my mind You give me hope Like the morning sun I'm not alone. You give me hope, hope. You're like the sunrise. No, I'm not afraid, because you give me hope. Such a blessing, hope.
