20251231 150607 would have won their wars they would have been hanged yeah that's how I see it at the end of the day to raise that they didn't win their wars did these people right but they were very instrumental in bringing about the the gusto and the impetus to ultimately win a number of rights for the majority of disenfranchised people in Jamaica. They did lose their lives so in a sense they are martyrs for their causes but where they had failed Usain Nani succeeded in forcing the British to cede the land commonly known today as Maroon settlements or communities. The Maroons defeated the British and have been compensated with their freedom and land. Unfortunately, since independence, successive Jamaican governments would rob current Maroons of their inheritance. It is a shame.
