So if I'm walking and I run the cane over those dots and it makes that particular sound, because it has the way how they design it, it makes this hollow sound. I run the can over that. And when I hear that hollow sound with the dots underneath the cane, it tells me, OK, I'm at the crosswalk, so I can cross here. And then because they make it into a ramp now, it makes crossing easier for individuals with wheelchairs, for example. So they have a wheelchair-accessible crossing. And it benefits even people who aren't disabled. Because if a mom is rolling her baby around in her stroller, she doesn't have to flick it up on a sidewalk. She could just push it. So that's one example. When I'm on the buses, the buses and the trains, they're outfitted with automated voice systems that announce whatever stops the train line or the bus line is on, the bus route is on. So I'm able to independently travel and get around.
