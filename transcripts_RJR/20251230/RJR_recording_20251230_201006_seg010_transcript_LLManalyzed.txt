20251230 201006 Give ready for a new time, I've seen a new sign. Mother nature is here, and I am here to believe it. We're not gonna get away With the wrongs we continue to display The scripture for the good books say According to our words we shall get there We've gotta be sure the things we've done is being worthy under the sun. Get ready for a new time. I've seen a new sign and I am thinking I am thinking you're right. Mother nature is leaving. Mother nature leaving. And I do not do believe it. I am not believing it. Get ready for new time.
