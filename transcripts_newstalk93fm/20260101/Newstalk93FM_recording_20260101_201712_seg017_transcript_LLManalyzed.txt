20260101 201712 When I'm with you I just know I'm fine You take all the pressure off my mind Patient and kind will not be going out my mind Say from the problems I don't worry cause I'm hard to find Safe like I just ran and slid across the plate Safe like we playing tag in your home base Safe like I got a big dog in the gate Safe like you one of these play in my face yeah you know i know you know that i'm that right you got a girl that wanna get right when i pass and i crash you ain't gon' dip right that's when i need you the most that's how i get right baby if i'm safe in your arms i feel safe safe like the money let it sit up in the bank safe like a cold with the make me feel safe. Yeah, look, I don't want a couple, but nobody ever made me feel safe.
