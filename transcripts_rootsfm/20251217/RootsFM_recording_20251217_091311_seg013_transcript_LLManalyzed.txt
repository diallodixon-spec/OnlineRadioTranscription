20251217 091311 that we don't rely on ourselves and we can't do anything outside of the Creator, you know, helping us along. We are not self-sufficient in that regard, you know, because when we think we do on our own, sometimes life comes and reminds us that there's one who holds the future, one who holds the world in his hand, one who dictates and is the author and finisher of all our faiths, one who causes and allows things to happen, but one who can make them better and make life better if we but trust so I want to encourage you all this morning once again to just keep trusting trusting hoping and believing keep the faith
