Wallace says the program will start at the Clock Tower on Barnett Street and extend into communities such as Granville, West Green, Catherine Hall, Lilliput, and areas along Jimmy Cliff Boulevard. Businesses, business spaces rather, including the market and surrounding commercial zones, will also be treated. The program comes amid concerns about increased rodent activity and the spread of leptospirosis following the hurricane. Health officials report that St. James recorded the highest number of suspected and confirmed leptospirosis cases nationally between late October and early December. Unlike previous initiatives, the upcoming program will include direct engagement with homes as well as education campaigns.
