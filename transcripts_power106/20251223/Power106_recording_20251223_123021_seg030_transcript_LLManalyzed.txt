Keep flammable material away from heat sources that can potentially ignite the material. Store material in approved containers and well-ventilated areas. Use caution when handling candles, matches, lighters, and other potential fire starters, and never leave them unattended when in use. Keep them away from curtains and other flammable material. That was a fire prevention and safety tip from your friends at Power 106 FM. Tracy? Hey, girl, what's up? So hold on. Why are you looking so vexed this early? They're not just that. Lisa, it is so good to see you. But sorry you catch me like this, girl.
