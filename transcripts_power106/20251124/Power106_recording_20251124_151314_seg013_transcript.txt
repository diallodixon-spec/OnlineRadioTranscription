I would say don't look at it, don't look to the end. Don't look at it as to whether it's going to be easier or cheaper to remove their name. Because at the end of the day, that's not going to matter. What's going to matter is what's going to happen to your share of the property if you die before the other person. If you want to be able to will your share to the other person, fine, go ahead. Choose joint tenants. If you, no, I'm sorry. No, that's incorrect If you want to be able to will your share to the other person or someone else Go with tenants in common if you know that you automatically want your share to go to the other person then choose joint tenancy Look on is on that in that from that perspective Not as to what's going to be quicker at the end of the day when someone dies. Because if you want your beneficiaries to get a share of your estate, that's what needs to be paramount in your mind, not what process is going to be quicker
