Proper garbage disposal and collection are essential to combat the spread of disease. Here's how you can make the process efficient. Separate spoiled food, tree cuttings, bulky items and electronic waste. Put your garbage outside your gate only when crews are near your area. Bag leaves separately. Don't burn debris. And report hazardous spills or illegal dumping and blocked access. A message from the Jamaica Information Service. A production of the Jamaica Information Service, the voice of Jamaica. In the aftermath of Hurricane Melissa, Power 106 FM remains committed to you, our listeners across Jamaica and the diaspora. Our mission is clear.
