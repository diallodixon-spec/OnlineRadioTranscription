2025-12-11 23:10:51 Your list makes 96.1. Can y'all feel that? Jig it out. Here I am in the place where I come and go in Miami, the base and the sunset low every day like a Mardi Gras. Everybody party all day, no words, all play, okay? So we sip a little something, leave the rest to spill. Me and Charlie at the bar, running up a high bill. Nothing less than ill, when we dress to kill. Every time the ladies pass, they be like, I will. Y'all feel me? All ages and races, real sweet faces. Every different nation, Spanish, Haitian, Indian, Jamaican. Black, white, Cuban, or Asian. I only came for two days of playing. But every time I come, I always find up staying. Just Just the type of town I can spend a few days In Miami, the city that keeps the roof blazin' Party in the city with the nannies on All night on the beach till the break of dawn Welcome to Miami, Campanile Ami Ami
