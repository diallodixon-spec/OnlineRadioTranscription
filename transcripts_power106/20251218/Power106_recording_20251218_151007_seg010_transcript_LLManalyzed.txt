The only thing that you have to do is to come with some money in your pocket to make sure that they do not leave here with the produce that they have brought. I really want to again thank Sean Christie for the work that he has done in making this possible. It's a significant undertaking and we thank Annika Nelson for the inspiration as well to get this done. And to the entire sales team. Could not have done this without you. Thank you so very much for working to make this happen. All right, so we're going to do a little bit of a switch over. Can we just bring up that music again while we do that and then I'm taking your calls.
