In your embrace, will you cover me? With love, will you take me away? To our place, joy will shower me. The sun shining down on my face. My feet buried deep in the country. The breeze blessing me with your grace. So free, I am dancing in victory. I long for this feeling again. Beautiful song! This is the voice of Carissa! Meaningful song! You're now tuned into The Sisters, 30 minutes of continuous female music on Sun City 104.9 FM. Just a moment, do you see?
