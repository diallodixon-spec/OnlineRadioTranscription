Standing outside my house Trying to apologize You're so ugly when you cry Please just cut it out Don't tell me you're sorry cause you're not Baby when I know you're only sorry you got caught but you put on quite a show really had me growing but now it's time to go curtains finally closing that was quite a show very entertaining But it's over now. Go on and take a bow. Grab your clothes and get going. You better hurry up
