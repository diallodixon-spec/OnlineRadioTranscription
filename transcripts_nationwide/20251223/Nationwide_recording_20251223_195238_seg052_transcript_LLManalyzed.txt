Yeah, man, Ricky is fine. Ricky is fine. Yeah, so, Ricky's fine. Yes. Go for it. I just want to tell everybody, people listen to you guys. Everywhere, I am on the road every day. And people listen to you,. The only thing I don't like is that they brand us as labor rights when they hear nationwide in our vehicle. But that's fine. We can deal with that. But hail up everybody, everyone who listens.
