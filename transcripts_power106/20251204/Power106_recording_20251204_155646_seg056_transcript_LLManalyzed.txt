============================================================

led to the development of nanostructures that increase solar panel efficiency by reducing reflection and improving energy absorption. The unique scales on butterfly wings inspire the creation of similar structures that can be applied to solar panels. This technology can boost energy output and make solar panels more cost effective. By mimicking nature, scientists have made significant advancements in solar energy harvesting. And he's also commenting here, the $6.7 billion package for Jamaica's reconstruction is significantly larger than the Marshall Plan, which provided $13.3 billion in aid to post-war Europe, equivalent to approximately $137 billion in 2024. Thank you, Mr. McDonald. I just want to remind you that those of you who have flow phones you can call through, please feel free
