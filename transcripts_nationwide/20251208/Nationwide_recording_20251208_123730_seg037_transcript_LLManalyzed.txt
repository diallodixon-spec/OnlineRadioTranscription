From every whisper to every commotion. That's rubbish. The KSAMC cannot investigate itself. Every news story unfolds here first at Nationwide 90 FM all Jamaicans. Different people. It's not a matter of a GLP or a PNP. I think it's more like where it is that you think you're comfortable, what support you can offer to make the country better. Different views. Most entertainers, they're not amenable to management, so the only thing that can ultimately structure them is the court and the prison. Public opinion. The voice of the people at 6.25 p.m. weekdays during Nationwide at 5. Tune in to Nationwide.
