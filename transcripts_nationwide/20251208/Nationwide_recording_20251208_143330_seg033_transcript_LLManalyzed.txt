Everything is going alright Remember the darkest parts of the night It's just before daylight Yes, I can, yes, I can Achieve anything with the right plan And for moving like a mountain where I stand A better life for my fam I've been there before What if I fight to fight Would I need a thousand books to write I've been there, before Everything has gone alright Remember the darkest part of the night
