Madam Badr, we're dead to cloud. We're dead to cloud! We want to take out a disc and put in a new one while you're at it. I use my shoes as your body, brace up for my body. Take out the disc and put in the new one while you ride it. I'm done getting ready and I still want more, want more of your body. Me know you love it when me see your body. When me, when me, when you, is you, is you Do you wanna know my thing? No, can't even stop that deal Don't be shaming it to what we know But the love's so strong and you can't see it, they're the angels
