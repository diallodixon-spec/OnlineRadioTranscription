20251231 144729 in theory you will agree but when it comes to the practical we recognize how we have fallen short dear father dear god you have loved us with an everlasting love a love that is patient a love that is forgiving a love that is faithful and you have called us to love each other the way how christ loved us the way way how Christ loves us. But we need some teaching this afternoon. We need some conviction this afternoon. We needs some correction this afternoon. And we need to be set on a right path. Teach us how to love others that same way. Soften our hearts where it has grown hard and help us to reflect your love in our words in our actions and in our attitudes in Jesus name we pray amen
