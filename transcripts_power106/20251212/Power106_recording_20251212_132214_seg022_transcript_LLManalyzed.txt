There are lots of other people in the Parliament who are not quick-witted or as eloquent, but they are in control of the subject matter. I've been watching Fable from the day she came in and was an advisor to the Ministry of Finance When it was when they are 1.5 was was being put on And I followed her every say ever since and I've listened to her. It's not a quick judgment I've listened her in the in the Parliament. I've listen to her as Minister of Education. I've listened her now as Minister of Finance. I was doubtful about her ability to run that ministry notwithstanding her qualifications. She has not proven me wrong. She has done some things in the Parliament that I've never seen before.
