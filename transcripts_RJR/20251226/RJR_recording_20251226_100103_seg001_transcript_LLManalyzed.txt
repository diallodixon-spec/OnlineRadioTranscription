20251226 100103 Starts are with the families rebuilding after Hurricane Melissa. We stand with you and remain here to provide the care and support you need. Wishing you comfort, strength and a peaceful Christmas. Dean's deals with the issues. It's Teacher's Time. Coming up in Teacher's Time, Sunday, December 28, 2025. Join us as we hear from members of the support staff of both the JTA and the JTA Cooperative Credit Union as they reflect on the reason for the season, send their greetings and look to the new year with promise. I'm sure being part of this great Sunday afternoon teacher's time program will be your pleasure. Sunday December 28th at 4.30pm on this station, Radar Jamaica 94.
