Oh, baby, all I want for Christmas Is you, baby All I want for Christmas is you Baby, all I want For Christmas is you Sometimes I feel I've got to run away I've got to get away from the pain You drive into the heart of me The love we share seems to go nowhere And I've lost my light For I toss and turn, I can't sleep at night Once I ran to you, now I'll run from you
