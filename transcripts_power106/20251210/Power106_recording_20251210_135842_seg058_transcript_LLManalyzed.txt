============================================================

was here with us earlier for making sure at least some of you could hear us loud and clear. Our producer Daven Thomas. You have something lined up Christmasly to play us out. I noticed what they're not doing on the job you know. Even at lunchtime when they played Luciano rather than Christmas music. This is the man. What matter turn me into the Grinch, it's Christmas time. And the other thing I've been doing, I've been watching all the Christmas movies. My goodness me, there's some rubbish out there. My word. But I guess everybody trying to make a buck. All right,'s it for the program today thanks for being with us tomorrow is what Thursday we do it all again both sides of this story coming up next keep it right here on paw106fm bye for now
