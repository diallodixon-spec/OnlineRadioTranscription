============================================================

One can touch my heart like you Or make me smile the way you do I finally I finally found someone who Who really true Let us be And when And when my strength has come and gone Because where my heart belongs. You took all my pain and erased every stain. Jesus, you're my everything. The cross. The cross you did not show.
