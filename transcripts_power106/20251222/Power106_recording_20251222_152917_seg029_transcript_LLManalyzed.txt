20251222 152917 To claim ownership of someone's property, all you have to do is show that you have paid their property taxes and you show that you're paying their property taxes on a consistent basis so you can claim the property. That isn't correct, you have to actually be in possession. But just to say, the government is not going to release that information to you. So you have to just be diligent, you know, pay your property taxes early. Pay, you you know you can go ahead and know and start paying for 2026 to 2027 and beyond if you don't know the exact amount pay based on the previous amount but no unfortunately the government won't stop a stranger from paying your property taxes and they won't tell you who's going to be paying your property taxes i know it's contradictory the titles of titles are public documents. You can go to the title office, request a title just by giving the volume and folder numbers or the address, but you can't find out who has paid your property taxes. But again, just please be very diligent. Thanks so much for tuning in.
