20251216 200604 I'm going to win this year. I feel it. And if you're not the progress, don't even come near. I'm so focused this year. I'm going to get my share. Progress, progress, progress, progress. We in Australia, I got to find something God to give. Oh, Lord, bless the life I live. Bless the life I live, ah-ah-ah there's the life, the life I, I live.
