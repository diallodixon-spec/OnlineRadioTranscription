Donald Trump for drug charges. The records show Hernandez was released from the High Security facility in West Virginia on Monday. Hernandez was found guilty in March last year of conspiring to import cocaine in the U.S. and of processing machine guns. He was sentenced to 45 years. The President said Hernandez had been very harshly and unfairly treated in a social media post announcing the move Friday. U.S.-operated flights returning deported migrants to Venezuela will continue despite President Trump's assertion that the airspace of the South American country should be considered closed. The government of Venezuela President Nicolas Maduro on Tuesday announced that the twice-weekly flights will go on following a request from the Trump administration. That reverses a Venezuelan government Saturday announcement indicating that U.S. immigration authorities had unilaterally suspended the flights. An overflight and landing application submitted Monday by U.S.-based Eastern Airlines requests permission for arrival Wednesday.
