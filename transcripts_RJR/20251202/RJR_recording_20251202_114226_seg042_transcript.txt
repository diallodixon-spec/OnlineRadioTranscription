Why are we stifling the youth and push them into a corner? They have talent markets. JFF needs reorganizing because Mike, the president, I was somewhere. I happened to meet in a public place. So I was like, Greg Butler, didn't you know he was years ago? And he was making a point to me. He said, listen, a lot of these young players can't be playing in different clubs across the world. You have to engage them. And I'm talking about maybe 2009 or thereabouts where I saw him. And one of the confidence centers came up, I was talking, and he was saying, listen, and I saw him, he has been doing it with some of the young players, getting them into some of these clubs.
