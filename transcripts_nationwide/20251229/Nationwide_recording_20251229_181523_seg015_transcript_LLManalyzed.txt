20251229 181523 take into consideration their needs as well in this whole growth picture. One of the things she indicated minister is that the very 2 billion that is going through the DBJ she says that it's lacking in context and she also indicated that the access is difficult and because of that even though the money is made available through the DBJ the members are not taking it up and she provided a solution saying why not remove the DBJ fees from the loan facilities, price it in the fees that they can pay over time instead of having to pay that lump sum at the beginning. Okay, so that's a suggestion that I will certainly take up with the DBJ to see what they can do on that front. I have no problem taking up that suggestion with them and to see what can be done. In listing what was in the budget as well, I forgot to mention the development of the micro market that is especially targeted to MSMEs.
