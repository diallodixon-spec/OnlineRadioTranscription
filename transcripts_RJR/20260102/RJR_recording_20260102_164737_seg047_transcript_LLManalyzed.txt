We're solid as a rock If we eyes to the top And we solid as a rock Looking for what never back And we solid as rock When we stand firm And we never run from Why we a live up past Them a never stand Anywhere the groove go That a where the groove stand Never them come from hard And it's never rise, seven drop But we solid as rock General! Stemper! Solid! Never budge!
