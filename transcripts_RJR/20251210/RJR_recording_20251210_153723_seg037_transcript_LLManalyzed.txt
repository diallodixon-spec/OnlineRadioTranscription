If instead of buying how much thousand dollars you spend on shoes, let's say you give somebody an investment of some stocks in, say, a stock like Trans Jamaica or a Sagicor NCB. I'm just using some examples of something that you can buy now that's actually going to appreciate in value later on and help with your financial prosperity in the future. So I would like us to think more less in terms of spending, this consumer spending on items that we have today and it's gone tomorrow and to focus more on instruments that will actually build our wealth for the long term. And that's not just for gifting by the way, I want to say gift yourself something like that. And you know what?
