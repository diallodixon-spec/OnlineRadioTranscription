20251226 112209 We better let it flow, my baby Don't nobody want no drunk heart Don't nobody want a two-timer loser My baby Don't nobody love you like you are Till it takes whatever it'll bring your way There's a thing of it You deserve respect But you can't demand respect without change, darlin' Comes a time when we could go on with out. So let go, let go. Let it flow, let it flow. Let it flow. Because everything is going to work out fine. Let go, let go!
