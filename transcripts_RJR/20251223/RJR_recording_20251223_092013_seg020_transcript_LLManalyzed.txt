And once we move beyond the whole idea of the transaction in exchange of money, above and beyond that, there is no way asked for the supervisor and them said she should come. You know, she was at lunch and I waited and she come and asked me what's the problem and she took my card and everything and said, you know, she keep on trodding the floor, you know, to get somebody to do it. And then this guy came out and this guy, you know, started and him say, what's up and don't move at all.
