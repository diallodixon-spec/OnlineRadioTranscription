I try to teach you But I need some lessons I need to give it all I try to live but I can't I don't know why you're the one Drowning me out of my mind You don't need no other body Only you fit on my body You don't need no other body Say now me they mess up my mind And now me they make you free of your mind Say your body talk to me nice Say now my love you didn't need for your life Yeah our love no be like Say yeah we did together yeah day and night
