as UK government we have and we've done that quite quickly. We had repatriation flights, we've been able to offer support through the High Commissioner's Office to make sure that people could use commercial aircraft to leave as well as repatriation. So we have really stepped up where we've needed to and crucially responding to what people in Jamaica actually wanted and needed. So those sorts of conversations are always ongoing and how we can do more and Dawn is absolutely right to challenge the government in that regard. That's her job as the APPG chair and as a backbench MP and as a colleague with Jamaican Heritage. I know it's something that she cares deeply about and I suppose my work is to make sure that we deliver as much as we can in the context of listening to what the Jamaican government and Jamaican people want. So the work is always ongoing in that respect. OK, if I could quickly move, because I know we don't have much time. The British are going, recently or at all, no longer sharing intelligence with the United States about suspected drug trafficking.
