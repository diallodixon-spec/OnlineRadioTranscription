15 minutes getting up to the top of the hour. 15 before 9. The sound of Eddie Lovett for you. Started off at Boris Gardner. Followed by the songbird Cynthia. In between the mix we had the likes of Dennis Brown. And we're down to Eddie Lovett right now. Some Christmas cheers for you. As we keep things coming all the way, keep things going all the way up to the top of year. To do what we all should do. Spread the cheer. See happiness on the children's faces.
