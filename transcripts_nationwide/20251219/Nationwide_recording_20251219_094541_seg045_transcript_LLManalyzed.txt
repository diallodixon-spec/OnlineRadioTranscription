20251219 094541 we do know is that we are aiming to get light back to all of the major towns at a minimum in the parishes of St. James, Hanover, St. Elizabeth, and Westmoreland. It's really challenging, especially over in Westmoreland and St. Elizabeth, because of the extent of the damage to the network, to the infrastructure. So we are on track and steadily making progress, and most customers, the guarantee I can give is that most of our customers will have their supply back by Christmas. Some will be going into the new year without electricity, unfortunately, but that is unavoidable given the level of devastation caused by this category five hurricane. For those of your customers in those small pockets on the eastern end of the island who are still without electricity, is there any timeline for those restorations?
