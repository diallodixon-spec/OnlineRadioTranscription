So when you have an all out ban, you're not really fixing the problem. You're just saying, okay, just stay off it. But the demon still exists. You haven't slayed the dragon, is my point. So you haven't really stood up to the dragon. But then again, if we stray into the realm of regulating the content itself, which I'm sure to this point, because obviously you don't want illegal things on your platform. But when you stray... And by the way, they don't even do a good job of that. Preventing illegal things or just outrightly harmful things. But when you stray too far into the regulation of content, aren't we more treading on this notion of freedom of speech? So we're creeping up to the line but we're not crossing it.
