20260102 111615 roots FM it's 60 minutes after 11 o'clock apparently I'm having a zoom issue persons are hearing me but I'm not hearing them and we're not hearing them through zoom so I'm gonna have to do some phone call and so only you're hearing me I'm coming to you next via whatsapp all right taking the pause. Soon come. Now we close it off for the end of the week with Fire Friday which are the talk of the street.
