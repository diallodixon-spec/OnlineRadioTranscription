20251224 101411 the biannual show, okay? Number one art exhibition in the country. Not many places. There's a, I don't know, when I was a young man I saw there's a painting that was in the collection of Edna Manley. Hope to Uncavement has paintings, well I don't know who has them. Marva Phillips, who used to be at the Trade Union Institute, she also owns some of my paintings. Dr. Gordon and some other people in HR. By the way, whooped and passed, you know? No joke, when I tell people that I have exhibited with Edna Manley, I don't mean the college. I've actually been in the same gallery with Edna Manley herself, the mother of Michael. Okay, okay. Yeah, okay. So the argument then is... Yeah, man, yeah, man. But the argument though is that I'm not colorphobic. You get it now, yeah?
