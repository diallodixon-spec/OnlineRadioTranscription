And let me tell you, at the end of the day, if you can't understand the importance of regional support and diplomacy, and that there are not times, there are times when, as leaders, there's no way we do chess like that. We're too smart and wise and pragmatic, looking at the broader picture. And I still maintain, and I know too, for instance, the difference in the approach of President Irvine Ali of Guyana. He's under pressure, Guyana's under pressure. They want to claim part of Guyana's territory and all that kind of things.
