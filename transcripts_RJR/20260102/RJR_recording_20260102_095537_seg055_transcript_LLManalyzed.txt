20260102 095537 I'm waiting with my pen and notebook for the thought of the day. Thank you. And wondering how come I didn't get to the thought. Well, I didn't get the thought just yet, but I will give you the thought now. And the thought is this. Progress, not perfection, is what moves life forward. Even a small step is still a step. So we don't have to wait to be perfectionists because really and truly we can't be perfectionists, only God is perfect. So the reality is progress, not perfection is what matters.
