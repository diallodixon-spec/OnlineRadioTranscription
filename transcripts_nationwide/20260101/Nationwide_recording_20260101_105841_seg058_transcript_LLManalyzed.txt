20260101 105841 Moving at the speed of light into eternity Tonight is the night You join me in the rhythm of ecstasy Feel the melody and the rhythm of the music around you, around you I'ma take you there, I'ma take it there So don't be scared, I'm right here, baby We can go anywhere, go anywhere But first, it's your chance, take my hand Come with me, it's like I waited my whole life For this one night It's gonna be me, you and the dance floor Cause we only got one night Double your pleasure, double your fun And dance forever, forever, forever Forever, forever, forever
