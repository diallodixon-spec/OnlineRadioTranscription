Everybody feed em all now Worry for people make bad minds take them over Cause dem a try to face it all alone So me a call for the strength of the father To help them work for me all Keep bad mind out of my heart Keep negative out of my tarts Me know I say it easy to pray to Ramway So Jah Jah please guide me every day Keep bad mind heart. Give negative out of my thoughts. First I bless me strong It doesn't matter, before me mind get bothered Better you flip it round and let me mind get madder
