Now we're a lot wiser, a lot smarter, and we can look out and follow your progress as you go forward. Thanks for being on the show. Yeah, thank you so much for having me. Bless up everybody that's listening and, you know, just get the kids out there surfing and come enjoy the beach. That's what it is. You are very inspirational. Thank you very much indeed.
