20251215 111007 you know. How much does JPS need? Is it 350 or 150 million US? 350. That was the broad figure, right? Uh huh. Now, of that amount, Chris, and based on the understanding I have, the government has sought to distill how much the JPS would require to restore energy because having suffered the ravages of a category five hurricane, we are seeking to ascertain, all right, what do we need to do to get those areas that have not yet been restored, restored in the shortest possible time? Because recall, the JPS school was signaling some time ago that we may have restoration in May or as far as June of 2026. It was very much untenable. So the JPSCo, and this is the kicker here, the JPSCo has its own aspirations as to what it will want to do with the grid or its network.
