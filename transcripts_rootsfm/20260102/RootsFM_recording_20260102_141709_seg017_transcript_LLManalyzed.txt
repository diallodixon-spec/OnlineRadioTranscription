20260102 141709 Because I've had the time of my life I've never felt this way before Cause I swear it's the truth so I want you more than you'll ever know So we'll just let it go, be afraid to lose control Yes, I know it's on your mind when you say, stay with me tonight. Just remember, you're the one thing I can't get rid of.
