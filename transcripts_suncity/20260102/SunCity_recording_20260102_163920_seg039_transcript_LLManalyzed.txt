20260102 163920 I can't find nobody that can do me nothin' Who was like a jockey that can't do me nothin' Under the street lights, they be tellin' you somethin' You say you love me and that you show me Trust and it touch and you say me own it You're gone and farin' and now you left me lonely Hello, you don't stop for me So, girl, you better give me love and keep for me Never gonna disturb me, stamina from ever since for me Me just wake up from reminiscence To drink my man and my muggle, it don't make me feel lonely I squeeze up the revolution and deep, for me Never had the stamina from ever since, for me Me and the mcginnis are reminiscence It's a reminiscence, you're loving and I'm feeling lonely
