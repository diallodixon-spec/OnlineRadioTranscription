20251222 111415 I'm wondering if something is wrong with me because I could understand easily over all the hurricanes we've been through I have understood the people all the time why they said they don't want to move because I hear them all the time saying the last time they moved not only did they lose the things at their house because no hurricane came and people robbed them but they also had a horrible horrible experience at the centre and I keep hearing people saying death is easier then you have a system so bad that death is easier anything mandating people to move to move solve the problem I hope
