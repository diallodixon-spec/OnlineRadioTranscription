up in the Parliament, meaning the House of Representatives or in the Senate, hear them talk about include us, involve us. And I'm saying to myself, these very people clamoring for inclusion and involvement would not even do the very minimal thing of pointing their constituents using their social media platforms to the avenues of assistance. Why not tell the farmer through your social media pages about what RADA is doing in terms of getting them back into production? Why not tell them about the NHD, DBJ, SLB, JUTC But I'm just calling out a set of people who are in my view hypocrites because they are on the one hand clamoring for inclusion and involvement and then not include themselves in the way they ought to. I said this to you as I run from you.
