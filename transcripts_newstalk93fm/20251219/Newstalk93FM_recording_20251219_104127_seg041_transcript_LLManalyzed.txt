20251219 104127 I wanna be in your life until the night is over I wanna hold you so tight, so tight, coming closer It's been a hell of a ride, but every single moment You were there by my side Whenever I'm broken, you make me feel low Whenever I'm lonely, you're there for my soul Wherever you are, girl, that's why I call my own Whenever you doubt it, I'll be letting you know
