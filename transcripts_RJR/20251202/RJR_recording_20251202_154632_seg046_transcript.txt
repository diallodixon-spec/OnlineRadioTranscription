And today we're just talking about his creative process and his vision that drives Levac Design. So before the break, Cavell, you put it in a more, I would say formal way when we're in the break, the aesthetic of Levac Design. What is that? All right, so I think our aesthetic is our structure and the cleanness, you know, technicality. We do everything very neat and our stuff is built to last. Okay, and you specialize in men's suits? I specialize in suits overall. Suits are females as well. Is there particular fabric or material that you enjoy working with the most, particularly since you're doing suits? Yeah, I like working with wool. I like working with natural fabrics overall. So wool, linen, things that breathe and properly built up and they will last.
