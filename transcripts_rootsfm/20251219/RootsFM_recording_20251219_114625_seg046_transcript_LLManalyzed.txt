And then also the next one who is being showcased tonight is the first female, because remember culture works is about the balance also, which is another important component of this, the whole platform, because the queens tend to be minimized or they're driven down a part of sexiness, you know? And marginalized. And marginalized, my sister. So ensuring that we keep that balance, both in terms of His Majesty and Queen Empress Menin, but also, you know, Chakula and myself representing the family, you know? Oh, yes. Oh, yes. So we do everything. We all have cribbing at the background. So anyway, any female with a baby, she can put on her youth for the time being. So this sister now who is, you know, a part of the launch, her name is Zuri.
