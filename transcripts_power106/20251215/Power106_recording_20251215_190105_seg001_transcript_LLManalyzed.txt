20251215 190105 and everyone is excited. You know, there's nobody at all that heard about this launch or came to the launch and they were not excited that they were not looking forward to good things, that they were not forward thinking, you know, and looking at the benefits of these opportunities that we will get as a result of this volunteerism. You know, so everybody is on board. I can't say that we have not gotten the support. And I know Mr. Samuda at the helm, steering the way, and Novelet being, you know, our air captain, that we will get it going. And that as founding members, we'll establish, you know, really establish this organization and get it moving and taking it in the right direction. Well, you can count on our support here at Power One on the States. Thank you.
