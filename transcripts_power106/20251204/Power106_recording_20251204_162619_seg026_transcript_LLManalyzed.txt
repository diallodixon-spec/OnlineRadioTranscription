All right, so the book really, it would have shown us the gaps that we need to do further research on. And one of those gaps would be AI, just considering how we integrate it and whether or not AI is a threat or is it an opportunity for the TVIC discipline. Even with the crisis, and I go back to Melissa, we have to think about reviewing our curriculum to make it more resilient. So the book has shown us more the other areas we need to look at in the future for research. I wonder as well, you know, these days we talk about, people will tell you that I learned this from YouTube or I learned this from Google. So they're going, they're doing this work by themselves, but I wonder whether or not they are indeed getting the core competence that they need at the level that will make them professional in some of these skills that they're seeking to get.
