20251230 131108 Let me down So you better come through this time, please hear my cry And if I ever Let you down my friend It a misunderstanding. So if I took it for granted, then I promise I'm through there. I go drunk, like I never drunk. Waved like I never waved. Pined like I never wanted to. Just to show you I saw you. I saw you. And I need you back in my life. You got people by the truck. Emotions running highpin the sky Tears running down we eye Can't you tell that we started We started And we need you back in we lie I need you back on my mind
