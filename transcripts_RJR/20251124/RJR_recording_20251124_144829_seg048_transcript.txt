I went to the people from the community to talk about what is happening on the other street and so forth, but I thought that this time I needed some time to find back myself. When Melissa came, I was grieving. In April I lost a brother, and I just buried my sister in September, my younger sister. I was in a state of grief at the time and I realized that I had to snap out of it because something else is happening that I need to deal with and to get on with my life. So I went back to some of the things that I learned when I was in my master's and I had to find that inner strength and resilience. I was basically now trying to focus on the potential of good things and acknowledging that this has happened.
