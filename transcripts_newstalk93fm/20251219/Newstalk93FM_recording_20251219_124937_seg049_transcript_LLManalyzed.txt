20251219 124937 Peace of mind That's just what I seek to find, oh yeah I ain't in the mood I just need some solitude, oh gosh But everybody's trying to talk to me and nobody's trying to hear me out So you've got some things to say, honestly you just all move your mouth The things you say, it makes no sense and we're not at a time it out Leave me alone It's best you just leave me out See what I'm trying to say is that this caused me so much pain Feeling like I've got no control over my own brain
