It is going to be difficult. I remember the challenging. No question about that. In fact, there has been a perennial challenge, and that has gone on for quite a few years. All right. The change now means that you have taken certain steps, for example, as it relates to things like fees, entities, and so on. Talk about the changes that you have had to make. Well, we have to adjust the entry fees. There's a number of adjustments that have been made, and we are looking to incentivize some of those persons to ensure that we get those entries, reduce the fees in some cases. We want as much persons to participate. You know, the number of horses has been decreasing over the years and that's something that we want as much local breeders to participate in. So we are looking as a collective group to offer as much incentive for those persons to have their horses enter in the sale.
