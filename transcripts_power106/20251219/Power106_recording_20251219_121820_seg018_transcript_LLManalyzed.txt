20251219 121820 reflected on the Winder's approach to their innings after spending almost two days in the field. I just think they pretty much took a pitch from the New Zealand boys' book. It's a pretty good pitch. Outside of the odd ball, probably jumping a little bit or staying down a bit. I think the guys are really positive in going about their business this evening because after a long day in the field, it could mean two or three down with just some lazy shots or what's not but you know really really at Stumps on Day 3 at the Adelaide Oval, an overall lead of 356 runs. The head was 142 not out and with them at the close was Alex Carey on 52. Uzman Khawaja also made 40.
