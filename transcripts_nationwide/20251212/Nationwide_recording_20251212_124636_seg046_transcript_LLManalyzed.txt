2025-12-12 13:16:04 So we are committed to helping in any way we can. We're here with you, we're walking through this and we're trying to rebuild as the OBE is. As I can tell you, the residents of La Cove, not only La Cove, but all the stops we've been on so far, I can see the gratitude for the books, the parents and the students taking them up. So thank you so much for your partnership and your support in this endeavor and all the best for LMH Publishing and the team. Thank you as well and thank you to you as well and the team we are very very happy about what you guys have been doing to help the community. All right thank you so much Kerry and have a good one. You too bye bye. Kerry and Malcolm they're the marketing and communication
