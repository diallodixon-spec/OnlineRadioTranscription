Yeah, okay We all know don't be one of the original sound selector, you know in Jamaica and internationally So the whole idea was to finish off the year with a nice, you know, old school. Nice, like a reggae old school vibe. Nice, nice, lovely. No, because I was, when I heard Lucien and Friends, I'm not gonna lie, I thought that there would be more artists, you know, more artists on it. But maybe it's more of an intimate setting where persons can come in and sit down and just hold a vibe and really experience each set of music. Because it's gonna be live band,? No not live. We're working with tracks. Just tracks but they're going to be performances there so people can just come and sit down and enjoy themselves. Is there a cost to attending? Yes well $4,000
