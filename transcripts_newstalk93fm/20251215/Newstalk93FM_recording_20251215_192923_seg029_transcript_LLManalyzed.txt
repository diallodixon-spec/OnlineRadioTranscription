I can't live without you, I can't be without you for too long Cause when I'm around you, I feel like the heavens is coming down I feel it in my soul soul every time we on the road is a miracle. A million strong come together for the mass it's so spiritual. Oh look out, oh look out, look at fire in the waste up there. The pretty girl don't play, they take the whole line well. They come for the mass, how you shine on me.
