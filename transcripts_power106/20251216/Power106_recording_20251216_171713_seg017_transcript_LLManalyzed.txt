20251216 171713 is threatening to shut down automotive production in Europe and the U.S. Ford CEO Jim Farley said he was in Washington D.C. this week and that it was top of mind with every official he met with in the government. He said a resolution could come just as they're about to run out of chips, but they need a quick breakthrough to prevent production losses. With the Trump administration getting rid of regulatory fines for missing zero emission vehicle mandates, Ford will see a big financial benefit. Prior to that change, Ford was going to have to buy $2.5 billion of ZEV credits this year, but now it expects most of that to go away. Thanks to the administration easing up on emission regulations, Ford will no longer have to constrain production of vehicles like the Tremor and Raptor which are in high demand. Ford says it's making big progress on improving its quality. It cut warranty costs by 450 million dollars in the third quarter.
