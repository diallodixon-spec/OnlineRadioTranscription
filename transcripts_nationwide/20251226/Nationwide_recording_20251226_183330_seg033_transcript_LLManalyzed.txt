20251226 183330 For so long, you and me been finding each other for so long. The feeling that I feel for you is more than stronger. Take it from me. If you give a little more than you're asking for, your love will turn to gold. I just want to be your everything. Open up and live in your heart and let me be The things you are to me And that's all of it on a string If I stay here without you, darling, I'm alive I want you layin' in love, I'm left to break free I do what I'm meant to be, I'll live my life
