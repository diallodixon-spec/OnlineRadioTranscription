20251225 115548 We'll be partying for hosting, wash towels for toasting, and caroling down in the snow. We'll be spearing those stories and tales of glories of Christmases long, long ago. It's the most wonderful time of the year. There'll be much mistletoeing and heart-soothing glowing when the ones are near. It's the most wonderful time. It's the Most Wonderful Time. It's The Most Wonderful Time.
