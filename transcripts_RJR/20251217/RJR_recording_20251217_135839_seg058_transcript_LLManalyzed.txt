You're the best gift God blessed our family with. I love you Moya from mom Erica, dad Michael, sister Michelle I I'm thinking, and Brother Gavin. Sister Judith White, how are you? She's from the Cornerstone Mission Oom Babu Church. Birthday greetings to you, coming from the whole congregation. Also a very special birthday to my goddaughter, Kejoa Bowen. They call her Bless. She's at Germaine Court in Westchester. Her birthday was yesterday, coming from Mr. Mack. All right, do we have any more? Yes, my sweet niece, celebrating her birthday today.
