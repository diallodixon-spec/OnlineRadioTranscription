20260101 174027 We call them modern days you lot Spread us a broom But your teeth and tongue gonna let you down Reward for your words shall be profound How screw all you want but go loo and drown Me slew you like a lion with a stone from a crown Not even the dogs at death Don't know all of Babylon shall escape in this time So word to the wise, choose the right side And now to be hindered by your foolish pride I said no weapon formed against Zion I shall prosper, prosper So tell who's a force right by me All guard down disrespect and face disaster Cause dem a bad fighters Hypocrit people critical to side glass, we call dem a turn the eulers, spread as a brumas.
