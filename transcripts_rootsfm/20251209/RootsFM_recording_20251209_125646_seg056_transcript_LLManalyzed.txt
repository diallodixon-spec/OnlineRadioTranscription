============================================================

Now we turn our attention to the skies above us. Right now, in the corporate area in Kingston, we are sitting at 32 degrees celsius, and we're getting a bit of rain in the area. The air quality is fair, so no major concerns there as we move through the afternoon. By 1pm, things could calm down a little as we shift to mostly cloudy skies and we warm up to about 33 degrees Celsius. Around 2 p.m. it stays on the cloudy side and falls slightly to 32 degrees
