During routine maintenance, which is conducted throughout the year, firefighters first ensure accessibility to the hydrant by clearing debris from around the structure. The valve box and barrel of the hydrant are then cleared. The barrel, the upright column of the hydrant, is flushed to remove impediments and confirm that water can be accessed from the hydrant. Once this is complete, the hydrant is given a fresh coat of paint to signify that it has been recently serviced. In 2023, as part of its hydrant maintenance program, the fire brigade inspected 2,465 hydrants and repaired 432. We have seen a significant improvement in our high joint network over the last five years and this is as a result of infrastructure development across the country and in particular in the Kingston and St.
