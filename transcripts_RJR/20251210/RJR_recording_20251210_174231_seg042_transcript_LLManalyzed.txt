I told him that this child was abducted, and I found her in his company, so I'm holding him until the police come on. We called the police, and within a minute or two after the call made, a motorized bike police came on, then a jeep, and then another jeep, so I must commend the police for their swift response, including the search party who I saw earlier. But then this thing happened like, I saw the post in the group, 4.37 p.m., and by 10 minutes after five, I come into contact with the man and the student. This is just miraculous, you know. But what really urged me to really turn back is that there was something about the man and the girl walking. The child looked distressed, she looked tired and she looked like she just wasn't going, wanted to go with him.
