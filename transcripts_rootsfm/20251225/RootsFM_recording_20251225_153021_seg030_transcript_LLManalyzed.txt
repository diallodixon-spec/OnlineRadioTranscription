20251225 153021 Yeah, we'll have to give thanks my mother and father teaching me the real values of Christmas and the season. It wasn't about money for us, it wasn't about vanity for us, it was about us. You know what I mean? Crime free. Live it out and spend some time with your family and friends. Sing it. Thanks for watching!
