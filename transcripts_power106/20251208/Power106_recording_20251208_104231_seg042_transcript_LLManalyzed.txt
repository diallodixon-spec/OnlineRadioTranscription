How much rum and boom produced in Jamaica? Have you ever done that? Well, I don't know. I don't know where to have to... I don't know which... Right across Jamaica, I'm going to say that. Every day as them and them wake up, sir. You see them on the corner. No, no. The way I'm going with this conversation with Roman Boom, I talk him to my liberal right, my liberal right cousin in Kingston. And so we're discussing Roman Boom and him say, he didn't call your name and him say, yes, Roman Boom, that's what they live by. Yeah man. He said that's what they lived by. No, I thought you were just a flying kite. No man, we don't tell the things when we go somewhere. The things we observe and we go all over the place and see it.
