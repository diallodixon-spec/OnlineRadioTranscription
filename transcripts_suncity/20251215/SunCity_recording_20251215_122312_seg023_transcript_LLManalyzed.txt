20251215 122312 calling on all Jamaicans to support the rebuilding of our nation. We're calling on corporate Jamaica and small business entrepreneurs for sponsorships and to advertise on our station, which will create funding to allow Mother in Crisis to carry out their many programs, which will, in return, assist in the rebuilding process. For more information on Mother in Crisis at Sunset Radio, email us at motherincrisisatyahoo.com or visit our website at www.motherincrisis.info. Young people just messin' up today, yeah.
