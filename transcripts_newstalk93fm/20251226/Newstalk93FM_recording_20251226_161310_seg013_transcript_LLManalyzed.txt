20251226 161310 I have a lightning spirit Early in the morning I had it Me cooler ready, me ice done ready Me punching that's automatic I have a lightning jumbie A kind of energy inside me And it ready for the rum, ready, ready for the rum Ready, ready, for the rum Ready for the action A spiritual encounter In me soul taking over Telling me to start up me drinking And do away with good behaviour So let we go Let we go down the road Let we go It is action time Let we go It's back and on time Let we go. It's back on our time. There we go. Hands up. This vetting spirit of me feeling good.
