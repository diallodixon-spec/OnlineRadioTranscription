20251222 143929 96.1 FM I feel a trembling when I wake Come back and give another break I feel a shiver Running up my spine This hurting, hurting feeling It hits me all the time Every time you go away Seems I can't live another day Oh, my bed, it is so cold You've got my happiness on hold Oh, I feel a ton of joy and my heart gets warm Thinking about you holding me, squeezing you in my arms But as the day turns to night
