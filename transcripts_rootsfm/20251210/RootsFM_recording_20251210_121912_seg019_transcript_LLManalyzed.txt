really forgiveness an excuse is a feel sorry thing and forgiveness is I am sorry I speak of excuses I speak of forgiveness and I speak of love what did the widow in the gospel say she could have an excuse she could have said she was poor. She could have say she had nothing. And yet she chose to dig her pockets and give the little she had. The widow in the gospel had many reasons to give an excuse. She was a widow. She had no other help. She was the only one. She she was poor she had nothing in the pocket apart from the coins and yet she gave everything with no excuse god saves us by love not excuse you
