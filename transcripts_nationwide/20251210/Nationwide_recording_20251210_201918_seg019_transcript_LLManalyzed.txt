I think it's my first time seeing Monique. Not really so sure, but I do think so. I also see Sharon Brown over there on YouTube. And over on my TikTok, I know Rachel T. Henry is there. I know Bagwell is there. I see Lisa Cole. I think Lady Loud is also there as well. I see Lori over there too. I see more Island. If a woman has never orgasmed with her partner, does that mean he's the problem or she is? I know this song, Jerome, isn't really about women, women per se, celebrating women, all these things, right? But can you play Dexter Ups? A few, please and thank you.
