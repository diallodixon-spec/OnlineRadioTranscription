20251226 193724 I don't need a reason or a season to spend time with my friends. I don't need sleigh bell sounds or papergrounds to go back home again. There's 51 whole other weeks where everyone's still here. Forgive me if I'm not the guy you call for Christmas cheer. There's no magic in the lights and snow No love under the mistletoe No joy for me in going broke There's nothing that we need You call it a holiday But when it's done I'll need a break From all the smiles I know I'll fake I can't wait for Boxing Day
