20251215 215436 Yes, I know And I know I have a big heart and a bit in it And I wonder if I end up in it in my head Don't you remember Don't you remember The reason you love me before Please remember me once more Been together for a while now Growing stronger everyday now Feel so good and there is no doubt I will stay with you As each morning brings a sunrise And the flowers bloom in springtime On my love and you can rely I will stay, with you
