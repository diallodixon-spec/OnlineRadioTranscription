20251224 174017 I tell you that we all need love Jump up and show me love Wind up and show me Love Together till we all need love with my head to the ceiling stay I'm drowning alone and I'm lost in my feelings Somebody send me a sign cause you know that I need it Can't even come back to me cause you know you're my healing
