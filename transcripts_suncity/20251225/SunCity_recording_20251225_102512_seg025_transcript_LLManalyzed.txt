20251225 102512 I want to break down and cry. Too many days, too many hours, I'm still burning to the brim. When the feeling ain't the same in your body, do what you know know, let it go Cause love party ain't jumping like it used to If you know that's what it feels like I wanna know When were you When I said I loved you And when were you when I cried at night? Waking up, couldn't sleep without you. Thinking of you.
