20251226 183819 I've been feeling lonely, I need someone to hold me Come on baby, hold me I've been feeling jaded, don't know how I should play it Tell me how to play it Now you, you've been moving on Let me know, can I come along better days, I could use a break, can I get an amen? All I do is just sit around, wait for better days
