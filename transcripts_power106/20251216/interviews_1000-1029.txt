**Interview 1: Chris Thomas, Senior Investment Advisor at Mayberry Investment Group Limited**

In a recent interview on Power 106 FM, Chris Thomas, Senior Investment Advisor at Mayberry Investment Group Limited, discussed the current state of the equity and bond markets. Thomas noted that some of the stocks declining yesterday included Anwarke Insurance Company, Fontana Limited, and Express Catering. He also mentioned that the bond market is active, with bonds like Mauritius Investments and Maybell Investments Limited being traded.

Thomas highlighted that the company is currently raising $1.5 billion in Jamaican bonds, which has received massive requests for funding, particularly from individuals impacted by Hurricane Melissa and those looking to get their businesses going for the Yuletide season. He emphasized the importance of promoting micro, small, and medium enterprises, which provide relief to individuals who may not qualify for the general banking system.

**Interview 2: Lucius Wright, Veteran Public Commentator**

Lucius Wright, a veteran public commentator, joined Power 106 FM to discuss the 7% increase in electricity bills in December related to electricity consumption in November. Wright criticized the administrators, stating that they are "totally in it" and that their conduct is unacceptable. He argued that the Office of Utilities Regulation (OUR) has failed to monitor the sector effectively and has approved the 7% increase without justification.

Wright emphasized the need for a change in the administrative level, including a total shake-up of the people involved. He also stressed that the government must promote policies that improve the efficiency and productivity of the economy, rather than relying on perpetual debt. Wright suggested that the Jamaica Public Service (JPS) needs to look at its risk management process and build more storage onshore for liquefied natural gas (LNG) to prevent future disruptions.

**Interview 3: Ferris Jackson, Global Portfolio Strategist at British Investments Limited**

Ferris Jackson, Global Portfolio Strategist at British Investments Limited, provided an update on the international market. Jackson discussed the recent reaction to the Federal Reserve's decision, noting that the market initially went up but then realized that the Fed's actions may not have a significant impact. He highlighted the weakness in the job market, particularly among certain demographics, and the need for the Fed to balance its actions between the labor market and inflation.

Jackson also discussed the K-shaped economy, where the wealthy are less affected by changes in the unemployment rate, but the people at the bottom are more sensitive to these changes. He emphasized the need for the market to evaluate the data and monitor the Fed's actions, as they may not be in a hurry to cut interest rates. Jackson concluded that the market may move sideways without the support of the Fed and valuation being high.
