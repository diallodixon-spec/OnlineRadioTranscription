20260101 153322 I read a lot about Albelo Fanti. I used to sit down and watch Rex Necrophon and Eddie Thomas dance. So I kind of looked at that African rhythm and I realized something when I was watching the Rex Necophon and Eddie Thomas that any way they jump it, they move their body. I said, wow. I don't watch them, they bounce, OK, out of it. So from there, I said the drum is a body movement. And fascinatingly? People move. Wow. So you have to put accent somewhere in it. So I learned that. So I tried to put that in the music and then I listened to a lot of James Brown records. Because I used to dance, you know. And what are you saying to me? To dance like James Brown, you know. You know what I'm afraid of? I'll pass you over here and we'll take the floor more.
