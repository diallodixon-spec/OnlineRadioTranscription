20251224 161108 All I am is a man I want the world in my hands I hate the beach but I stand in California with my toes in the sand Use the sleeves of my sweater let's have an adventure head in the clouds but my gravity center touch my neck and I'll touch yours you and those little high waisted shorts she knows what I think about and what I think about one love, two mouths One love, one house No shirt, no blouse Just us, you find out Nothing that I wouldn't wanna tell you about, no Cause it's too cold for you here
