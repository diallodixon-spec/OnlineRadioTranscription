Just like a pastor at the altar, I just need one more. One more entrant, we just need one more, there's someone in the crowd today who needs to win a prize. I just need on more. One more person. Them that are ready? Alright, so let us count, and it's all guys. Alright, so DJ String, you have to make sure you say. No, man, it look good, man. The young men are leading. They stepped forward first. So, they're willing to take one, two, three, four, five, six, seven. We're going to heaven. Alright, so come over some more. Come over some more so the audience can see you. And it's going to be decided by noise that you make for them after. All right? So, oh, we're going to judge this now. We're going to judge based on charisma. If them look like them, know what they want to do.
