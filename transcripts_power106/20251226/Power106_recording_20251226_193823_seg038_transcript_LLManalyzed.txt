20251226 193823 I used to cut my sleeve with my heart I'm totally sharing my thoughts And ever since then, she's taken advantage And I just can't stand it all, no, no Think back to when we started Things were so different then We'd spend the whole night talking Now she ain't listening From the moment that I said that L word It's like everything done changed Now she's got the upper hand, acting overconfident This ain't what her brother planned, not now So many things are better left unsaid
