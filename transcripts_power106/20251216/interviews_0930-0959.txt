**Interview 1: Michael Leckie, Farmer and Immediate Past President of the Small Business Association of Jamaica**

In a recent interview on Power 106 FM, Michael Leckie, a farmer and the immediate past president of the Small Business Association of Jamaica, discussed the alarming rise in inflation rates, which jumped to 2.4% in November and 4.4% year-over-year, driven primarily by higher food prices. Leckie emphasized that the agricultural sector is not recovering quickly enough, leading to a significant increase in import prices and, subsequently, rising inflation.

Leckie stressed that the focus should be on getting the agricultural sector back on track as quickly as possible, highlighting the need for affordable financing for farmers. He criticized the current policy rate, stating that it is too high and does not incentivize investment in the agricultural sector. Leckie argued that the governor of the Bank of Jamaica and the Finance Minister should work together to lower interest rates, making funding more accessible to farmers and helping to contain inflation.

The interview also touched on the issue of imported inflation, with Leckie noting that the high cost of imports is being passed on to consumers, leading to a rise in the cost of living. He emphasized the need for policies to support the agricultural sector, stating that "we need policies, we need something to drive youth and design and move the economy."

Taylor explained that the campaign is crucial, especially in the aftermath of recent events, which have damaged the supply chain and affected local producers. She emphasized that the goal is to provide a platform for local producers to showcase their products and connect with consumers, both locally and internationally.

The interview highlighted the importance of supporting local businesses, with Taylor stating that "every purchase is going directly into a sustainable business." She encouraged listeners to visit the Things Jamaican website, social media pages, and physical locations to explore the range of products available and support the local economy.
