you see it means it also tells you that a lot of people are fearful of government badness and people don't want to call a spade a spade you see once you're speaking the truth you know you shouldn't be afraid the truth will set you free and what we saw yesterday was a disgrace. A monumental disgrace. And needs to be fixed. So I just want to use this opportunity to call on the Prime Minister. Fix the finance ministry. The ministry needs to be fixed, you need to find people put in there. And you need to look around Mr. Prime Minister. And I don't know if you can call about Nigel, but you might have a PM 500 million US a year. Because where am I now? 400 million, 400 odd million a year? 400 odd million Jamaican a year. So you might have PM 5 or 6. I mean, he's not the the best but he's certainly not the worst. Far better than what we have right now. Exactly. Far better.
