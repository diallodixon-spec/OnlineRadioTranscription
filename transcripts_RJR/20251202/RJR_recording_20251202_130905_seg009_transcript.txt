It will be okay, it's okay Don't you be afraid of this world, my child It might not last like rainy days Even if you put that dear different name There's always gonna be those thoughts When you feel like you're gonna cry, just cry There ain't no shame inside the thoughts Just take your time Pressure makes you die It will be alright Don't you be afraid of this world, my child
