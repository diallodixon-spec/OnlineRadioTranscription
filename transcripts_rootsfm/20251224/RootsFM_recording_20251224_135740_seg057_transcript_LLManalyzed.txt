20251224 135740 I'm reaching out across this winter wonderland. Knowing you're reaching for me, yeah, yeah. Those Christmas lights will shine twice as brightly. Even though we're not together tonight. It's all right. I'm making all these jumps cause I fell So I can be with the one I love Cause it don't feel like Christmas time without you No it don't, it don't baby She makes me hope I'm falling down And my heart beats but there's no sound, no sound
