20251219 163829 If I come to Italy, we could be nice to each other. Nice to each other. Wrong for each other. Right for each other. Can rise to each other. Rise to each other. Don't know where the switches are. And where you keep the the coloring And I'll probably crash a stupid car And make your life a misery But we could be nice to each other, nice to each other Wrong for each other, right for each other And right to each other and rise to each other Rise to each other Cause you know I don't know the classic stuff And it never works, you know it So can we say we'll never say no?
