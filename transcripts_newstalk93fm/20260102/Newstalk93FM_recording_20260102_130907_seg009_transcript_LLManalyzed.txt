So bring a case of the room Careful you don't drop it to go break on the ground Family a come and everybody watch out We not go fear till the back and all done Party time till the morning come Me love it when you jiggle it up for me How time that you give me the property Let me live in your fantasy Sweet gal, gimme jam, gimme jam And if you're coming down for this season Vibes and link it up Girl dem wine got a feeling Sweet like honeycomb
