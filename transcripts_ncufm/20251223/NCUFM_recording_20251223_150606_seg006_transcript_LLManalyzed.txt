20251223 150606 I did not. I did not. It was my favorite science. A lot of people are like physics, out of all. But I also like maths, so it tracks. Oh, you're one of those. Yeah. Yeah. You know, we celebrated International Mathematics Day yesterday inside the drive. And then we looked at chemistry. So it was more like a maths and science type of day yesterday. Cool, cool. But I should have seen you with like a flag or something since you love math. I did not recognize that yesterday was International Math Day. We can't see you flying a flag for next year. I try to remember, yes. Yes, yes, yes, yes. So, with that said, Katie, and thanks so much for being down here in studio you're most welcome oh yes most definitely it's a nice cool bleak day yeah in Mandivu you know just once again rainy mm-hmm I don't mind it though I don't mind when I'm in my bed
