20251216 153421 Overwatering now, if you're watering the plant too much, that would be the yellowing of leaves. You have mushy stems or the soil smells rotten or sour. The fix for that is to stop watering immediately. Yeah man, that's a new word I'm giving y'all immediately remove the plant from the pot and inspect the roots and for the black and and if the roots are black and mushy for the ones that are just trim them off yeah and then you repot in fresh well draining soil. So that will be your watering habit or pattern whether you're under watering or over watering. Next you have to improve your soil drainage.
