Vision 2030 Jamaica. You know what I mean? Take away yourself from trouble. You know nothing, no, sweet life. The gift of life. Walk away from trouble. Stay away from strife. Life is to live through the best in life. You only live once. You're not live twice, yo. Follow the road on the righteous path. Still focus and conscious. Put your tatters. Don't make the wicked them corrupt your heart. Do the right thing, becoming the worst case of your soul. Take away yourself from trouble, from trouble. Because it come in a double way. Take away yourself, from trouble, come trouble.
