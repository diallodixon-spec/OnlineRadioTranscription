it off like wow inna di arena we no lie low good sense in miliar is all I grow Rastafari now, Rastafari know Big 45 bust it off right now Man of the survive is a fight right through Never dim your light in a high Shiloh Rastafari no Oh it is a distant thing you see another day Never lose faith when trouble come in your way Reality created by your thoughts and what you say Secrets in the spirits, the ancestors they now play No lenience for the grievance or the risky No allegiance or obedience to the trickery Them sent legions from regions for the victory But the heathens and demons are the feet we Make some string up, kick it off like wow Inna di arena win all I know But since the milla is all I grow Rasta far right now And Big 45 bust it off right now Man of the survive is a fighter
