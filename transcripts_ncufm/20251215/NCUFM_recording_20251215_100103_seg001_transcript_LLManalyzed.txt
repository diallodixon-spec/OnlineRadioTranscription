The session was organized by the British High Commission in partnership with the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of National Security and Peace. National coordinator of the school's safety and security branch, Richard Troupe, said the training aligns with the ministry's ongoing efforts to tackle violence in schools, particularly gender-based violence, which he noted is often surrounded by silence. He stressed that violence seen in schools often reflects what children experience at home and in their communities, adding that parents were included in the session for that reason. According to Mr. Troupe, unless harmful behaviors are addressed at home and in the communities, they can become normalized in school environments.
