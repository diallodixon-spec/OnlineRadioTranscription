Oh, I'd like to know where you got the notion Said I'd like know where you've got the notion Rock the boat, don't rock the boat, baby Rock the boat, I don't tip the boat over Rock the boat, Don't rock the boat baby Rock the boat Ever since our voyage in Latvia Your touch has thrilled me like the rush of the wind And your arms have held me safe from a rolling sea There's always been a quiet place to hobby you and me Our love is like a ship on the ocean We've been sailing with a cargo full of love and devotion. So I'd like to know where you got the notion.
