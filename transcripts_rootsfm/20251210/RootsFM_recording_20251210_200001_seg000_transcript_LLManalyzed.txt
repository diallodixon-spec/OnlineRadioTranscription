============================================================

And all I asked was, love in return. It's not fair for me to decide which road to take or where to hide. I am just a victim of love But loneliness is all I have Here I am, here I stand Crying for love I knew I never had. I'm on my own, so on and on. If only you ever knew what I am going through. Because I love.
