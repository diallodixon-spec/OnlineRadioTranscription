20251226 212321 I just want you come and bite it up Just a little winding up Come and meet me behind the truck and we rev it up Whole day, keep throwing it back at her while you stop Baby no way, we could post up all the pictures you want When you're ready, I go over here Darling, you go over there But we could meet in the middle and start a bacchanal Play in the middle hey, what we gonna do now Jam You know, I want your company. And it's nothing too risky, limited liability Don't worry, if you try all the things I like You could still be shy in the morning So don't feel away
