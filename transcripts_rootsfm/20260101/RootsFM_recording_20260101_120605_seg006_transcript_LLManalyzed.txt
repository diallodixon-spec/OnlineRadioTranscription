20260101 120605 Gotta catch the plane at 7.30 Why haven't you come to say goodbye? Time is running out and I'm still waiting I'm so lost without you I could die Yesterday you said you loved me Everything seemed to be fine Today you're not here I'm so lonely It's the waiting that's driving me out of my mind Don't know how I'll sing in that big city How can I perform if you're not there?
