Blood woman and child, for you I really have so much love. God of ills and kinds will fade away, only you could make thy proud. Blood woman and Child, for you I have so much love. Who knows who will turn up on your road just to make things great. Oh yeah, you and the children, I see them in front of your face. I say, keep them close as you live, increase their faith. Marcus, God, we don't save him, save the future from us. Oh, naturally, nature is the way to your needs. You were born as the one to conceive. Now let my joy put away your grief. You want to tell us, food is the grease.
