20251215 100103 I'd like to give thanks and praise for all human beings you know that you have created in your image and likeness omnipotent omnipresent give thanks to plants and animals which are a beautiful part of your creation. Give thanks to the elements of life. Eat air, earth and water. But I give thanks to music, you know. But through music or mosaic, I made an instrument to manifest the holy works. Omnipotent, omnipotent.
