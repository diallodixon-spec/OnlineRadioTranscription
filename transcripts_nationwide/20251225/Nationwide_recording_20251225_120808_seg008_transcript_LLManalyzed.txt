20251225 120808 of Hurricane Melissa. Friends of Jamaica, including development partners, experts, and international institutions have mobilized alongside us, offering support, guidance, and cooperation as we work through recovery. At the same time, Jamaica's ability to respond has been strengthened by years of responsible economic stewardship. Because we planned, saved, and made difficult decisions when times were good, we were not left powerless when the storm came. As we move forward, we will continue to build on that foundation, strengthening disaster resilience and working with our international partners to build forward, to build stronger, and build smarter. Over the past decade, Jamaica has undertaken difficult but necessary reforms to put the nation on a strong footing. Those sacrifices are yielding results. Debt has been reduced. Investment is growing.
