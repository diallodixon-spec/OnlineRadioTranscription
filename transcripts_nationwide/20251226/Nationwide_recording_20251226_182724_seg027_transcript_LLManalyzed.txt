20251226 182724 Since I met you, I've begun to feel so strange Every time I wake up and wake me That's funny You say that you are so helpless too That you don't know what to do Each night I pray that you'll never come away Wake you up and take your love away So you feel the same way too And I wonder what it is I feel for you Could it be I'm falling in love? Could it be?
