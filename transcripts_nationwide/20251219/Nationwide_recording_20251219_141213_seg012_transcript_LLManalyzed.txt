20251219 141213 We're all just like children With our own Christmas tree Singing you tight carols Now that's Christmas to me Another year gone by New Year's almost here Merry Christmas all A happy, happy new year A jolly good time of the year Sleigh bells in the smoke Everywhere you go People having fun Cause it's a merry time of the year A jolly good time of the year We're all just like children Come that one special day
