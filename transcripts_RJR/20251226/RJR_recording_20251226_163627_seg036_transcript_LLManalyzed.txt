20251226 163627 I gotta show I choose you. Like the flowers in my room, but they were not from you. So I set them on fire. Got that miraculous stature on you, nigga. Before I got all choked up, here comes my ninety-seven. I'ma show me a girlie who's a girlie. Again, no really. I need you up in the middle of me. No villa, I'm streaming. Watch thirty millimeters. No villa in me. When you say i spend my life for you i die for us, i die for us i spend my life with you from the end of the picture my life with you you keep me calm inside me too you find your place 94.5.
