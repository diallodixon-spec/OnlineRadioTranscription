20251219 182924 so far on facebook but let's see if the youtubers have chimed in yet because what's this who am i says please stop sending me christmas happy season greetings send me happy black river disaster recovery rebuild greetings that's good news who am i what have you done for black river if you don't mind me asking because that seems to be you know i've seen that argument a lot people are saying even i remember when people started to string up lights in the East folks were saying hey how are we doing all of this Christmas celebration when there are people over in the West that don't have anything left and there's a little debate going on about whether or not it was even ethical for folks in the East to be celebrating while folks in the West were picking up the pieces and that's kind of one of the major things that led us to having this public opinion and led us to posting this one to see if folks were feeling the same way or if they were like you know something no man i mean yes the west is bad but you know stuff stuff
