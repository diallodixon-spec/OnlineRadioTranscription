I could over there. But we could eat in the middle and start a bacchanal. Play in the middle, hey. What we gonna do now? Jam to a rhythm. Heat a carnival. Put me in the heat, hey. What are we going to do now? Start a wine on it. I say compromise on it. Baby, spend time on it. I say compromise on it.
