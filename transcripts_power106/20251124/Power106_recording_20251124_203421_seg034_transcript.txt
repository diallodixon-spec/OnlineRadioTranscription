You know we are not going to get them here for Christmas I have to be frank with everybody. But we should start to see some coming in by late January. Prime Minister Dr. Andrew Holness. Purses impacted by Hurricane Melissa will also have access to rebuilding grants. The distribution of these grants will be done on a tiered basis and utilize the same framework that was used in the support program, which was rolled out after Hurricane Beryl. Recovery takes time, but together we will rebuild stronger. For additional updates, stay tuned to GIS radio and official government channels. Thank you for listening.
