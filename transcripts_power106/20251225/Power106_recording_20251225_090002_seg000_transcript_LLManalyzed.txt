20251225 090002 They do the best to spread a little Christmas cheer You don't have to, you don't have to hold back Until the wind blows everybody... You'll listen to Power 106 FM. The time is now 9 o'clock. Power 106. They're rockin' around the Christmas tree at the Christmas party hop Mistletoe hung where you can't see every double child has to stop Rocking around the Christmas tree let the Christmas spirit ring Later we'll have some pumpkin pie And we'll do some caroling You will get a sentimental feeling When you hear voices singing Let's be jolly dead Dolls with vows of party Rockin' around the Christmas tree Have a happy holiday
