20251222 212420 I'm telling you, I'm telling you I'm telling you You're the one, you're the other I'm going to give you your love When they say the sky's the limit As you made the switch to I'm a friend, you have seen nothing There's a way to argue because I'm bad, I'm bad You know it, you know I'm bad I'm bad, you're more than enough And the whole world has to pay some light, just to tell you once again, who's bad. The word is out. You're doing wrong. They're gonna lock you up. They're going to lock you up.
