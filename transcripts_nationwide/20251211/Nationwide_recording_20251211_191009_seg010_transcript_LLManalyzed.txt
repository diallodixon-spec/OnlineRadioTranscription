Could the state regulate what kind of education my child receives? I see that slippery slope you're trying to go down. It's not in that slippery slope, it's real. Because in my mind, how much should the state regulate it about my child? And there has to be limits, yes. Precisely, but where do you draw that limit? This seems, this don't seem like the line to me. Because I could then ask the question, could the state determine, for example, whether homeschooling is appropriate anymore? Meaning, meaning, meaning to say that we shouldn't have that anymore because perhaps the child is missing out on the socialization aspect. It just seems dicey to me. These are things I think countries, states, societies will have to decide individually on their own as to how they go forward but I think we should just not allow government to trot our own in that area. I don't think it's avoidable. I think to some level
