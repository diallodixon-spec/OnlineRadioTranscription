20251225 131811 I don't wanna go another day So I'm telling you exactly what is on my mind See the way we ride in our private lives Ain't nobody getting in between I want you to know that you're the only one for one for what I say Nobody gonna love me better. I'ma stick with you forever. Nobody gonna take me higher. I'm gonna stick with you. You know, but you know how to appreciate me. I'mma stick with you, my baby. Nobody ever made me feel this way. I'm gonna stay with you, my baby Nobody ever made me feel this way I'm a stick with you And now Ain't nothing else I could need And now I'm singing cause you're so, so rare to me I got you
