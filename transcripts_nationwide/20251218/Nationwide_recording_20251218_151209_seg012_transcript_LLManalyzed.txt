If you're just pulling up to the E-Zone and you don't know what's going on, or star YouTuber, it's the YouTuber that leaves a comment first in the chat. And at the end of the month, if they have the most stars, then they walk away with a gift, courtesy of Mark's Superstore. And we've got Rick Jam NYC right now. He's just been doing it big all year. He's definitely the star YouTuber of the entire year. And he says, put some respect, Parmenium. 11 out of 13 stars. Hashtag star YouTuber. That you are, Rick. That you are. Want to say a big shout out to Jerome Robinson coming in second. Nicole says, check, check. Karen Smith in the building. Annie Smith, Ravage. Jay, welcome to the show. What else do we have early with us on this here Thursday? Boy, may I tell of Jerome a week? Just a flight, a flight, flight, a flight. Do it, do it. Chris Ann Martin, how you doing? She says, hello, welcome to the show. Whilst we got early, I saw Mario pulled up to the spot saying, happy pre-Friday, E-Zoners. It's a tantalizing Thursday. Time to throw it back
