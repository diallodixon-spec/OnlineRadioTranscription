20251222 214829 Such a funny thing, but every time I'm near you, I never can behave. You give me a smile and then I'm wrapped up in your magic. Music all around me, crazy music. Music that keeps calling me so very close to you. Touch me, your slave. Come and do with me one thing that you want to. Anything, baby, just let me get next to you. Am I insane, or do I merely see heaven in your eyes? Bright as stars that shine above you in the clear blue skies. How I worry about you just can't live my life without you baby come here. Don't have no fear. Oh, I guess I wonder why.
