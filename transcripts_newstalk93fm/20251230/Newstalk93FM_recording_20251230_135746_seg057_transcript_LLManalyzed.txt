Cause I'm into you quite intimately. And maybe one night I could turn into three. Well, I'm down to see. Cause I make it so easy to fall in love So come give me a call And we'll fall into love I'm a perfect mix of Saturday night and the rest of your life Anyone with a heart would agree It's so easy to fall in love with me
