20251222 133420 We go in places on all the biggest stages We on the road to greatness, y'all In one, two, three, hey I don't need no traffic jam I don't need traffic jam Right down in the traffic jam We go in a ceiling, darling In tongues going nowhere Like we ain't leaving this place. We ain't goin' nowhere, we not leaving this place. Hey, anybody fix? Tell them fly over, we jammin' all on the shoulder. Y'all listenin', movin' closer, send your bumper right over.
