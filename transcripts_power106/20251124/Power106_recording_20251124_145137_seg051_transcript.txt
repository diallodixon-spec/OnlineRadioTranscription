get the tenant out, meaning you can go to court and file an action, take out a summons for what we call recovery of possession. So you go to court, fill out the requisite paperwork, the court bailiff or you can have someone do it for you will serve the tenant, advising them of the court dates, then you'll go to court. Usually when you go to court, the first hearing is largely up to the discretion of the judge. You know, some judges may say, all right, give them some more time, give them 30 days, give them 60 days. Some judges will say, no, the notice expired a long time ago, too much time has passed. You need to be out of the property ASAP or you know within three days within a week etc so that's generally what can happen but once a notice expires you can now go to court to take out an order take out a claim I should say for recovery of possession
