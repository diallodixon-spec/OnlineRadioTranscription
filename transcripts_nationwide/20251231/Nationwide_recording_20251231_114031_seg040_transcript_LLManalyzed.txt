20251231 114031 last five years. Mm. Yeah. Intently listening to him, yes. And seeing what he has been able to do and what he's trying to do. I just wish the minds of the people would understand it's not about politics. Where do we want to go as a country? Mm hmm. And not be so skeptic. I think the people are very skeptic. Like myself thinking that governments can't change but I think he really has the mind to change. Like me, he's from an average Jamaican family who understands the issues. He said he was a debater and he has been seeing these issues since he was in high school. He probably was complaining about them since then. So, he really has a mind to want to change them. What about his tenure, his prime ministerial tenure so far that has impressed you the most? You know, his ability to be very diplomatic and to connect Jamaica to the world. I think he's really been able to change what Jamaica looks like and what Jamaica is to the world. His representation has been impeccable.
