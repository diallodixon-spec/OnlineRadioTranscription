Make a start in my life. Me, I watch, we're eating on my side. Outfit, take care of me and mine. No off, no turns, and no cross-cast fire. No, no, I'm just how I move. I'm just a walk and I move. Gonna make me rock and groove. Boy, no, no, I miss how I move. Just a walk and I go through. Gonna make rock and groove. Rock and groove.
