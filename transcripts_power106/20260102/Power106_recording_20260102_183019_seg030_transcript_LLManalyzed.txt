20260102 183019 because so much of the World Cup is going to be played in conditions of extreme heat. Will it be too much? Will they have to put more men in midfield and cover up a little bit more? Can they play with all this attacking talent up front? Well, defences will not relish facing Vinny Junior, Rodrigo, Jafinha, Mateus Cunha, Estevan. There's a lot of talent there. Defences won't relish playing that, but also it's not easy to balance a side with so much attacking talent in conditions of extreme heat. Can they do it? I think we're going to have a6 FM. The time is now 6.30. Get ready for action coming to power 106 FM soon.
