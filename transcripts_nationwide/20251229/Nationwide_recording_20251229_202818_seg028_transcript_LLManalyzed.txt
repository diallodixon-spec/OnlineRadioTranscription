20251229 202818 I can catch the moon in my head. Don't you know who I am? Remember my name. I'm gonna live forever. I'm gonna learn how to fly. I feel it coming together. People will see me and cry. I'm gonna make it it to heaven Light up the sky like a flame I'm gonna live forever Baby remember my name Remember, remember, remember, remember Gloria, you're always on the run now
