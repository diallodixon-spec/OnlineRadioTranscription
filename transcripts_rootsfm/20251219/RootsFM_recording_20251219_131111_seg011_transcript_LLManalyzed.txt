20251219 131111 When men drunk our blood like if it's the dry Put us in misery, it was such a good time Come on, the rubbish now our home as flesh Took us to a land of darkness Now we have seen the light, let us all unite And redevelop Africa And reclaim Africa And liberate Africa Black people stop turning food over diamonds, gold and silver, come on Cause we have that tabon land in Africa. Yeah. Stop hating each other. Love one another. And things will be better.
