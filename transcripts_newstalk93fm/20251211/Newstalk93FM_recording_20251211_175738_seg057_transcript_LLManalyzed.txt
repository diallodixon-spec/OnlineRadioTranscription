2025-12-12 11:51:25 I see things out of order and I can't stand it Some can't find a penis, that is so tragic But don't bring your brother down, that's how bad I'll be Leave your sister in a piece, please stop it Trust me, try your best But you're not getting out my head I'm just a ease and all I'm is Yeah, I'm just a all I'm is I'm just a live my life Me, I'll watch you eatin' on my side I'll feed, take care of me and mine Don't have no time for no gas gas fire No, no, it's how I move I'm just a walkin' in the mood Gonna make me rock and move Oh, no, no, this how I can move, can make me rock and groove. Oh, none now is how I move, but just how I can go through, can make me, rock and groove. Yeah, I said we groove.
