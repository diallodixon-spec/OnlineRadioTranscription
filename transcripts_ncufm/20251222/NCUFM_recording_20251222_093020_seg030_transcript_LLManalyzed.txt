20251222 093020 NCU-FM Calling the unknown approaching vessel. You are on a collision course with us. Please change your course 15 degrees to the south to avoid a collision. Recommend you change your course, 15 degrees to the north to avoid collision. When we are told to change course, we have a choice to make. Do we change or continue on the same path? Jesus gave us a choice to make when he said, you are from below, I am from above. If you do not believe that I am the one I claim to be, you will indeed die in your sins. Sir, we could change course here. We have the right of way. I am not changing our course. Unknown vessel, this is an aircraft carrier. We are a large warship. Divert your course now.
