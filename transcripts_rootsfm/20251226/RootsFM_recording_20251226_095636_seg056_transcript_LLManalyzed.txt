20251226 095636 I'll put a string of pearls right in your hand Make love on a beach of jet black sand Outside in the rain We can do it all night I'll touch all the places he would not And some he never knew would get you high Nothing is forbidden when we touch When we turn Every little thing I'll do them for you.
