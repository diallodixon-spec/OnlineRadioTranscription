20260102 132217 Not the sky, not chance, but truth is I'm not lucky, I'm loved I'm not lucky I'm loved Today I'm in a happy place And I know it didn't happen by mistake I love how he wrote my life And I love how he sees my heart So I fall to my knees and I say that I'm grateful When every morning starts So I don't thank my lucky stars Cause that's not where my blessings are Where they come from, the Father's heart Not the sky, not a chance, but truth is I'm not lucky in love Yeah, I'm not luck in love
