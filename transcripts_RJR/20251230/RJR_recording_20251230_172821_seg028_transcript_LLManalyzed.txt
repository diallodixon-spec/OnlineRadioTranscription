20251230 172821 good evening to all the listeners and good evening Dionne and you know I have been listening and it's interesting that that statement was made and with regards to the fact is that the church has millions of dollars and that we should have been involved in the billions in billions of dollars and we should have been engaged in the relief effort. As I'm sure my colleague Bishop Albin will share that from day one the church has been engaged and instrumental in going out to the corners of all the devastated areas in terms of giving relief and physically ensuring that buildings have already begun to be rebuilt. And we can share that a little later on.
