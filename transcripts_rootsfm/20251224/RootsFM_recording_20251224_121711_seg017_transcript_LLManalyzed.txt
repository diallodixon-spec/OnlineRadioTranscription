20251224 121711 filled with holy sorrow. Holy sorrow is an act of love and is the appropriate Christian response to persecution and injustice. Too often, however, our response is not holy but anger. The problem with this is that the reaction and the response is unholy and does not accomplish anything good. It does not help us to imitate Jesus. And it doesn't help us and help those with whom we are angry with. Through the passion of anger, we can use a lot of time and energy. It becomes sin when it is selfish and a reaction of injustice done to us. Instead of this anger, seek to foster holy sorrow.
