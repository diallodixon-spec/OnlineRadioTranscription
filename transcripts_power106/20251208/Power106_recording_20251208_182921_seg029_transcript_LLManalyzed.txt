Yeah, I think it's always important to look in areas where you can improve the squad, but I think we're not just adding bodies now. I think it's one or two players that we're looking to bring in just because of quality and skill set. More importantly, something that we don't currently have in the squad, but we have a really good balance of young players and experienced players in particular positions that meet the profiles that we're looking for. And so, you know, that last 18 months is what we spent a lot of time deliberate, you know, looking for those sort of particular players you can come in so that we can plug and play regardless of the position or regardless of the personnel. That position, someone can come into that position and do a job. Again, slightly different skill sets, but they know what's required in that position, specifically whether it be a midfielder, fullback, or forward roll, they know what is required.
