20260101 111309 Sweetest touch I'm so happy you came in my life Cause you know how to give me that You know how to pull me back When I go running, running Trying to get away from nothing yet You know how to love me hard I want that I'm falling hard I'm falling for you But there's nothing wrong with that You're the one that I think of when I wake You are the one, so I make sure I behave My love is your love, your love is my love You're the one that I dream of when I wake
