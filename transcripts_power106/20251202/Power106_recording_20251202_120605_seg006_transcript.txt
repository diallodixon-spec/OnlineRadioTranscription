A district constable who is charged in relation to the physical assault of a woman while she held a young child in her arms is to return to the Portland Parish Court on January 27, 2024, in White River District, Portland, while he was off duty. Following an investigation by Indcom, the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions ruled that the District Constable should be charged for the assault of both persons who are known to him. The complainants sought medial attention and were recorded as having injuries and were not considered to be permanent. District Constable Minot is to settle his legal representation by the next court date. Disclosure is to also be made at that time, and a trial date to be set. Since January 2024, 53 law enforcement officers have been arrested.
