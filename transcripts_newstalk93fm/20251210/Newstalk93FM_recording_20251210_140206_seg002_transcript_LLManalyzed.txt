============================================================

Like yourself, like yourself, like yourself You know I'm up to wide So don't come and try to interrupt me vibe Even if I went down rude with a next man You will have to get no shade See, the thing that's happened when we party hard I ain't trying to stop you from your plan at all Look at Bumper, are you ready to jam? Are you looking for a gal? You do what you want So when you're ready, you could travel for who you want and love, but why not for who I like it? And if you feel too white on me vibe, so don't say
