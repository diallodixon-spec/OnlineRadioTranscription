than trying to isolate a thousand birds that will then all become sick and can potentially impact others. So in poultry operations, it is standard practice to depopulate, bury, burn, incinerate thereafter. In other species, isolation may be the first treatment, strong biosecurity to ensure that it doesn't spread offsite and it certainly doesn't spread to humans and other animals in those locations. So there is some amount of situational determination, but the standard practice within poultry operations is that we depopulate because there is a greater risk of spread, spread amongst the population and spread to other populations.
