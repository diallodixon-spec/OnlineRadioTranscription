20251215 130305 Say this to yourself I will win with tears in my eyes I'll be judged and criticized Only by those who are afraid to try I'm living it for sins and favors We got a shame Don't wait for something greater for me Right now, not later It's for all you've been through I sing to bathe all you been through I say to please sing to bathe Who would bathe? God help! Let's sing to bathe Let it breathe Bathe is not the cheering things
