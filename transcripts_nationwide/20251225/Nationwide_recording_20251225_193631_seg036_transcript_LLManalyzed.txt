20251225 193631 Sometimes a certain smell will take me back to when I was young How come I'm never able to identify where it's coming from? I'd make a candle out of it if I ever found it Tried to sell it, never saw out of it, I probably only saw one It'd be to my brother, cause we have the same nose Same clothes, thrown, thrown as stones, thrown from a creek we used to roam But it would remind us of when nothing really mattered Out of food and loans and treehouse homes, we all would take the ladders Wish we could turn back time To the good old days
