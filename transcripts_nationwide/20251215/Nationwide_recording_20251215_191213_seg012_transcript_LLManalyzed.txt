20251215 191213 Hey girl, what's up? So hold on. Why you look so vexed this early? Did you not just start? Lisa, it is so good to see you. But sorry you catch me like this, girl. My uncle sent one by line when my family go for clarity. You don't want to hear the cries of the people they put on or something. But matters worse, me hear say half of the thing they missing. And me know say her customs. Girl, how you know say her customs? You should stop going like you don't have any sense. You don't see everybody that talks about it in the media? You don't want to stop listening to hearsay? You ever experience that? Customs don't go into your package, suitcase, barrel or cargo unless you ship the item or the agent stand up right there when they inspect it. Listen, customs job is to protect the borders, collect revenue and to facilitate trade. They don't collect or store shipment, they inspect it and somebody has to present it for inspection. So how customs ever get so much custom then?
