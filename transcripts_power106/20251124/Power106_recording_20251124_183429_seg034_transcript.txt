well um the date of december 7th has been agreed uh we believe that a rich race meet as the muti mal will be conducted on the on the 6th of um december and we believe all the race and players are going to be around so it would be a good day for um for people to come after the muti mal people who are enthused and who are dissatisfied by the day of Mutemile. I think people will come out on the day after because some, not minor, but major disruption. What can you tell us about that, being one of the top readers you said? Yes, well, I can tell you, I've toured Orange Valley.
