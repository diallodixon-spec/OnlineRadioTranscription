20251224 205839 Every little child on Santa's knee has room for your love Underneath that tree Give love on Christmas Day No greater gift is there than love The world needs love and the world needs more love Why don't you give love on Christmas day The man on the street and the couple upstairs Only to know there's someone who cares Give love on Christmas day No greater gift is ever lost
