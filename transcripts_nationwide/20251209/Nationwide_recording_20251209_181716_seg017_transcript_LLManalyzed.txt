Vauxhall at the Spanish Town Prison Oval. The win moved the St Catherine Bay School to 6 points and the top of Zone B in the quarter-final round. 1987 champion stats have fought their way back into the reckoning for a semi-final place after spanking Calabar High 4-1 at Stadium East. Marvin Henry was on target twice for the Bumper Hall Bay School with the other goals coming from Justin Johnson and Kenarda Gordon. Stats are now on three points, the same as Vauxhall, and both will meet in a cracking game later this week to decide the other semifinalists from the zone. In the Ducosta Cup, favourite Glenmure tagged last season's beaten finalist McGrath 4-0 and are virtually through to the last four from zone one. In a late Manning Cup game at Stadium East, Jamaica College are leading Charlie Smith 4-0.
