20251216 170807 in the government to resolve outstanding issues with salary increments and contracts for the island's teachers, even as the country grapples with a recovery from Hurricane Melissa. JTA President Mark Malava told the gleaner that notwithstanding all that is happening, the government has to ride and whistle. Mr. Malava revealed that the association submitted two letters dated December 15 to the Minister of Finance requesting the resumption of wage talks. He said the association is disappointed and agitated at how the government is treating the negotiations concerning salaries and conditions of service for the island's teachers. He said the first letter addresses overdue increments in contracts, noting that teachers have been working without a contract since April 2025, the same date when salary adjustments were due. The JTA is demanding that the matters be resolved by January 5, 2026. The second letter requests a meeting with the ministry in early January
