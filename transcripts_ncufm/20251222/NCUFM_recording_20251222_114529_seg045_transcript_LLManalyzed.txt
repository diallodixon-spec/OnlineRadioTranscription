20251222 114529 God, I'm in a few fences Go the extra mile Oh, lend a hand where it's needed Sit and talk for a while Take a stroll on a Sunday Alone, walking apart I'm not gonna miss one thing on the list When it comes to the heights I'm gonna love like you're leaving Give more than I'm gonna love like I'm leaving, give more than I'm receiving, laugh until it makes my breath away. I'll take it away, take it away.
