I reach your heart, you know, but you do not make it just because it's happy be better, not be living at the gate of happy be under the pressure, my friend. And we born in a struggle, isolated in a bubble. We're not feeling rich yet and not feeling poor. God bless and please help us, we can't take no more. We're feeling depression, we way down to the core. Oh, money's in the air when they send it offshore. And every nation come and get rich and we stay poor. Them slow you $20, all over, go through the back door. Tell them, a second, cause we all under pressure, my friend Sometimes when you feel it, you cry it out I wish your heart seen up, but you do not make it stressed out, cause it happy be better not be living at the gate of pity under the pressure, my friend Lord have mercy, this can get no worse, so we call it a curse on me
