20260101 190504 The fears that once controlled me Can't get to me at all It's time to see what I can do To test the limits and break through No light, no role, no rules for me I'm free Let it go, let it go I'm one with the wind and sky Let it go, Let it go You'll never see me cry Here I stand, and here I stay let the storm rage on My power flurries through the air into the ground
