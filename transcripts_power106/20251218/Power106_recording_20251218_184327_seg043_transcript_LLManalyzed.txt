20251218 184327 our MVP, our male MVP of the final and that goes to Wayne Palmer aka Winji and his partner from Bull Bay United and we're also highlighting our female pairs for the season and one of the most consistent female pair for the season and that also will be going to Fluffy and Bashan. Interestingly enough they are from Trelawny so big up up to those ladies, those queens of Domino. They did well. And of course on that day as well we'll be having a match. So we'll be playing a 100 sprint where the champions will be playing at DHA All-Star team where the other six teams who had participated will be sending players to represent the All-Star team and they'll be going up against a champion on the day. So yeah, we're looking for a wonderful evening. Yeah, so it's a party. It's going to be a party. It indeed will be a celebration and that's the aim. After such a wonderful tournament, it's only pleasing for us to close it in Einstein.
