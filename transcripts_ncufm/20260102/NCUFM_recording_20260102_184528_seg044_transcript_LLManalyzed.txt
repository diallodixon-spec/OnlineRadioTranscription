20260102 184528 Trusting in the Father Knowing He'll be with me all the way I'm stepping out in faith Though winds will blow against me I will claim the victory Resting in His all-sufficient grace I'm stepping out, stepping out in faith Oh, I don't have to fear what comes tomorrow Or know exactly what the future holds For the God of all creation goes before me And I can rest assured he's in control So I'll just keep on walking on this journey Following the one who knows the way And though sometimes my faith may start to waver I'll take the leap, I'm stepping out in faith I'm steppin' out in faith
