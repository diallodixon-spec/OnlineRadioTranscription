We never say goodbye We never say goodbye First love never dies We never say goodbye So we'll walk on happy speed See that you're just as beautiful as ever, babe I guess you're still the same as me First love never dies And we never really said goodbye we never really said it to her never really said goodbye first love never dies when i saw you i could hardly speak You're just as beautiful as ever, babe I guess it's still the same street First love never dies
