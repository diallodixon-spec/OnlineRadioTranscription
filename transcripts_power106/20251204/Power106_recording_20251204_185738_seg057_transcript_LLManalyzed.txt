But that's definitely one of the biggest challenges. And to cope with that is quite difficult. There's some tracks that don't suit you and you still have to base. Some tracks, for example, and one of my weaknesses is a high speed corner. So you're not in a circuit car for let's say a month. And then you're back in doing an hour and expected to take a corner at 230 kilometers flat out in six years. So you basically, you don't have any time to be slow and to do it, do it and build up and be progressive. You have to go out there and know that if you want to win, you're going to do it from session one. You're going to go flat out in six year at 230 kilometers and basically use your skill to manage it, you know? So definitely that was one of the biggest challenges for me. All right, Mr. Christopher, you said you get the final word. What have you got to say now to the Jamaican nation now at this time when you have given them such a lift with what happened in Europe and your efforts with the recovery? I mean it to speak.
