I said if you watch what you say to me daughter, cause in the long run, she could be your doctor. Oh, if you mention that to me, son, then I mean a woman, it could worth it on a gun, man. Still you never listen. Your ears must be missing. Every day you say you're gonna shine and not glisten. You're talking through the screen and the lighter and the whistle. It look like you forget all about that blessing. The words not from your mouth. Meditation of your heart should be free from negative. Have every thought. While it's a good call, you better do a good job. Be careful what you inject. What you inject into you, then talk and just watch what you teach your little children.
