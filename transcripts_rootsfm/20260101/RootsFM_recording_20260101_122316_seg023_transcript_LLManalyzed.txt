20260101 122316 Guess I'm on my way Need a new friend And the way I feel now Guess I'll be with you till the end Guess I'm on My way Mighty glad you stayed I'm stuck on you Been a fool too long I guess it's time for me to come on home Guess I'm on my way So hard to see that a woman like you could wait around for a man like me
