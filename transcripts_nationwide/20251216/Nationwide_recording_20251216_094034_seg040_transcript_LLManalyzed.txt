20251216 094034 I went yesterday because of my mother. I went to downtown. The actual downtown. And I am telling you, the customer service is very poor. You go in Spanish town, it's the same thing. And it's not getting better. And if you call a machine you have to talk to, and you ask ask for a live agent, it's still over two hours before somebody attend to you. Sometimes you don't get through none at all. So, before we go any further, which community is... Well, first of all...
