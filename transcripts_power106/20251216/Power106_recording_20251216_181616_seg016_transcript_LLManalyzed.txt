20251216 181616 Okay time to say with us we are having a conversation wonderful with Mrs. Faith Cooks and she is an elite parent and president of the Cayman Islands Netball Association. Now I said elite parent now in this what does that mean in this particular concept? I think you you're probably referring to the accomplishments of my children. As parents, we are really happy for where they are right now in life and the opportunity that we had to raise them. We never started out thinking that they were going to be elite parents. My husband and I are both from a background where we love sports. Him from Karate, coming out of the YMCA in Kingston, Jamaica. I did track and field at Martin Bay High School.
