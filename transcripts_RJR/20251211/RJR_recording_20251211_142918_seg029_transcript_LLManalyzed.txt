Music Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh, lord, no. We can't afford to lose. They will, we'll always be done. Don't they know? They will, will always be done. See, on this journey, where you put me, will you put things to my weakness? Negative thoughts and non-pirate, I play with like a sickness. Now, the youth, them have a hit list. On every stall and most business, helicopters areters a circle round it, you like a frisbee And Salmi's trimmer that can't find picnic Message in the music is the only way fi fix it I say work, sound power lift ya on up if you with me Now go make dem trick we got but not repeat the history I say work
