20251218 131910 To you I'm just another friend And all the time I thought that I was lost But looking back I can see How I let my heart fool me I guess I never meant that much to you Here I am, here I stand You see me with my heart in hand Knowing that there's nothing I can do It looks like I fooled myself again. But you know I'm a fool for you. It looks like I've fooled myself again.
