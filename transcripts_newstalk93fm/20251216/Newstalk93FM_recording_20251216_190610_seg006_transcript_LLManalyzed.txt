20251216 190610 Am I wrong for thinking out the box from where I stay? Am I wrong for saying that I choose another way? I ain't trying to do what everybody else doing just because everybody doing what they all do. If one thing I know, I fall but I grow I'm walking down this road of mine, this road that I go home So am I wrong for thinking that we could be something for real? No, am I wrong for trying to reach the things that I can't see. But that's just how I feel. That's just how I'll feel. That's how I'll feel, trying to reach to things that I can see.
