If you fall in love, kill is certain. You go to a breakfast, I'm not capping. Can you see drip pool, I'm not catching. I'm not faking this, not take I'm serious I did do touch speed. No need to resonate I'm on a different frequency. I don't think it's necessary. I'll be down with just somebody that could do like me When I be like Mo Salah coming up the right wing I'll call to your defender, you don't need to tell me I'm a finesse You don't see me, I'm a snitch You can let me carry you
