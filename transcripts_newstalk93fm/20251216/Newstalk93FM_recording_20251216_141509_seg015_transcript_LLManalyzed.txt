20251216 141509 What we gonna do now? Start a wine on it. I say compromise on it. Baby, spend time on it. I said compromise on it. Can we talk some business? You know I want your company. And it's nothing too risky. Limited liability. Don't worry. If you try all the things I like, you could still be shy in the morning So don't feel away You don't like the fast life But look on the bright side girl I go take the blame I just want you come and light it up Just a little whine then I'll say Come and meet me at the end of the truck and we rev it up. Say, hold it. Keep throwing it back at the way you stopped us up. Baby, no way. We could post up all the pictures you want when you're ready. I could overshare knowledge. You could overshare.
