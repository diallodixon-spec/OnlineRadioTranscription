20251216 144433 I love the way you hold me in Your arms at nights and with words that melt me inside Oh my, and when you touch my face Your fingers grip my wings and tip me You pull my lips on your chocolate brown skin I'm so excited Can't hide it, can't hide it It's a crazy night Like a baby to sweet candy I'm addicted So give me some love Another morning
