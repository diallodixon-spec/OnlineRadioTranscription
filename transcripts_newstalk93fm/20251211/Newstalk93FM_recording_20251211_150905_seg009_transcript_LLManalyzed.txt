2025-12-12 08:52:23 Tell them, are you leaving? Right there, sleeping. They don't want me, they don't want me. Until my head's gone and I'm miserable. All the money grown, I'm causing trouble. Look how these security watch me. They don't know I'm out there. I just must have been placed on a deep track a jumbie I don't wait They don't want me in there, but I see them They don't want because I do I don't wait I don't listen to nothing they say Every fat ass drunk, jumping up, Jumpin' up Tell them I ain't livin' Right there sleepin' Every breath I drink
