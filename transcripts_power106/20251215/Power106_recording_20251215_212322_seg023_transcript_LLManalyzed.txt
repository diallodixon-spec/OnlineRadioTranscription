20251215 212322 Huh? I'm hearing you, so I don't know. We don't see them in the Lakovia area where I live. So they pass, they pass every day. But we haven't heard that help is coming that way. Where are the people getting help from? Pardon? Where are these people getting help from, the people in your area? Who can top buying materials, things, board, whatever, lumber, steel, who can afford it, but who can't? They're left in the wild. So we're begging for help.
