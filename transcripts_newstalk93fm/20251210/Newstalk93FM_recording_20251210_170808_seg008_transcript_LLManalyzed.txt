Baby, I still call to you. I'm sticking around as long as I'm breathing. You know I'm not leaving. Still call to you. Baby, I still called to you. Magnet. Your bad, your bad, your bad. Magnet. I have the eyes of an angel. I have you on my brain stem. Reminiscing of them things that. And if I get you with nothing, I won't give. My girl, you a body, you a body with a body, oh, you're bad, sir. Any time you call, we'll answer. My girl, you a body, you a body. Whether body or your bad, sir. Anytime you call we'll answer. Because if after wine I call, we just leave it. I stay in all evening. Stay come to you.
