20251222 180704 But I thank you always Loving me Now I know there were days I'd look at myself I felt like less of a person compared to everyone else What about this flaw too big too small can I exchange? And trying to make up for what I felt short, I let some slip away. But when I look in the mirror and don't like what I see, oh, I just think you're always loving me. And I know I get bad, but you wait patiently. I want to thank you. For always loving me. Oh, I just thank you.
