20251217 103122 here at New Start 93 FM. We're concluding an interview with Mr. Paul Buchanan as it relates to he taking... Let's get straight to it. Yes, so Mr. Buchanan... George Davis, who turned the things around, George Davis, a candidate, leading the prime minister with 15 boxes to go. He's anticipating the Mullines division votes only to find that they are not coming. Mullines is the strongest division for the PMP. Never in its history, not since adult suffrage, the votes recorded on election night has been recorded in any election, 2,000 votes. My canvas showed 6,700 votes out of the 13,400. We learn in evidence, not rebutted, because he's talking about frivolity.
