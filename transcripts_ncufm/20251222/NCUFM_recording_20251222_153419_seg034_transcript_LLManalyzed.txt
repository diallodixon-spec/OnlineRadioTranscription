20251222 153419 have a fever or some fatigue in some cases. You know, they say prevention is always better than cure. And how does this fare when it comes onto a sore throat? Well, it's pretty simple. You have to stay hydrated. Drink plenty of warm fluids like your herbal teas, your warm water with honey and lemon, or clear soups to keep the throat moist. Also, what I do recommend is some sorrel. Not necessarily with a bag of ginger or anything, but you can draw the sorrel and have it just like that straight out of the pot. You can have it warm. It's actually really, really, really good. It's not as sweet, but it's really good and definitely good for you. So if you're able to have access to some sorrel, yeah man, have some sorrel man.
