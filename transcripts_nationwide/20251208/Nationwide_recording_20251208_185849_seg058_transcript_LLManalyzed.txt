It sounds like they're in silos and people and some of your listeners don't often understand the impact of what tourism means for our economy. Tourism represents 34% of our GDP. It also represents 78% of our foreign direct investment up to 2024. It employs one in four of every employed person in the country, which means 25% of our employee stock is employed in tourism. And it represents 2.3 billion US dollars of earnings per annum. So we have a great responsibility to the economy of Jamaica, and we start in the economy of Jamaica to ensure that we not only bring the industry back but that we bring the industry back in a responsible and a sustainable way to ensure that our economy can continue to rise forward but most importantly can be sustained going forward.
