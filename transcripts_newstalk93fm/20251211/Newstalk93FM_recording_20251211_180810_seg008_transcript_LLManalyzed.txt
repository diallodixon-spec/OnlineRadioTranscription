2025-12-12 12:03:27 Turn the lights on Every night I rush to my bed With hopes that maybe I'll get a chance To see you when I close my eyes I'm moving out of my head Lost in a fairytale Can you hold my hands and be hope it rains You're the perfect lullaby What kind of dream is this? You can be a sweet dream Or a beautiful nightmare Be the way I eat Don't wanna wake up I'm your sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare Somebody pinch me, your love's too good to be true My guilty pleasure, I ain't going nowhere Baby, long as you're here, I'll be floating on air Cause you're my sweet dream or beautiful nightmare
