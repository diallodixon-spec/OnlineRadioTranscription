Alright, as I started this morning, I want to once again ask all Jamaicans to pray for a man who served Jamaica very, very much, Garth Hanna. He's in Descendants Bay Hospital, a former police officer. On behalf of my producer, Tanya Richards, let me say thanks to St. Barnswell who joined us and stick and stay with us. Alright, until Monday when you join me god bless you in the next one.
