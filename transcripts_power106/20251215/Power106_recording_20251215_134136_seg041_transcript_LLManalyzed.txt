20251215 134136 Corruption in Haiti, I can tell you this, Haiti is not the only country that is corrupt. That is not Haiti's major crisis. Haiti's major crisis is that the people outside of Haiti, starting with France, you know, I don't know. Can you just go read up on Haiti? Let me move on to the other text because people may not know that Haiti actually had to pay for their independence. You pay for your independence? After the United States won the war against Britain and became independent in 1776, right? Use them paying taxes to England because they're independent? Why is it that nobody seems to know the history of Haiti? Everybody just seems to be critical of Haiti. And I'm not finding excuses for Haiti. Nor am I finding excuses for the successive governments in Jamaica that have been corrupt and waste resources.
