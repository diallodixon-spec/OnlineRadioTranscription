I can only try to bring love back in line But something in your eyes says I'm running out of time I would call you on the phone just to hear you say Honey, I love you always Oh, I miss those days Now I feel no more alone Baby, where did we go wrong? Tell me that love is here No, it hasn't disappeared I'm still in love with? Like the way you used to be? Or did it all fade away? And the hurt I feel, is it here to stay? Are you still loving me?
