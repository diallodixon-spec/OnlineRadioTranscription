20251230 143021 The time by Lascaux Microfinance is... And the time is 2.30 on the Big 94. And I have a very special message from JPS. This is a public service announcement from the JPS. JPS is urging motorists to slow down when approaching JPS work sites, obey all warning signs and traffic instructions, and give crews the space they need to work safely. By doing so, motorists help protect lives and support the work being done to restore and maintain electricity across the island. Slow down, move with care, help everyone get home safely. JPS, rebuilding together, powering what matters. That was a public service announcement from JPS. I'm not allowed to go anywhere by myself. They're afraid I will escape. See how my other face brews up? That beat me just because I'm so tired.
