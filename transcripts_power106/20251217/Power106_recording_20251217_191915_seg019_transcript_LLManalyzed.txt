20251217 191915 The maker celebrating his first ever European Drivers Championship victory after Senna Summerbell and Christopher Issa captured the TCR European Endurance Championship DSG class title at the Misano World Circuit. All right, not only did they win their class, but they finished second overall in a field that included faster SE2 cars, a performance that stunned Europe and put Jamaica firmly on the international motorsport map. But the story doesn't end there. It goes far beyond racing. So let's get into it. First of all, we say, could we make Mr. Christopher Issa who I want to power. He was my former boss. So Christopher, good evening. Welcome to Power Play. Yeah, good evening, Chris. Good evening. Certainly very happy to have you over. Send us a mobile. Send us. Good evening. Hi, how are you doing? How are you doing? Oh, great. Thank you for having us.
