20251226 181108 Look out for the reprisal, we used to couldn't find the cabbage for the rice, never had nothing close, made off a gamble with my life, yeah. Me been a brine like semi-broke, me take a minus, me a plus, them devil know when me go through them, see me shine and say hello. Have a drive like me a truck, brother my life me a froth, me a **** like me a ****, all day, all night, me a walk. Had the right night, had the right vibe, me life, life to sell. All the hype out, I do what number I try, I impress up. Y'all a march out, had the same thing, me a talk bout, me a get high, me a pass. Got some more vibes for ya. We don't know. Where's that big up?
