Once again One more time By myself No one said it was easy So random Heart eclipsed on inside And who is the one you're clinging to Instead of me tonight? And where are you now? Now that I need you Tears on my pillow Wherever you go I'd cry me a river That leads to your ocean You'll never see me fall apart In the words of a broken heart
