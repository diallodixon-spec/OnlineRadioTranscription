2025-12-12 12:16:29 Yes. Wow, so before you went, what led you into the hospital? I am a diabetic. And that led you to losing the leg, yeah? Yeah. And since you lost the leg, where were you living before you were admitted in the hospital? I was living with some friends, but after I entered the hospital, they tear down the house that they gave me to live in. So you don't even have a little piece of land anywhere then? No, but you know if I can move about I will find myself some help somewhere. Because I will, you know, I will go and ask. And you are what age now Mrs. Spencer? How old are you now? March coming I will be double six.
