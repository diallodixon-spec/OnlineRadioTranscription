20251231 103819 You know enough to stop listening to hearsay? You ever experience that? Customs don't go into your package, suitcase, barrel or cargo unless you will ship the item or the agent stand up right there when they inspect it. Listen, customs job is to protect the borders, collect revenue and to facilitate trade. They don't collect or store shipment, they inspect it. And somebody else represents it for inspection. Tracy, and the customs are alone involved in the clearance process, you know? Even though it's them we tend to talk about. Look at it this way. Shipment delayed, talk to your airline agent. Missing items, talk to your freight forwarder. The charges surprise you now. Call customs. But remember to collect your sign and stamp declaration or C number from your agent. So when you call customs, them can better help you. We're never too old for learning.
