============================================================

lot is going on and I look forward to seeing all of you so we can try and settle you down as nicely as possible for Christmas 2025. I'm heading back over to Mr Philip Polwell and Senator Marlon Morgan to continue the discussion on the JPS loan because we had to end abruptly. Can I thank you both for rejoining me? Yeah, you're welcome. Great to be back. Yes. I think I was on the floor. Well, you you wish to have it go right ahead, Mr. Paul. Well, and tell me where you left off. Yes, because I was just about to say we just got breaking news from the senator and I'm I'm just wondering how appropriate it is for him to really provide that clarification when, in the lower house, we're seeking to get definitively from the Minister of Energy whether or not the government's 150 million would have been matched by another 150 million.
