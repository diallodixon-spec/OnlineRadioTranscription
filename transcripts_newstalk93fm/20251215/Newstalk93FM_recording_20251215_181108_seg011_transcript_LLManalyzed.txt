20251215 181108 I feel I could take a dance with a lover And you never let me wrong But everywhere I look now is pressure So give me something to ease my soul Cause we need a healing And when you check the situation From since our small eyes are so common Perfect for feeling When you need some motivation This thing could ring from the rain and the thunder You'll see when they soak up calling They give me powers to jam till morning It's for a broken heart and somebody I can't wait, I can't wait for the jump to jump in as a show. Make my way, make my way to the end.
