We're alone again, every moment's golden, yeah. Feelings I've been holding in, it must be love. Whenever I'm broken, you make me feel whole. Whenever I'm lonely, you're there for my soul wherever you are girl that's why I call my own whenever you doubt it I'll be letting you know oh girl I want to be dancing with you forever
