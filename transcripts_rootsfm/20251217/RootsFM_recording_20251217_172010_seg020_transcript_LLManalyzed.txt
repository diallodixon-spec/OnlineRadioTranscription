20251217 172010 On the international scene, prosecutors in Los Angeles have charged Nick Rayner, the son of Hollywood director Rob Rainer, and his wife Michelle, with two counts of first-degree murder following the deaths of his parents. District Attorney Nathan Hotchman says the 32-year-old is facing charges that include a special circumstance alleging multiple murders. If convicted, Rainer could face life imprisonment without the possibility of parole or the death penalty. Prosecutors say a final decision on whether they seek the death penalty has not yet been made. The charges come two days after Rob Rainer and his wife Michelle were found dead.
