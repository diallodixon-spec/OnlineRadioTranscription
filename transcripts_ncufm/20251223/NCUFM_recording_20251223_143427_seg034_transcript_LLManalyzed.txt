20251223 143427 Monday through to Friday in the PM. I want to say good afternoon to everyone who's tuned in to NCUFM, everyone who is in my WhatsApp line. Sending blessings to Claudette Peart, Auntie Maxine Anderson, Marylee Holmes, Roxanne Brown-Jones, good afternoon to you, Annette Silvera, Auntie Marcia, Auntie Sharon, blessings to you, Sister Joyce Miller. I love how Jesus always wants to be your friend. As a matter of fact, I have this next song coming up by Take Six to really help flesh out what he means.
