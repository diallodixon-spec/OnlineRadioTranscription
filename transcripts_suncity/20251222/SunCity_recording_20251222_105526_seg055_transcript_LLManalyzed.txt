20251222 105526 You better watch out, I'm telling you why Santa Claus is coming to town. I'm dreaming of a black eyed Christmas Red off the red nose reindeer All the bears shining down Not true, how you know? They say Adam and Eve went up my sleeve They never come down until they feel the breeze Me say that Christmas breeze Me say no bother starts peace Me say that Christmas breeze I say you come from the peace and then you come from the risk. I say the Christmas breeze. Cause I say Christmas come but once a year. I say no leaving and no fear. Have faith.
