It doesn't give your husband any automatic right to the property. So, I mean, think about it this way. Let us say you have your matrimony home and it is in the wife's name alone. Let's say she doesn't even change her name on the title. So let's say her married name is Smith, but she keeps her maiden name of Jones. It doesn't matter what name is on the title. Once it's the host that she uses as her matrimonial home, her husband is entitled to a 50% share of the property, whether his name is on the type or not, whether she changes her name on the title to her married name or not.
