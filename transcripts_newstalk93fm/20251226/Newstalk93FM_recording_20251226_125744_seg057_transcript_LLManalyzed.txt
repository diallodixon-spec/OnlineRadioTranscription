20251226 125744 I do not accept your apology Just let me be, just let me free Give me love, space, step back, let me breathe Give you the cold shoulder, I really hope you free Until you burn, almost had me burnt buried Turned you to a brother, ain't tryna get married Wanna trap me cause the money unheard Bring you to a god that I'm not soon buried Piss me off, you're too suspicious Too ridiculous, you know, and then you miss my home touch. Hello. Hello. Do my do my thing. Next. Excellent.
