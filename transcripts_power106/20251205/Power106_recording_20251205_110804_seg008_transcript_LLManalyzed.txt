who was in Jamaica yesterday. Nobody didn't know. I don't know if it's for security reasons or what. But I promise you, when Clinton leaves America, because I'm sure he still has a security detail, everybody has to know. I remember him functioning in a private capacity now. Right, because of the Clinton Foundation. We'll comment on that in just a moment. Not that time I did be down, but reality is reality. So apparently, according to the newspaper report, Clinton was in Jamaica on Thursday and was taken by Energy Minister Darvaz to view damage by Hurricane Melissa in an effort to generate more support for the island. Now, that means they would have gone up in the air, presumably, unless the damage, it just can't go inside or something. Must have been.
