20251226 142313 Good, good, so good tonight Ooh baby, ooh baby Tonight is the night Come take my hand And whisper your desire Your wish is my command We lit the spark And now the flames gone higher Ecstasy in the dark But there's a better way to show you how I miss you Nothing I would rather do You've been waiting long and now it's much too strong We better be getting It's my love you desire take me home
