20251212 190906 I'm Camille Williams with Beyond the Headlines. Thank you so much for staying with us. It's time now for our international story. Solutions for a more respectful society are being explored globally, focusing on empathy and media literacy. In Botswana, the charity ThinkEqual helps primary school teachers prioritize empathy, while in East London, teenagers are learning to interpret online information to fight misinformation and polarization. Mara Anubi presents for BBC's program, People Fixing the World. Conflicts, protests, online trolls. The world is so polarized. Sadly, I don't have a one-size-fits-all solution for this, but some people have suggested that one way of having lasting change is by teaching children empathy, getting them to understand people's feelings and different points of views so that when they're older, they're already more accepting of others.
