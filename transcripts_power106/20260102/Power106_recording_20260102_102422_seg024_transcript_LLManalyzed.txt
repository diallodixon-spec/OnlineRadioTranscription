20260102 102422 So I am not seeing where they are looking at to give us this number. And I am baffled at what is going on, because we still see the high cost of energy. We still see we're doing business index is still high, and we do not see how the recovery has moved us to the 5.1% in the third quarter. So I am not to question what is going on with the person who are giving us all of this data because the data has to be so correlated that all other factors have to be interdependent enough for us to go so we can see the movement. And I am not seeing it at all. And I have to look at the second quarter now.
