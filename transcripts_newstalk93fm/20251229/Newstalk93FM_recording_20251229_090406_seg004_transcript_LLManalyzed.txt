20251229 090406 So pray for me If I don't come home in the morning Just know that I say it's not in my place But this mass have a hold on me I can't leave Until every single button down If anyone look it for me then You can find me wherever I'm shaking Higher beating, ready to walk Just the one time to feel Can't ever let me go To send a search party to find me I'll out on the road and line me Tell them that is who I have made They can never see me when I say To send a search for me to find me I'm not coming home tonight
