We therefore formally requested the international community, including the IMF, the World Bank, bilateral development partners, climate finance platforms and multilateral development banks, to assemble a reconstruction support package that scales with Jamaica's ambitions and needs. Prime Minister Dr Andrew Holness. For a small island developing state like Jamaica, access to such a forum is invaluable. This was only the second time Jamaica has ever been invited to the G20. This was an opportunity the government felt it could not ignore. The mission was carefully considered, debated, and ultimately embraced because of what was at stake, which was our country's ability to rebuild swiftly and sustainably. The measure of the recovery is not going to be in how fast you deliver the package of food. The measure of recovery is going to be how fast you return electricity and water. How you kept the population safe from diseases.
