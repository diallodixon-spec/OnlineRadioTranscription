You don't see everybody talking about it in the media. You don't want to stop listening to hearsay. Have you ever experienced that? Customs don't go into your package, suitcase, barrel or cargo unless you ship the item or the agent stand up right there when they might inspect it listen Customs job is to protect the borders collect revenue and the facility traded them not collect or store Shipment them inspect it and somebody after presented for inspection. Eh, so how customs ever get so much custom then Tracy and the customs alone involved in the clearance clearance process, even though it's them we tend to talk about. Look at it this way. Shipment delayed, talk to your airline agent. Missing items, talk to your freight forwarder. The charges surprise you now. Call customs.
