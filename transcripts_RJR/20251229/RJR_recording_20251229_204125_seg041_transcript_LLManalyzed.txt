20251229 204125 Say it is untrue And don't it make my brown eyes blue Tell me no secrets, tell me some lies Give me no reasons, give me alibis Tell me you love me and don't make me cry Say anything but don't say goodbye I didn't mean to treat you bad I didn't know just what I had. But honey, now I do. And don't it make my brown eyes, don't make my brown eyes blue.
