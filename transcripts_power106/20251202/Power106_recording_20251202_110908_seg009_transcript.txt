============================================================

Love is life where dreams come true And even though I get heavy youth, baby Desires like these are true for you All my love is all I have And my dreams are very special All my life I looked for you And today my dreams come true You need me and I need you Love and us is very special Things you seem to do divine You look straight into eyes. I know what love was meant to be. Because I'm so tenderly. Love is life and life is living. It's very special.
