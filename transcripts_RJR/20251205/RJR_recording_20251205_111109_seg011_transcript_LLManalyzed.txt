a page out of my book because the world would be quite boring if they share the same views as I do. But such is the beauty of the world in which we live. We can all experience the same conditions and just hold different views. I don't think them to be any less thoughtful in their approach even though the views are different. As it stands now, this group of which I am a part seems to have a completely different view from the one I hold. The Press Association of Jamaica has a completely different view than the one I hold, but I maintain the right to have the view I hold and not only the right to have it, but to express it and to express it in the ways that I have done for all of the reasons I have done because especially at a time like this it is important for people who hold different views.
