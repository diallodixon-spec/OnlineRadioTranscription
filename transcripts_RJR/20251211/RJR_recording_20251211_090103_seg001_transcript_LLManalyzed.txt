NHF is now 9 o'clock. Good morning. In the headline news at this hour, the major organized crime and anti-corruption agency supported by members of the Jamaica Constabulary Force has arrested four suspects in connection with an investigation into a smishing fraud at the National Commercial Bank. The four who are accused of stealing over 18 million Jamaican dollars through phishing, smishing and vishing attacks between April 2022 and December 2023 are alleged to have defrauded eight NCB account holders by transferring the funds to 23 beneficiaries.
