20251229 091712 I'm not your companion or your man standing. Hit me when you want to get rammed in. I be scrambling with lots of monsters. Shot for lots of cops and robbers. Mixing every block that's blocked up. But she like the way I diddy bop. You peep that. Mayborn, Maury Ticks, plus Chanel ski hat. She want her, but don't want to give her the. Now she's screaming out. Yeah, she's playing with herself, can't dig it out Lift her up, my eyes just a-yo, get it out Don't wanna sound full of myself-a-roo But you ain't lookin' at no other dudes Cause you love me So you think about a chance You find yourself tryin' to do my dance Maybe cause you love me
