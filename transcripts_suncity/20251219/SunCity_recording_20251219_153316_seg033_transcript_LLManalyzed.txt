And then tune in each and every Tuesday and see if you made the play. If we get great feedback, then you could be featured on the Stun City 104.9 FM playlist. Artists, producers, are you ready? Then submit your music. We are waiting. Take away yourself from trouble, take away yourself from trouble. I'm coming, I'm coming. Take away myself from trouble. Still I see I done certain kind. Don't think no sweet like the gift of life. Walk away from trouble, stay away from trouble.
