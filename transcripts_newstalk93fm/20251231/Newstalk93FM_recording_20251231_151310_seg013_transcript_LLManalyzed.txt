20251231 151310 Only you can help me understand it You and you alone speak my language And I try my best to keep my head up Every day I get stronger and stronger I feel it If you come here tonight and want good time, let good time in the place. Stress on me mind and I need somewhere to release it. So DJ turn up the music, let me feel nice. Somebody say oh nana. We don't want the stress no more. I got the remedy you been looking for. Tell not the bad mind.
