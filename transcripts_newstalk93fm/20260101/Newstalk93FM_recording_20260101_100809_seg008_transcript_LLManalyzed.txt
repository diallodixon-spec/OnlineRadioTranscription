20260101 100809 And even though the waves are rough, this love is tough. Just love me. Deep as the blue sea, deep as the blue sea. Love me really and truly. And even though the storms will come, no, we won't run. Just love is deeper than the blue sea I've seen many but I still pick you just like a fruit tree Look in my eyes, what do you see? I see happiness Me and you are kickin' like Bruce Lee Baby girl, me want you pray this One day without your lovin' and the rasta get seasick Not even Viva when me sick and ill is Lovin' what you give me, complete this and need it Jesus, as the blue sea, your love's flowin' into me And even though the waves are rough, this love is tough Just love me, deep as the blue sea
