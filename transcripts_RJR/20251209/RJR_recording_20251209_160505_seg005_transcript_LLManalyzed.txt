We appreciate it. We appreciate it. When you're gone, when we're missing Tryin' proper workin' hard on the roadside And when they pay a gun, them a come bandin' both sides of the road But them still have the support pipe A one card, me a spin, number down pay a gun Slash me up on one deck, man, fi clown, what fi clown? Must come back around
