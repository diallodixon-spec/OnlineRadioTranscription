20251225 110907 has come through the birth of this lowly king. It's a message for a broken world, and a timeless reminder for generations to come, that there is one who came to love and redeem us. There is one, who came to seek us out, to heal, to restore, and to love us completely. From us here at Array to Jamaica, 94 FM, we wish you a happy, blessed, and truly holy Christmas, active for the good of our nation. Let us be mindful of one another, offering grace where it is needed and joy where it can be shared, especially as our nation continues to carefully and courageously weave its path along the road to recovery. Merry Christmas, everybody.
