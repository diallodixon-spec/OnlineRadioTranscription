20260101 181810 I love you most We share a place We're special the times together It seems like our love Can't get much better No, no,, no. Cause we were as close as two could be. A new love could last forever. We're more than just lovers. we're good friends And even if our love could drift away I wouldn't even think twice If I walked in the back again
