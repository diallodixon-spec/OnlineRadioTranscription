20251224 191815 Everybody's so punk on the internet Everyone's unbothered till they're not Every joke's just trolling and memes Sad as it seems seems. Apathy is hot. Everybody's cut throat in the comments. Every single hot take is cold as ice. When you found me, I said I was busy. That was a lie. I have been afflicted by a terminal uniqueness. I've been dying just from trying to seem cool But I'm not the baddest And this isn't savage But I'm never gonna let you die
