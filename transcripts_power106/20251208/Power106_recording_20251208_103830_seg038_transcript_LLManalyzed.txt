50 million tourists to the Gulf. The only country that get, that France, I think, is the largest in terms of tourists. 100 million. And Saudi Arabia say they want to surpass that by 50 million. Now Jamaica, just a good one. And guess what? Guess what? In Saudi Arabia, because as I keep saying, we keep bringing in these cruise ship style hotels that won't help because of the economy. The cheapest hotel that you can get in Saudi Arabia right now is $2,000 per night and that is exclusively for just the room. So everything else that you're consuming that hotel, you have to buy it. We have a hotel out here called All Inclusive.
