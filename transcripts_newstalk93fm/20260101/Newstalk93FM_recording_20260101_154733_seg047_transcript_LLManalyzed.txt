20260101 154733 It's been a while, let me know Did you end up moving house? You're the only one who knows that name You're the only who does that face I just wanna know if you're okay Only have a couple minutes and already mine feels like Back on your sofa Of course I still care Love's never wasted when it's shared And although it's over, I'll always be there
