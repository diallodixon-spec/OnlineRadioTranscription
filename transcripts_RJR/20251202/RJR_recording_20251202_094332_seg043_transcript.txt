to read you the question, truth be told. In relation to the Speaker of the House, the Speaker has asked for strict adherence to the rules of the House, which is understandable. The problem, though, is this. You see, in debate, especially in the House, it becomes so regimented that it has the unintended consequence of stymieing the flow of debate. And I'll tell you why I said that. Indulge me if you will, who federal trust was on the time that I have. Parliament, and I'm not speaking of folks in the rules, I'm just saying because when I was there, I mean, reach them, because we went all over the board without addressing the question or providing a question, but parliament has a thing called parliamentary privilege, and there's a thinking behind that, the thinking behind that, that you have a type of flow in parliament.
