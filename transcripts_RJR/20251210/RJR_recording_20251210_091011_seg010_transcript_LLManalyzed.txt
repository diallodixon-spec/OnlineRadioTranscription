in my commentary on Sunday about let's say you publish something and say that an individual is a paedophile or something like that we're not not go so at all ever and then the police might have investigated and not not come out of it because it's a lie what happens as a consequence of that and those are the questions because I believe with social media too much looseness is going around too much looseness and people are irresponsible and don't understand that loose tongues can destroy people's lives it's just sheer wickedness for some people to do what they're doing.
