Wait up, and Show me love! Sucker make we shun up together. No place that I'd rather be. Shun up together. Right now is our energy up together Soccer is our pathway Shung up together I tell you so much on my mind That I can't sleep I stress in all the time I can't sleep Cause I'm always on the grind My body's not keep up Deep behind all of my heart
