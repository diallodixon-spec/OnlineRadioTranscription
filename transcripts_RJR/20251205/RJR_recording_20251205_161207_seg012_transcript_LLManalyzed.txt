My girl, I say you're wonderful And when you bust a wine, you know you cause trouble. My girl, I said you're beautiful. Put your hand on your knees and start juggling. The way you bend your back and twerk it. Trimble your bumper, work it. Take your time, my girl, and reverse it. And when you turn it around, back way. The way you're winding, and jamming, and shaking You make me want to move My love, the way you're moving, and grooving, and vibrating You make me wanna move
