20260101 214833 When the pain comes knocking at my door My body can't take it No more, no, no more Can't sleep at night All the doctors, but they found no cure My strength is almost gone And my faith just can't keep going on, Lord But if I call on the Lord I must be sure all my burdens He bears every hour There is healing for you and for me
