20251225 145431 We're working for your better life. One year done, a next one come though. We're ready for the new year. And for the new year, a better way to seek mistakes. And this year, we're not gonna repeat. Oh, last year was love, people, last year. So when the new year come, give thanks if you see it. Even up this year, with the next year, as sweet to see what we planned this year. Next year, we reap a crime-free Christmas. We're ballin' for peace, all if next year is a new year, and you see, this year we might not have a tree, but some of us are telling me, say, next year is for me, boy. One year done, and next one come. No, we're not see done. We ready for the new year. No one a gift to him. I wish for the Christmas. I say, next year, they shatter them no suspicious. Bad-mind people would die.
