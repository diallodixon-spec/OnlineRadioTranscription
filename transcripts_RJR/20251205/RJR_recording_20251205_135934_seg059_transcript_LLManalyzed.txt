============================================================

all a Splendorific day from Dexter. Happy birthday wishes to Homer Harris who will be celebrating his special day tomorrow. You know some people call his name Omar but he's not Harris. You believed in me through it all even those times when I didn't believe in myself. Greetings from Heather Peart and this one's the woman inspector Denise Butler of the Manchester Division of the JCF.
