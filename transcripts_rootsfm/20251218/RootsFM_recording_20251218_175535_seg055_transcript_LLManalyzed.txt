20251218 175535 Nobody loves me better Makes me happy Makes me feel this way Ain't nobody loves me better I wait for night time to bring to me Can't believe I'm the one I was so lonely. I feel like no one's here. I must be dreaming. I want this dream to be real. I need this feeling. I make my wish upon this heart and hope this night will last forever. Oh, oh, oh, oh. Ain't nobody funny. Trust me baby, trust me baby. Makes me happy this way. Makes me feel this way. ain't nobody funny baby. Trust me baby.
