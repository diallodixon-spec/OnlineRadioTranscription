We're not feeling under the weather You just make me feel sweet Iced the cocoa tea, used the sugar I'm talking that we are complete, darling Heat me up Only you alone can put fire back in my soul Heat me up And they're telling me I should leave that fire alone Well, the more they tell me, it's the more I holdin' you close I could never let you go Miss Oshine, miss Oshine Y'all are comin' home, I will see you
