20251222 142112 I got a lot of pain Said I got a bad fate, a fate, a fate Baby, I know you're asking me to stay She say please, please, please don't go away You say I'm giving you the blues But girl, she's not giving you the blues Baby, you mean every word you say Can't help but think of yesterday And another who tied me down with a love of war rules before this river becomes an ocean before I throw my heart back on the floor oh baby I reconsider that foolish notion well I need someone to hold me but I'll wait for something more but I. But I gotta have faith, faith, faith. I gotta have, I gotta have. I gotta have faith. No, I gotta have faith to faith to faith. Baby, baby. But I got to have faith. I got to have, I got to have.
