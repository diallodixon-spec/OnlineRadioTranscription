I will stay two to three hours on Saturdays. I go down there, I will just sit in the classroom, I will wear a mask. And these, of the five students that I got signed, because I worked on all of them, it was five students at the time I was able to get signed. Of the five students, four of them passed the CSEC exam. Three of them got Karine, three and one of them got Karin, too. Did you find that you had to convince the students themselves that Yemen, you can do this? They were excited. They were excited to have been signed for the subject. Oh, wow. For the fact that they were excited that in itself bring that motivation to them to already believe they can do it. Getting that signature on it was enough for them to feel like, yes, I got this. And they were present. They came consistently to the after school sessions. And on Saturday, they were also present. And they were in bed state.
