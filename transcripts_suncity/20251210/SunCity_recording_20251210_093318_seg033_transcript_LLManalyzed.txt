Uh-huh. Yeah, yeah, you'll not live twice, yo Fall out of the road on the righteous path Still focus and conscious, put your in your tartar, say Go get the wicked, them corrupt your heart Do the right thing, become the worst, yes or yes all? Take away yourself from trouble, from trouble, man. Cause it come in a double. Take away yourself, from trouble. From trouble. Same as the sinking sun. Take away yourself. From trouble, man.
