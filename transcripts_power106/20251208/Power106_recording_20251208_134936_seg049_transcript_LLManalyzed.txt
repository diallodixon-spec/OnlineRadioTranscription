fighting for survival who is this male listener in New York thank you very much why is it they cannot critically see the real traitors were directly on the plantation and the whole scenario was fighting for survival of all especially people of African ancestry under the horrible and brutal conditions of the colonial enslavers I'm going to say I'm going to put it out there straight up, that what the Maroons achieved in that treaty is tremendous given the conditions they had. There is no way at all, it is not virtually, it is virtually impossible, impossibly that the Maroons could have sat down with the British and just threaten them into oblivion just threaten them and say see the treaty here write it down. Bad man will get land but nobody can trouble bad man again the Maroons could not continue to fight the Britons forever
