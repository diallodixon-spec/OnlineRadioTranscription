Thank you. Thank you. Thanks. Thank you very much. Thank you. Very much for having us. Thank you. Welcome. Some stations lead. Others follow. Except no imitations. This is Power 106. The new KFC Doritos singer. The irresistible flavor of KFC and Doritos. A combo that's finger licking good. The time by KFC is... 7 o'clock. Welcome to Mission Rebuild. Sharing some of the latest updates about the post-Hurricane Melissa relief and recovery efforts. I'm Monique Whitefield, stay tuned. Water Commission customers have been restored. However, much work is being done to ensure those still without reliable access to the precious commodity get attention.
