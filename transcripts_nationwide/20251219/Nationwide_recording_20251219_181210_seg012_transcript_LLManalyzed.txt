20251219 181210 The literature sports report, I'm Alex Raby. We blow things off with some cricket as resuming and 110 without loss. The West Indies at sports time reach 144 for 2, still trailing by 435 runs on day 3 of the third and final test against New Zealand at the Bay Oval. John Campbell, 45, and Brendan King, 63, are the batsmen back in the pavilion. Kaverm Hodge, 24, and Tevin Imluk, who is yet to get off the mark, are the not-ot batsmen. Earlier, New Zealand declared their first innings on 575-8, built on a commanding sentry from Captain Tom Latham and Devon Conway. Latham led from the front with 137, while Conway produced a dominant double sentry, scoring 227. All-rounder Rachin Ravindra added valuable lower-order runs, remaining notch-out and 72 at the time of the declaration. For the West Indies bowlers, Jayden Seals, Anderson Phillips, and Justin Greaves were the most successful, each claiming two wickets.
