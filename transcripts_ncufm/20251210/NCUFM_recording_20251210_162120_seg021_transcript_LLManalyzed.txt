============================================================

You see me clapping my hands and just praising the Lord Every time you see me stamping my feet Thinking, my lord, that he did it for me Every time you see, me stamping my feet I don't know if it's true, but it's true, it's true. I don't know what's going on, but I don't care. I don't care if it's true or not, I don't care what's going on. I don't give a shit. I don't even care if it's not true or not. I don't really care if it's real or not. I just don't care.
