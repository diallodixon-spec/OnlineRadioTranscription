20251222 100405 Radio Jamaica, active for the good of our nation. This Christmas, choose life. As we recover from Hurricane Melissa's devastation, we're reminded that life is fragile. Pedestrians, stay alert. Drivers, slow down. Rest if you're tired, and never drink and drive. One careless decision can change a family forever. Let's have a safe and prayerful Christmas and a crash free 2026. We have been requested to announce the deaths of normally Morgan Blass, Mama Blass and Lydia Morgan.
