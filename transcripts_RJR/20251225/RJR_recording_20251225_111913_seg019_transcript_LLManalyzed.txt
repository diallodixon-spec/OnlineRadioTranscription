20251225 111913 much for your lovely present of a partridge in a pair three. We're getting the hang of feeding the partridge now, although it was difficult at first to win its confidence. It bit the mother rather badly in the hand, but they're good friends now, and we're keeping the pair three indoors in a bucket. Thank you again, yours affectionately, Governor O'Lownessie. Day two. Dear Nola, I cannot tell you how surprised we were to hear from you so soon again, and to receive your lovely present of two turtle dogs. You really are too kind. At first, the Patridge was very jealous and suspicious of the dogs, and they had a terrible row on the night the dogs arrived. We had to send for the vet. But the birds are OK again, and the stitches is due to come out in a week or two. The vet's bill was £8, but the mother is over her annoyance now, and the doves and the pathridge are watching the telly from the pear tree as I write. Yours ever, Gobnet. Day three. Dear Nula, we must be foremost in your thoughts. I had only posted my letter when the three French hens arrived.
