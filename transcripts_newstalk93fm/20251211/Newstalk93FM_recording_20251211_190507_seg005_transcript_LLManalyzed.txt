Can't you go back to how you loved on me when you started? I'll be here begging for you. You should be giving me love all day till the day is done. So if you want to go that way way I'll be waiting for you to come pick up your clothes I have them folded Leave me at the door while it's still open But that don't mean that I can't wish you better We ain't good, good, but we still good
