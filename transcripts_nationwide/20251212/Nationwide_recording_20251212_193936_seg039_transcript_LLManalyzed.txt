20251212 193936 Girl, how do you know about customs? You don't want to stop listening to hearsay? Have you ever experienced that? Customs don't go into your package, suitcase, barrel or cargo unless you ship the item or the agent stand up right there when when they might inspect it. Listen, customs job is to protect the borders, collect revenue and to facilitate trade. They don't collect or store shipment, they inspect it and somebody has to present it for inspection. Hey, so how customs ever get so much customers? Tracy, and the only one involved in the clearance process, even though it's them we tend to talk about. Look at it this way. Shipment delayed? Talk to your airline agent. Missing items? Talk to your freight forwarder. The charges surprise you now. Call customs.
