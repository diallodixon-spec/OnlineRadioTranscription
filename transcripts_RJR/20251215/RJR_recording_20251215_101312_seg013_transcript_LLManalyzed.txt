20251215 101312 how the public sector works, what are the challenges, and of course, what needs to happen under different various circumstances while it's in the employ of the public sector. I think it's good because it also, I believe, allows us to, in terms of this greater understanding, also to be not as harsh as sometimes we can be with persons in the public sector, hopefully, but at the very least, of course, we're happy to be able able to share that. So very shortly we'll be taking a break to go to the House Sweet at the Fruit with the Jamaica Civil Service Association, looking at the news, see where they're raising funds for the gentleman who tackled one of the terrorists yesterday. He was shot. He's in hospital hospital but he's expected to recover. I gather that they've raised almost one million dollars on his behalf and of course to help him set him back on the right track, on a more easier track in life.
