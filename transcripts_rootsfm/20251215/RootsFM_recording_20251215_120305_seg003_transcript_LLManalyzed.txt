20251215 120305 And all our friends, Jamaica, overseas, and wherever you are, I just greet you with one word, love. I love you all. And may the love of God continue to flow in our heart. And for all those who enjoy Christmas and for all those who don't enjoy Christmas on the behalf of roots, when it comes, we love you, and we appreciate you, and we thank you that you're a part of our family. God bless you. God bless you, God bless you God bless you. It's another day. I miss you. I miss you, I miss you. A couple days I was out because of Melissa, but I believe I'm back in Jesus name. But the Lord gave and the Lord take it away. Blessed is the man that trusts in him. And today, I'm happy. I'm happy. The sun is shining and we have life. So come on my people. My people, my people, my people. We have life and life more abundantly. So they requested my heart. Let me talk about my heart first.
