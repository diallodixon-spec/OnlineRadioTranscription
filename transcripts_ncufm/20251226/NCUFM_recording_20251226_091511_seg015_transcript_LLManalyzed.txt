20251226 091511 The Bible is filled with many promises and each day we try to claim them. From Genesis to Revelation we read about people just like you and me who receive God's promises. These promises are sealed by the highest authority, God's Word. Today our promises come in from 2 Corinthians 9 verse 8, which reads, God is able to bless you abundantly, so that in all things, at all times, having all that you need, you will abound in every good work. Today's Boxing Day. A day that has always carried the spirit of generosity.
