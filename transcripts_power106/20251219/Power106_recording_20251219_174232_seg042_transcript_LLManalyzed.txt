20251219 174232 I go use the telemelo Finally I find way to talk to the girl but she ain't no one follow Who you gonna fall for? Why you no one call for one? Then I start to feel a bum bum one But she didn't give me small small one I know she said she's a bit bossy down one one But she feelin' insecure Cause her friends go they got my lighting gone one Go they got my lightning gone one Yeah I know we look sharp but for you I can't tell no one Baby show me you can calm down, calm down Dance with me and take the lead now, lead now Got you so high that you can't come down, come down Don't you ask, you know you're allowed, allowed When it's you I can't say no
