20251230 165131 Leave me alone, it's best you just leave me alone See what I'm trying to say is that this caused me so much pain Feeling like I've got no control over my own brain And it's sad to see life you so sweet Come and ring off me line seven days at the week Oh me nothing right now, me nothing sweet Leela beg you this, Leela beg you that Shut your eyes, cut the crap 2020 now certain things we saw So we disappear to the habitat that goes everybody's trying to talk to me, but nobody want to hear me Everybody's got some things to say honestly, then just move them out Leave me alone
