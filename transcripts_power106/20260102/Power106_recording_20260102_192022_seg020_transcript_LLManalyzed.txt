20260102 192022 to it's now 19 back in 1993 which is just a couple of the date january 17 1993 will of course live in infamy as far as i'm concerned and what happened then was that the claiming system the 100 sure to fail claiming system was launched by the conspiracy theorists of the day who thought that book, which was responsible for the development of racing globally, bookmaking, and that the trading of racehorses could be, or should be, an economically viable activity. Looking back at it now, I was very serious at the time, but I'm laughing because there were persons like myself, Mr. Patrick, so Mr. Howard Hamilton was around, big handicapper, engaged by the Jamaica Racing Commission, Mr. Leslie McCray and myself as a young person, but one who understands handicapping, knew that this team was going to fail the racing industry.
