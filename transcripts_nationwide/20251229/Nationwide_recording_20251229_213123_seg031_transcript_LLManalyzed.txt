20251229 213123 Keep on moving it forward and live with no fear Feel the rush as you buckle up Feel it, I'm still here to pull the chuckle up One time come again, make a double up Pick up the youth and now the struggle up Make the most of it, most of life, we'll feel alive Nobody can breathe the strife that comes from mine So let me come and reach the sky Every time you hear it coming Feel the rush Oh, feel it in the air Keep on movin moving it forward And live with no fear Feel the rush I feel it everywhere keep on moving it forward and live with no fear Yo! Yo!
