20251229 103423 This is Clive Mullings. Good morning, welcome. Hi, Mr. Mullings. Morning, sir. How are you doing? Good. Same to you, sir. Welcome. What's up? I'm trying to understand something here. And it's always good when you can turn to the learned person. And I do hope that I am not the only person. Well, hope in a good sense that I'm not the only person that can be highlighted. I live in St. Elizabeth, and I have been without water and light since the ending of October. In terms of the billing cycle for the utility companies, I expected that I would have gotten a bill at the end of October, which I did naturally. November I did in terms of the cycle, which is fine, still without light or water. But December I have not gotten a water bill and I haven't had any water.
