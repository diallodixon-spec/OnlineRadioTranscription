I feel like sometimes it's important for employers, people at school, teachers. When women say it is painful, it is something different. Like when women say, I can't come and work because of this pain, people look and say, oh, she'll make it up. She's just being dramatic because how painful can it be? And even some doctors as well, they shun it off. Some doctors as well. It's unfortunate, but when a woman is having pain, she's having pain. Yes, yes, yes, yes. Ladies, it is not normal and you must go and seek advice and help. What's the right approach for women who are listening now? They've never done a pap smear, they've never done a mammogram, what do they, what do they do? We still say pap smears or do we say pap tests? Is it pap smear? Pap smear, pap smear, still pap smear. Okay. I think, I think it's a fear of the unknown.
