20251231 201415 We're back last week, we took a break, and it's time because of the elections, obviously. And as you know by now, the JLP walked away with the win. But tonight, we're back to regular programming, and we're turning up the heat. Now the topic on the table is, who comes first? The wife, the girlfriend, or the mom? We're unpacking the culture of mama's boys, the way men set their priorities, and what it means when those priorities clash. Is it love? Is it loyalty? Or is it just confusion creating drama in relationships? What does it really mean when those priorities clash? Is putting your mother first a sign of respect? Or does it show that you're really not ready to be the head of a household should a girlfriend or wife have to compete with mama yes and on the flip side are women really expecting too much when they demand that a man cut the umbilical cord and put them first yes so we're gonna be unpacking it all tonight and I really actually cannot wait to hear from you guys
