mind with peace and cover their path with your purpose. Father, we know that many are the plans in the hearts of a person, but it is you, O Lord, and your purpose that prevails. I pray this moment, Lord, that every man would walk confidently in the purpose you have placed on his life. Lead him when the path seems unclear and remind him, Lord God Almighty, that your plans are good and full of promise. Let him not be swayed by distractions or fear. Let this man that is listening this prayer right now be strengthened. Strengthen his steps with conviction and fill him with passion for the calling you have given him.
