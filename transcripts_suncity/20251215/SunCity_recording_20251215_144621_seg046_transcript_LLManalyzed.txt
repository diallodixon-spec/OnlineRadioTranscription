20251215 144621 Oh, Lord, my God, when I'm in awesome wonder Consider all thy works thy hand art made I see the stars, I hear the mighty thunder. Thy power throughout the universe displays. Then sings my soul, and my Savior God to thee. I God to me. I'm way down, I'm way down. Thanks be to my soul, my Savior God to me. My God to me.
