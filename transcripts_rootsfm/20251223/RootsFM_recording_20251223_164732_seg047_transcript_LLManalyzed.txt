20251223 164732 I hope we never get tired. Never up and going. We're just in the moment. Love each other. Hold each other. Oh, baby, crying. No, baby. No heart blowing. No heart flowing. Just the love of our lives is calling. Sweet, sweet, sweet words of love. Hope we never get tired, hope we never get tired. No one knockin' on the door, no one invited guests about. No, no, no, no.
