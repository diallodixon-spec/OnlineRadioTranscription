If you're down, I'll hit you on the cell. Holler at me later, honey. You can feel it, baby, I can tell. Later, I'll be ringing on your bell. Hit me a lot of houses and cars, couldn't know which one was which. And finally a chick and getting hitched. Living the fairytale life perfect without a hitch.
