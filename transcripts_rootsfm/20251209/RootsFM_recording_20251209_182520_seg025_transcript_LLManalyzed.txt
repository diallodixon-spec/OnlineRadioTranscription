I want shoes and no foot, they ma say me are the truth. One pants to me waist, they ma bend off them face. And shot from me back, they say me they pan top. They put on me vest, and me never get dressed. Put on me vest and me never get bent. And me gone up a mongoose town. So me see the sister, they ma get dressed. And I ma to catch my jealousness and go put on my face, yeah We no check off the rude boy corner, we no check off the bad boy corner. God sees them change from half a pouch to half a pence and gone on to dollar and cent. The sucker can't even pay them rent. They come in all the morning, a lot, lot come in all the evening.
