2025-12-12 12:11:30 Now the years have come and the years have gone And the cause of Jesus still goes on Now the time has come to count the cost To reject this world, to embrace the cross And one by one let us live our lives For the one who died to give us life Till the trumpet sounds on that final day Let us proudly stand and boldly say, I pledge allegiance to the land. With all my strength, with all I am, I will seek to honor His command.
