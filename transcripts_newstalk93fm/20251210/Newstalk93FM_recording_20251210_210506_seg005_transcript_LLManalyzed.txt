============================================================

This world concrete, flowers grow. Hard days, she only doing what she know. Weakens, skitter popping on the low. Better days coming for sure. This world, world. If it was up to me, I wouldn't give if nobody's no sympathy. I'd take away the pain, I'd give you everything. I just wanna see, wanna see. If this I'm coming for that, on my soul. Bobby, clown, risk, fraud. Check, count, on the way home. In this world, concrete flowers grow. Hard days, she only doin' what she know. Weekends, get it poppin' on the lawn.
