Oh, the girl in my eyes She is all in my mind The girl in my mind Somebody walk into my life And it's right on time Somebody look into my eyes And they my mind. And it's you. I only need to tell you that it's you. You're everything I ever dreamed would come to me. Somebody walk into my heart, into my surprise. Somebody's tearing me apart, and it feels just fine.
