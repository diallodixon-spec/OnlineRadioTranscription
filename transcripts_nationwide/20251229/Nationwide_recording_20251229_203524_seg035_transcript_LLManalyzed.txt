20251229 203524 I'm burning up, burning up for your love For your love You're always closing the door Well that only makes me want you more And day and night I cry for your love You're not convinced that that is enough To justify my haunting you Now tell me what you want me to do I'm not blind and I know That you want to want me but you can't let go Come on, let go I'm burning up, burning up for your love Do you wanna see me down on my knees? I'm bounding over backwards now, would you be pleased? I'm like the others, I do anything
