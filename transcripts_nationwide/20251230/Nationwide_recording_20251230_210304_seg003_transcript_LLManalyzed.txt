20251230 210304 I push them. I say, look, we have a big match tomorrow. Go to bed and get high quality sleep. You asked me for a few tips and I will close out like this. If it is that you're not getting high quality sleep, the first thing to start with George is to go to your bed at a set time every night. Don't worry about the fact that for the first couple of days, probably even weeks, you might not be falling asleep because your circadian rhythm may have changed and we're going to be talking about that next week. Go to the bed the same time every night. Between 30 minutes to two hours, shut down all electronic devices. We will, when we do pathophysiology next week, you will see how that affects melatonin, which is a sleep hormone. So we shut down. So we ask books to say to everyone, texting close off at 9.30. So he won't receive any texts at that time. I know it's difficult.
