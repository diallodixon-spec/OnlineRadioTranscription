20251225 102311 I should stay in this relationship. When I'm hurting, baby, I ain't happy, baby. Plus there's so many other things I gotta do it. I think that you should let it burn. When the feeling ain't the same in your body, don't want you to know that I let it go. Because the party ain't drooping like it used. Oh, no. Even though that's my cruise ship. Let it burn, let it burn, gotta let it burn Deep down you know it's best for yourself But you hate the thought of being with someone else your name. Ladies, tell me, do you understand? And all my fellas, do you feel my pain? It's the only way I feel. I knew I made a mistake.
