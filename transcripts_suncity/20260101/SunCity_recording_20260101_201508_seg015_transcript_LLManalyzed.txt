20260101 201508 Yo! Right eye, right eye, right eye. I don't wanna lose, I don't wanna be real. I'm so tired of the rain, in my life. And I'm so tired on the streets, in Sunsea. And I ain't gonna knock up. Sometimes I can't sleep at night and this here it just don't seem right and sometimes I just wonder why I almost let my life go by.
