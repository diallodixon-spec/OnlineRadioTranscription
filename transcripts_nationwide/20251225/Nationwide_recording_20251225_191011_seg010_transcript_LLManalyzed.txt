20251225 191011 My fellow Jamaicans, a blessed Christmas to you all. Christmas in Jamaica is a joyful season of delightful sounds, colors, smells, and tastes. It has a special pace of living with unique national and family traditions. From the earliest morning when sorrows start to bloom, to the laughter that fills our yards, to the simple acts of checking on a neighbor, Christmas brings out the best in us. It's a time when we gather with loved ones and friends to celebrate the gift of salvation and hope through the birth of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. Christmas is also a time to embrace the spirit of generosity and compassion and to extend a helping hand to those who are facing challenges. This is particularly true this year as our country continues to bear the effects of the devastating hurricane that hit our island on the 28th October.
