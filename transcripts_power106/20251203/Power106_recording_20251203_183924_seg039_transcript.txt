And all of this is relatively new to us. I've been in basketball for 40 years, but we're still learning as we go in some respects. So there was no doubt that we were going to have our hands full in these two games. And we did. They're a really good team. And it took a buzzer beater for us on Friday night with Kofi getting the tip in at the buzzer. And, you know, I thought we played a really solid game on Monday night. You know, we took a 20 point lead in the third quarter and they, you know, they, they chipped back into it like any good, you know, professional type team would do. Basketball is a game of runs and, you know, you don't want to get too, too high when things are going your way and you don't wanna get too low when things aren't going your way.
