20251219 212118 Tell me it's true. I can't believe you do what you do. I've got so much love. And my love, you'll see, we'll stay together, just you and me. I've got so much love, only you. Tell me how to love you, baby. I don't mind, and I don't mind. Girl, I love you. I'm always thinking of you. You are the sun. You are the rain that makes my life this foolish game. You're me tonight.
