20251215 215122 Laid back. Laid back. This is the best we've got in London! All the people around the world are what to do. I don't know where to go. I don't even know where to go, I don't know how to get to the station. From that point in time, I respect destination. With a dissipation, raising out of easy tension. Wait up, look down the box, look up now. So informer, you know say that I'm a snowman, I go playin'. I like it, boom, boom, damn. Take the money, I say say that I am a snowman, stop, snowboard down the lane.
