So I had to pay upfront, trying to get back some money from the compassionate funds. And to date, I still have not got back that. No, nothing from them. I've been back and forth, back and forthing and nothing. I don't know. There's a policy of refund, you know. I believe there's none. And what they should do is just communicate that upfront rather than have you back and forthing because I think if the money has been spent, there's not a policy to give back that money. But I'll check on it your number but I'm almost sure that's the policy so if that is the case they should just tell you upfront that that is not allowed that is not under the policy all right just leave your number for me
