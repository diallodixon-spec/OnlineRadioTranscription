20251222 091308 You have to give thanks. It's a blessing. If you're a part of this process of life, the inhaling and exhaling process, you are alive. You are here today. You are here now. Consider yourself lucky. Consider yourself fortunate. The Almighty is blessing you without you even knowing. So give thanks at all times. Every chance you get, the blessings are insurmountable, man. The omnipotent one is always looking over us. Never you take for granted. And for my fans out there right now, listening, think of yourself as a living, walking, breathing blessing. You know the Almighty is working through you and for you at this very point in time without you even knowing. I understand that's how awesome He is and that's how awesome life is. So be thankful, be grateful, be respectful and understand that without Him nothing is possible. Without Him you are not possible. You are breathing, are living, and that in itself is the most awesome blessing there is. So listen to my voice. You are blessed. Much love.
