When you win, it's a sweet story. When you're not made, the war is bitter. It's quick to call me a sinner. Only that I know my history. So we have to keep making glory. Like a tree planted by the river. I a smile in the sun. Yeah, keep it down, cause we have to overcome. Positively clear when I light up on Mitchell, boy. Tell yourself the truth, we're not gonna beg them for no sponsor. Crabby number red, we'll always try to pull you under. Big and strife, we'll break you, wanna kill you, make you stronger. Play my thoughts with a little meditating. Out it's bitter You pick to call me a sinner Only judge I don't mind
