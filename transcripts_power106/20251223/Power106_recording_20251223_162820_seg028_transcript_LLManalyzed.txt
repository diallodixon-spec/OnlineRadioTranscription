But you taught me personally the Jamaica Labour Party has come. I had nothing to do with that. I know, I know. But it's me spread the message and sell the message of the party, you know, Auntie. And you give me that platform. But I want to say thanks to the Jamaican people who choose Jamaica and do this again for the third term.
