20251225 201818 And I don't know what to do I see you pass my way Do you remember the day? Would you stop just once? Is all I'm asking Cause I keep thinking about myself There's something about the way you were Oh, I wish that we could smile Fits and cuddle in the park As you look at his eyes, oh no I'm gonna take you far away Far away, far away I'm gonna leave you say you're cold Unto myself Is all I want to know what to do All my friends are angry They think I'm crazy
