Oh, what can I say? Though they come in the multitude Trying to rob and abuse Yes, we've got that by my side Yes, this battle, I know, has been close They say we've got delivered down there And the children of Israel Watching our destiny, yes I know we can do it again. Come along and take control. Look what they're doing to your world. Oh God, oh God, oh God.
