20251215 155841 I'm a player. Souls Sunday in Portmore. No, in May Penn. Okay, May Penn. Right? Yeah. I play a select soul Sunday and then the promoter come to me and say, you know, so I selected them and say, you can't mix and the souls in here may have mixed. Yeah. And he was so amazed. Mm hmm. That's why some of the time, I don't ever really care. Sometimes when people say about you, you know, because at the end of the day, they're not going to really approach your face and say that. Mm hmm. And if you rest that by your mind, you know, really put nothing in your thinking, you know. Mm hmm. You just left for empty space. So, you have to just keep positive and just keep your work going and do the best when you come out. Definitely. That's the key. You play as if you that it will be your last year. Yes. Yeah, you just play good. I'm always at home work. If I make a mistake, I correct it as I go in. I don't wait until I play again, I try to correct it. I know sometimes you listen back to your cell phone. A lot. When you do a recording. Yeah, because I was worried about the CD.
