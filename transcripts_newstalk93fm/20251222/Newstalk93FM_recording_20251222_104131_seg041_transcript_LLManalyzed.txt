20251222 104131 Please hear my cry and if I ever Let you down my friend It was a misunderstanding So if I took you for granted You're not promised from today I go jump like I never jump Waved like I never waved Bind like I never wand before Just to show you I saw you I saw you And I need you back in my life You got people by by the truck. Emotions running high. We are not in the sky. Just running down with high. Can't you tell that we sorry? We sorry. And we need you back in with high. I need you come on to me. Come on to me. I, I, it's time to bless the good. Come to you, come to you. I need you. Come to me, come to me. Come to me.
