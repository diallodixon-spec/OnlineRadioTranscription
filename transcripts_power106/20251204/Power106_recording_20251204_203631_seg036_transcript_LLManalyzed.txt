============================================================

We have a lot of excess food at points in time. I'm encouraging persons not to take the warm food and put it in the refrigerator. When you do that, it's going to cause the chamber of the refrigerator to warm up. When it warms up, the fridge, and especially we have a lot of smart fridges these days, they're going to realize that, oh no, we're not operating at a temperature that should keep the food safe. So it will warning against overstocking the fridge as this will require more energy to cool the items.
