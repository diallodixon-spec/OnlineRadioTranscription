2025-12-12 10:19:25 Every day we start again Say a prayer for the world And send all your love to all creation Oh yeah And when the darkness rolls in There's a light still shining, yeah Oh yeah Suspended here in twilight There's a road I'm finding, yeah Oh yeah a prayer. Say a prayer for the world. Only love can save us now. Say a prayer, for the world.
