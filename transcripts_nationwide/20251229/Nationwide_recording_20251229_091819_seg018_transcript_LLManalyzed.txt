So please, I am asking if you guys can assist us in any way in ensuring that another family doesn't have to go through that. Thank you. Oh so sorry to hear about that Nadine but to the point you're making really yes we must add our voices to that to to those who the NWA and others who are responsible for for bridges and roads please ensure that the La Cobra bridge does not um further into the new year without barriers because another incident um like this could be a possible and we really don't want that uh well alright we we are yeah man we're at the point oh sorry about that nadi
