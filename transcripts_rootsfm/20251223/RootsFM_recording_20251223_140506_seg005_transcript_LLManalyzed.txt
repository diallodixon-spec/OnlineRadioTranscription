20251223 140506 day for you. A lot of people just live for the moment. But is it that you believe in Christmas though? Some people don't believe in Christmas, see what I'm speaking. Because I was told about a pastor, he was asked a question. We're in the Bible, it stated that Christ was born on Christmas Day and the pastor he stood there could even answer yeah he stood there not saying a word from one of his church members asked where in the Bible does it state that Christ was born on Christmas Day? I don't know, I don't know. I want somebody to call me now and give me in details if you are inclined with your Bible.
