============================================================

Love does not excuse because excuse tolerates evil. Excuse do not correct. Excuse do not redeem. Excuse cannot save a soul. The widow in the gospel is praised because she refused to offer excuse and chose to offer love. On the other hand, the scribes and the teachers of the law were condemning and they were saves because love forgives. Today, the widow reminds us, number one, giving makes you happier.
