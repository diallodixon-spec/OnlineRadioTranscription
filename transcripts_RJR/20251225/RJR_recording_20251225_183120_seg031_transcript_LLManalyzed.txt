20251225 183120 Christmas with her family and listening to the 94. Doreen Anderson also here with us. Hi Doreen, thanks for your company. Doreen says happy holidays to the staff of Rated Jamaica and to all the listeners. Pat in Kingston 19. Pat, I must salute you. You have listened to my favorite sound system and I salute you for that and sending you a happy Christmas, Christmas greetings. All right, but big up yourself. Still holding out hope that you will venture out one Christmas to experience Grand Market. All right. Carrie from Edmonton, Alberta is also locked in and enjoying the music. Carrie says, I wish I was home. It's very cold where she is right now. That's in Edmonton Alberta. That's in Canada. Also saying hi to the staff of PSTEB, especially those at the Collision Investor.
