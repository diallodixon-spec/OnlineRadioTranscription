Oh girl, oh girl, oh yeah, oh yeah. See the angel in your eyes. Girl, that love light shines so bright. I don't get your love. I think I'm gonna cry. Don't be your mind. Cruisin' my girl, cruisin' my girl. Yeah, yeah. I can see the angel in your eyes. Cruesin' my girl, yeah, yeah, yeah. I thought you were romancing in another man's arms. It hurt me so much, my whole life fell apart. How could this be? You're cheating on me. At first I was sad, but now I am glad.
