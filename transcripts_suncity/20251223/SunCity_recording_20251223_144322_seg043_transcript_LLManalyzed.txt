20251223 144322 Is you as you I don't want a lot for Christmas There is just one thing I need And I don't care about the Christmas Underneath the Christmas tree I won't even hang my stockings There upon the fireplace Santa Claus won't make me happy With a toy on Christmas day I just want you for my own more than you could ever know. Make my wish come true. Baby, all I want for Christmas is you.
