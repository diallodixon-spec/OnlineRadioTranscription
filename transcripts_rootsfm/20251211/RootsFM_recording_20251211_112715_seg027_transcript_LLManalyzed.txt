situation, bear in mind, you may be arrested because you are warranted out. And if you know you have warranted out, if you know you'd have one ticket from God who's a boy and you're not paid, check at least on the road before you apply for the police record and clear up the warrant and everything. All right? Especially when you check RTA, the RTA, if you have done any breaches of the RTA. Sometimes we pay the fee, but for some reason they are not seeing it on the system. If that is the case, the police can do investigation to realize whether or not a ticket was paid and then they fix it accordingly. But if the judge sent out a warrant for you, we have no other alternative but to execute those warrants. You know that the judge sent out warrants for police too. Tell me about that. Yes. Now that is really interesting.
