20251230 172113 Public Relations Officer for the Hummingbird's Association, Sharon Pursa Cooper, says the donation is in keeping with the 47-year-old organization's long-standing commitment to public health institutions in Jamaica. This equipment was donated before, prior to MENISA, and it is now even more timely in view of the fact that there is devastation, dislocation, and some serious challenges to health care in Jamaica. And so we're donating here today to the pediatric department. We were advised by the Minister of Health that there is a focus in Jamaica on improving pediatric health care quality. And so we asked for a needs list from the CEO of Cornwall and this was a request and we made everything on the needs list. She noted that CRH is one of several hospitals that have benefited from the association's outreach over the years.
