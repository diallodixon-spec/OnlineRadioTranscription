============================================================

state in which a few people control the total resources of the country and the majority just go hungry, hungry and go buy whatever means to survive because anarchy is the byproduct of need when too many of your people are in survival mode only, where there is no hope. But we can't let you get to that. That's why I'm saying the people have to demonstrate. The people are not going to do that on their own and we don't see anybody mobilizing the people in that regard. When they're in their position, they'll just take it and walk out of parliament and go up on social media. Well, with that kind of attitude, we will get what we deserve.
