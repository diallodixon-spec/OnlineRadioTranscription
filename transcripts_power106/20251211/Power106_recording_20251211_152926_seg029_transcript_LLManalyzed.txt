Until 12 o'clock in the night, right? That would come to 8 hours. Yes, 18. So the other 6 now, right? Would go back 6 a.m. the next day. So that's why I was wondering, how come to 18 hours because 18 hours, you know, and your lines man, no medical people or safety people would allow that for work. Because that safety hazard, if you go extend parallel to 18 hours. I hear you. I'm going to listen to a clip here. I'm seeing a clip of one minute and 12 seconds. I'm gonna listen in the break and then I will say what exactly was said in that post cabinet press briefing as it relates to calculations that were done
