20251218 093831 Let me ask them. So I'll go back to the clinic tomorrow and meet them. A two time a week while you wait on that six months to see the specialist? So you still have a visit before you hear definitively what you are to do? Okay, okay, okay, so I guess tomorrow then they they will tell you you know what they're seeing and what needs to be done maybe maybe the initial concern was maybe exaggerated and it's not as bad as they thought and you can continue to do your bi-weekly dressing
