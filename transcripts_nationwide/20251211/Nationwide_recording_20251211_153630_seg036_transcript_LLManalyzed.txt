The people shout, die now Level the vibe, we are level the vibe We ain't missed a night, woah Level the vibe, but we are leveled and fired We ain't missed the night If you're marching by your car, don't you brag and whine It's only reggae music, keep me scatting on my feet Skip and scan through the rebar, bop bop bada Cute man, sorry if I'm wrong, so Level the vibe we are, level the vibe Sweetness tonight, oh yes Level the E-Zone SSS DJ Drum and Ones on Tuesday, no, it's a Thursday December
