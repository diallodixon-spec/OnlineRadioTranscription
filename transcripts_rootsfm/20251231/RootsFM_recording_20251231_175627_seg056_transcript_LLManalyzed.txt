20251231 175627 What? So as we go through this life, I hope we do know that we are here to lean on each other and seek help where necessary. I do want to say thank you to Dr. Simpson for your insightful information and I do know that Roots will be calling you again because this is not just a one and done topic because there's so many different parts of mental health and wholesome health that we can go through. I want to say thank you to our studio engineer, Dwight Irwin, making sure that you can hear us clearly on the ones and twos. And what would Adjust the Truth be without you, my truth fam? Thank you for joining us. Thank you for listening. And as I always say, keep being safe and continue being awesome. Until next time, this is Ajust the Truth.
