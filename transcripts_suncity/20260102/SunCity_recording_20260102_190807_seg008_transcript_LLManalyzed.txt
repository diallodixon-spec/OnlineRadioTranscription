20260102 190807 Hi, my name's Kalia. I'm a flight attendant with British Airways, and when I'm travelling all over the world, I bring Sun City Radio with me via their website on www.suncityradio.fm or the app TuneIn.com or Radio Garden. Keep it locked to 104.9 FM Sun City radio, we a deal with. Stop the violence and the corruption, therefore make a better solution to the youth, them. You could a cuss, you could a bust, you could a ball. Because the guns, them, them have to leave with yard. Yo, this is your girl Shireen on front line duty for the rebuilding of Jamaica. What we say? The land we love. Sun City Radio 104.9 FM, radio with a difference. Radio with a difference.
