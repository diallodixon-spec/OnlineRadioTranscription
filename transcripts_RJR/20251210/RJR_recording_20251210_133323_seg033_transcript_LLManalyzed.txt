Hello and afternoon to Horace as we continue our conversation. Hello Horace, how are you? I don't know why love is always popping in. Horace is a crooner. Either in love or him trying to find love. Something about love or him just love love. But every Wednesday Horace is popping in when the love music is playing. I know you know this but you know he's a pretty good singer, right? I do. I do. I suspect that has something to is not true. That is not true. Two live listeners. Johnny is going very, no he's back turning to me when he comes in here. Johnny and Baker is going down the same slope right now and are not going down there with him.
