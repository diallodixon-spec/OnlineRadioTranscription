How are you? I'm good, thank you. How are you doing? What's happening? Not too bad. Mr. Mullings, let me tell you something. I have two, nine months, what would you call it now? Issued, issued. But before I let you know what I'm talking about, Mr Mullins, I want to have somebody criticize the government. Would you offend it? If I'm offended? Me personally? I'm just asking that, you know. You have me reason why I'm asking. Please. I'm not in government, you know. I know, I know. All right.
