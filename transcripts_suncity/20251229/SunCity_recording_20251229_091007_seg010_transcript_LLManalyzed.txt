Is this true to you? I want to tell you that God only pushes you. And when He pushes you, He pushes you hard enough because He knows how to get you. So when you fall, He will get you. So you have to stay focused. To stay focused, believe in yourself. Believe in the Almighty. Stand strong. And have faith. Work hard. And pray. And just do good. And you know, my testimony that I just make sure to say, you know, always think positive. Don't call on crosses by yourself. If a man says, what's going on?
