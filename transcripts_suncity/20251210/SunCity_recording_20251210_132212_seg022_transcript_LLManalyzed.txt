They ain't gonna see us fall Share all my riches and sing for my fans Love Mama Africa, oh Those vegans think they can't get a feel, oh Judgement, we fight them From their vegans, we got to excise them Girls and the rules and the tugs and the basement Playing music for the world, love is the replacement All my people, all all my dogs and all those little children and girls I love. They ain't gonna see us fall. They ain't going to see us fall. Share all my riches and sing for my fans. Love my mafrica, let me see you fall.
