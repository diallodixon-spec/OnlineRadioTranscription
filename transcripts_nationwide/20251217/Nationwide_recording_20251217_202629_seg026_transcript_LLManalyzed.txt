20251217 202629 It's the most beautiful time of the year Lights fill the streets spreadin' so much cheer I should be playin' in the winter snow But I'ma be under the mistletoe I don't wanna miss out on the holiday But I can't stop staring at your face I should be playing in the winter snow But I'ma be under the mistletoe With you, shorty with you With you, with you Shorty with you, with you Under the mistletoe Everyone's gathering around the fire
