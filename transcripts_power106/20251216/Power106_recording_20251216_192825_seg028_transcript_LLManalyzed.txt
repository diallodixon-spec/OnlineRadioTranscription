20251216 192825 This upcoming year, I have bigger plans for this year. I have a lot more events that I'm trying to get to. So I'll be doing a few more events in Florida. I'll be going to the West Coast and doing some events in California. And at the end of the year, next year, I'll be in Hawaii again for the winter season. So yeah, just trying to stay busy, trying to do as many events as possible. And yeah, the goal is ultimately to qualify for the Olympics. So a lot of these events that I go to are just to keep the blade sharp and keep the presence of Jamaican surfing out there. And yeah. I continue to stress the importance of getting young people into the sport out here because there's a lot of opportunity for young people in the sport of surfing in many different areas of the sport.
