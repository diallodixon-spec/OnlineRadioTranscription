============================================================

I just love the way you are. There's a time flies when you haven't found. I can't believe the year is almost there. Nobody else but you can make me feel the way I do. You make my dreams come true My wish for Christmas is having you here with me My wish for Christmas spending it with you My wish for Christmas it's how it's supposed to be My wish for Christmas Is how it's supposed to be My wish for Christmas is making dreams come true No greater gift than the gift of love
