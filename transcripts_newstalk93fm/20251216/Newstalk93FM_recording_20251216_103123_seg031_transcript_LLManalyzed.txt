We're concluding a discussion as it relates to the whole Christmas situation and so on and touching a little bit more general thing within the Papian Division right here in the constituency of Eastern St. Andrew. Of course, the Member of Parliament here is the Minister of Finance, the Honorable Th Favourable Williams, and the caretaker remain, for the constituency rather, remain Patricia Duncan Sutherland. Welcome back, Councillor Ferguson. Thanks for staying with us. Thank you, Conrad. Good. Councillor, your division over the years, you know, have pockets of violence, you know, Augustone and so on. We have been able to see the cessation in that. How 2025 treats you and what are your expectations going forward?
