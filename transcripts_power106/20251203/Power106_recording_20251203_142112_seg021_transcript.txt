Dr. Christine Hendricks will be our guest after the 3.30 break here on both sides of the story on Paw106FM. In the meantime, we're going to head right into our From the Archives feature brought to you by the Gleena Archives with the kind support of the Gleena Company Media Limited. We're going to head into that right now and then after the 2.30 break, we're going to open the phone lines. We'd like to hear from you. Of course, the call-in lines are 876-922-411-225 and the text and WhatsApp line is 876-279-8598. Well, lots to talk about, lots of issues, lots of developments in Jamaica and around the world. Well, we look forward to hearing what you have to say on the issues that you feel are important, right?
