============================================================

We'll make it through the storm Keep each other calm No need for raise alarm Make we low all the drama With you I have qualms. We're good at what we're not, lawyers to our teeth. You give your all to me in a way I won't forget. You mean so much to me. Why you really believe if you ever need me? Tell me there's just know I will be there That it wasn't back the way, no way I will be there
