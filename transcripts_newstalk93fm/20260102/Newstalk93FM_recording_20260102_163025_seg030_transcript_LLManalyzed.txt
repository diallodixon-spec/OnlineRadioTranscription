20260102 163025 London. I'm feeling vibes on vibes. I'm a freaking dynamite. I blow your condo light. You know I'm just that type. No, them nothing kill my vibe. Them nothing kill my vibe, them nothing kill you, them nothing kill, them nothing kill me. Why is my sex full of the stars? There you shall find a piece of advice If you hit your enemies, enemies shine If you're not a friend of me, enter the light Cause you can never kill my vibe Go out there with no sacrifices Everything was taken, still had to make it Vibe killer, me and you go and sit down. I go just like that.
