But, again, you still have to sit up, and if it takes the whole day for the body to really come back, where the pain reduced to five, four, three, two, two one that's when you are going to be released because if it doesn't if it doesn't you if the pain doesn't heal at the same time. So if you're seated, it takes longer then? Yes and no. As I said, it depends on how your body really manages the medication.
