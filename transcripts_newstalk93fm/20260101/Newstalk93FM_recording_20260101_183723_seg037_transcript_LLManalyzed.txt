20260101 183723 You know the things I wanna do tonight Unusual Put it down, make it tick away your piece of mind You go flow like water, we get it freeze or black Open your eyes Focus. Look what the hot body can do. Body be dancing. Snow white, so my body so fine. Drive past like a mirror inside. To want and a mirror inside. Makes sense, oh, makes sense. Hold my color near the seasons. Break glass, I look for my distance. Makes sense, so, make sense. Oh, my God, I need resistance. Break plans, I live for my distance. Make sense, oh. Make sense. Buddy, we look. Look what the old buddy can do.
