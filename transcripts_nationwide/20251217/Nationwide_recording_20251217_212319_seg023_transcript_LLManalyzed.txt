20251217 212319 Tell me one other piece of meat that must be a part of our Christmas dinner here in Jamaica. The last time you were here on the show, you've been doing a lot of things. One thing about you, you're going to be busy. So what's been happening since we last spoke? Well, it's been the usual content creating also in the process of establishing a catering company as well, with my good friend who was here last time as well, Stormy's Dining, and just doing better at what I do. We love that for you here, okay. What are your favorite Christmas cooking traditions? I love the sweets, the fruitcake, the sorrel. I love how different it is. It's never the same in different families. I'm seeing this discourse on social media since we've started to show that Christmas cake must be eaten.
