Yeah, she a professional bambam ruler She say bring it come, come and whip me down, don't let nothing get in between us We like catching a feeling Right up on your bumper, baby I know where you're from, this lady I love how you dip and go down, babe I know you're not easy Long time I've been waiting for you I have something for you When it's time to leave in the morning And you feel for somebody You could come and look for me If you want a jam well then call me As the luck of the DJ At the end of the party It's when she look and she tell me She tell me I yours baby So let me ease out the tension.
