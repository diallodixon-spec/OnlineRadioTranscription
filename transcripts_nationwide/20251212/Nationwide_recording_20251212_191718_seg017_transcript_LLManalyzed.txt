20251212 191718 Welcome back, welcome back, welcome back. Top of the evening to you. Welcome. Thank you so much for sticking and staying with us right here inside this TGI edition of Nationwide at Five, the flagship program, the real big show on Nationwide 90 FM. Yeah. Good evening to you. If you're listening on the 90 FM band, 90.3, 90.5, 90.7, 90.9, and of course, to our growing environment community over there on YouTube. We were supposed to make contact with Stuart Jacobs. He's the president of the National Parent Teacher Association in the cover story. Because of some technical challenges, we weren't able to make a contact with Stuart Jacobs, you heard.
