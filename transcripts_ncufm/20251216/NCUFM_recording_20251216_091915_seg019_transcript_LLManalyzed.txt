He provides shepherds and shepherdesses, voices, servants, leaders who walk in his heart the promise forward. This is not an ending, it's a continuation of God's faithfulness.

He is the God who ensures that his Word, his wisdom, and his care will never, ever fail. So let us hold fast to this prophecy.
