20251230 103227 My friend, if you are depressed, if you are confused, if you feel you have been cheated, if you feel as if your back is against the wall, if you are being persecuted for righteousness sake, and you feel like giving up, my friend, Jesus cares for for you He loves you with an everlasting love Don't give up my friend Even though the world is rough Hallelujah
