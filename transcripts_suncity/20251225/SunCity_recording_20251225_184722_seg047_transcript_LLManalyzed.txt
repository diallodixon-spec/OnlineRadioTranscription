20251225 184722 There's no need to talk I see the look in your eyes and I got the truth And there are no lies on your body As I see you undressed I just wanna get the truth Open my door Just come on into the room I've been lying in my bed in the dark all alone And I've been waiting, I've been waiting for you There's been no reason to move It's been as still as a tomb I needed you all so badly tonight But I guess you had better things to do I should have known that it was coming in this way
