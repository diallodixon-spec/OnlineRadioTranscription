just to God be the glory but when I go down there when you're driving or pass on petrol station wherever you drive the long lines you see well this is in the first week like the immediate aftermath I think people waiting to buy petrol with them container and people stand up a standpipe or little water source on the side. I go over one, call boat. They catch water. There wasn't any water in the standpipe. There was a lot of water around. Since I've not, I don't even remember them from my childhood and when I saw I thought wow. Look where we are. Yeah. You're now left to fight mosquito and tadpole. I heard about the tadpole.
