20251226 135144 We love and go be sleeping without you I need somebody to know Somebody to hear Somebody to have Just to know how it feels It's easy to say But it's never the same I guess I kinda like the way you help me escape Now the day bleeds intofall, and you know he is You give me fruit of a love we've got now And then you pull the rug I was scared it could've used to be someone you loved I tried to close my eyes, but it hurts Sometimes I fall into your arms I'll be safe in your soul till I go back home From all the damage, intonation for you You know he is, he get me through it all
