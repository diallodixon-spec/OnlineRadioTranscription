20251229 110103 Give me that love. If you give me me, I'm not going to let go. Give me, make a girl my sample. Feelings got me hitting on the freaky dance floor. Make you give you my love So many people won't lick my skews, so baby, chew me, cause I'll be your tooth. And if I undo your two by two, you fit to scream, you can lose in your pool. So many reasons are written in the stars, oh my god, you're the reason I do what I do. So baby, make you give me your love. Make you give me that.
