colleagues from other universities. Dr. Maine, is this indicative of collaborative efforts, a recognition that we must have core competencies no matter the university that one attends in this country? Absolutely. We have varying scholars and practitioners in Kivett that contributed to the book. So we are the editors. We also have chapters in the book. But the chapters, you know, from these practitioners, they cover, for example, the early development of TVET in Jamaica, TVET rationalization in secondary schools, TVET policy development and implementation, workforce training, readiness, non-traditional skills, training for career development, so a number of areas. So these persons have expertise, so it's very good to collaborate so we can show, you know, on a broad perspective what is happening with TVET itself in terms of its thinking.
