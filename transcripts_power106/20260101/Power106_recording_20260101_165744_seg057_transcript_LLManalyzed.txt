20260101 165744 Since we've got this precious feeling We've gotta keep it coming Slay God through the back door In the same old childish ways Pretend we've never known each other Let's kill this place Hide your fear, come here The sweetness of a gift so dear Like Romeo may love too Sweetheart, we'll take the chance We'll make love tonight, oh yeah. Life can transform by love, we'll make love tonight.
