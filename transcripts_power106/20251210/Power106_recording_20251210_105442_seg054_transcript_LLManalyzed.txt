5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 years, if nothing changes, you are going to have a serious problem. Now, I know all over the place that I don't have much time. Let me tell you though, where we are now in terms of the questions I asked yesterday, the type of economy, I would suggest to all the persons in government to try to understand the role of government and try to be accountable to the people. Why that is important, again, you get three terms out of the things, right? Eat enough food now, try to do something for the people. That's my opinion, firm, straightforward. Do the work now, because where we are right now, that job is not being done. We are wasting time. You are in a space now where you are investing, in my view, in the wrong areas. You have not even invested in civics because you don't want the people to know what they need to do. And those are things that people need to know. They need to know what they are going to do.
