2025-12-11 22:54:21 We came here to run, hey! Run, hey, run, hey! Uh-huh. Just like fire, burning up the way. If I can light the world up for just one day. Watch this madness, beautiful charade. No one can be just like me anyway. Just like magic, I'll be flying free. I'ma disappear when they come for me. People like to laugh at you cuz they are all the same. See, I would rather we just go a different way than play the game. And no matter the weather, we can do it better. You and me together forever and ever.
