For an entire year, I didn't interact with anyone, but my mom, Uncle Patrick, I didn't go to school because I'd already finished high school, but I couldn't get into college. I spent that year, which also was a pivotal point, and reinforced why I needed to work hard and do well, because that feeling was also not a very good feeling of, you know, it felt kind of isolating and, you know, very challenging to sort of get through that spot.
