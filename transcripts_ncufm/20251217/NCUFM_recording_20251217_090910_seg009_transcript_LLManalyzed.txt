20251217 090910 Carmen in Portmore, how are you? Where are you? Don't see you. Good morning, Carmen. Lady Denise Alexander, Probably in Transit. Good morning. So yes, on our cruise compass today, it is International Contemporary Wednesday, so that is soothing music to boil your spirits, inspiring messages to keep your float, and varying features all pointing to the master of the seas. Today's promised to be smooth sailing until we dock in port at 1 o'clock. Full tilt, cruising starts right now. Good morning!
