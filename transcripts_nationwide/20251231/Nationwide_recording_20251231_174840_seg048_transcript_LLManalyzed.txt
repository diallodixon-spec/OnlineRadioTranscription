I'm fine, thank you. I'm trying to unwind and see how I can enjoy unwinding over the next few weeks. Before I go back, Let me look forward. What do you plan to do in retirement? Well, you know, I really have a great belief in God and Whatever he will but if truth be told I have been approached by several international agencies and I've just asked them just to give me a few weeks to exhale before they seek to engage me in respect of consultations.
