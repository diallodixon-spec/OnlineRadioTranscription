20251231 102518 I'm not hearing a billboard. What do you say about opposition? You hear me? No, I'm not hearing you well at all. Your line is bad. You say Christmas one? No, no, no. You're lying not bad. Oh, do you hear me? Yes, much better. Okay. I am saying, I hope you did too for that wonderful reason that Christmas called you to yesterday with your position leader. Why? Because he did very well.
