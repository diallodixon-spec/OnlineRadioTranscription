I feel a change, I am not the same as I used to be Ever since the day you came my way Now little darling, is shinin', it's the start of a brand new day You'll be forever lovers, there will be no other Oh no, not in this world, I'll be your man Girl, you know you're my only one Ever since you gave your love to me Baby, I wanna give my love to you I would like to be alone with you Doing the things that true love do The night is young and the feeling is new Let's break away from our time
