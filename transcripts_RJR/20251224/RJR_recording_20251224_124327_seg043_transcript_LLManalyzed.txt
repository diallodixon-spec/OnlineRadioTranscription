20251224 124327 Alright, makes sense. So, any quick decision making tool you can share with us now? Absolutely. Now, you know, Christians sometimes use the term WWJD, what would Jesus do before they make a decision? Well, in this aspect, the January test is what we'll be using. You can ask yourself, will the January me be comfortable with this decision? Yes. So if the answer is no, then it means that you need to cancel that plan. You can adjust, you know, smaller portions or one less swipe. But that single question can save you months of stress because when that, when the bills start rolling in, in January, nine times out of ten, we are not able to close it or clear it in January, but it spills over into the other months. So you want to avoid the stress, the unnecessary stress.
