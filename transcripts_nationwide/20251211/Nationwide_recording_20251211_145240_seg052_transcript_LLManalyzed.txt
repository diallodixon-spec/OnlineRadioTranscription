Go here with style and next door a man Give them spent but wash them off Skills they didn't use for them just a dance Some job like this but Shake off your one life, your one name Turn off your bag, then send you free hang This one corner makes up one line One night, one night, one night One bar, one bar, go see KC, it's a-ha But I cook everything I see my don't Wish I sleep with the old, rough and the long And that I mix up the apple and the plum Make sure you're fit and ready when you come I'm like a liar, this is why I can't don't And if you ever make a mistake, I'll be wrong But you're pulling at my door
