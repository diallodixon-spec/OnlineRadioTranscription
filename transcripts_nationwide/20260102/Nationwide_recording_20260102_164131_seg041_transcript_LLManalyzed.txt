20260102 164131 But it's really Friday. It's not a Monday. So we are gonna be doing 26 questions to celebrate the start of the year 2026 But before we get into it, we do have one more hot topic I want to get into now Is it a big deal if you turn up to an event and many other attendees were in the same outfit?
