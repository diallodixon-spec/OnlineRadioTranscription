20251231 215827 And if you're thirsty, I will quench you with my love And if you're hungry, I will feed you with my word And all I ask of you is that you love as I do. And if you lose your way, I'll lead you to my love. From a sinful life, I'll dance you in my love. For creation bears a weakness of my love. I know that you should know it's time for the world to try that love. The only love that can replace it. Try that love. So won't you try, try that love.
