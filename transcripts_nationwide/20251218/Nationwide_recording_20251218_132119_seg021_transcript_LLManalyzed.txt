20251218 132119 I'm the one who loves you I must confess you're not to be blamed For being caught in those boys vicious games This time I won't let you go back Never again, my dear, in fact I'm going to stop the blueless you. Also confess what my heart wants to do. That I'm the one who loves you. Find yourself another girl Who will love you, true, true, true Find yourself another girl Save a loving kiss that's just for you Save a loving kisses just for you
