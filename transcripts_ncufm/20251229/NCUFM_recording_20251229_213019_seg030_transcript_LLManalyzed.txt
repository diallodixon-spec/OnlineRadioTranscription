20251229 213019 NCUFM now presents Power in This Page, the Bible in Chronological Order. Warm welcome back to Power in This Page, where every day we are refreshed by the reading of a chapter from the Word of God. This is Liseth Martin. Please pray with me. Lord, mighty in battle, we take the shield of faith. Quench for us all the fiery darts of the devil. We pray in Jesus' name. Amen.
