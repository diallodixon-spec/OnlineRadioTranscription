20251229 185642 Jesus gives me courage There's comfort in His name In Him I find salvation And I'll never be the same I know there's peace Peace where He went To me, to keep my heart and soul from hell. When the morning comes, I'll be heavenward bound. For only in his presence can His peace be found.
