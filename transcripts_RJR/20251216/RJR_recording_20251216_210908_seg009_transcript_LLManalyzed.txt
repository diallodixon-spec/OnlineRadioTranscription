20251216 210908 at Rated Jamaica, we are still trying to come to terms with that. And I just want to express condolences to all affected by that. Never easy to deal with that. And he wasn't here for a very long time at the station, but made a significant impact and had a legacy. So condolences once again. On a happier note, I want to extend belated birthday greetings to Patricia Smith, who celebrated her birthday yesterday. So happy to you and then I want to have a quick word with one of my guests this evening he's not here for the main issue his name is mr. Cian Barnes
