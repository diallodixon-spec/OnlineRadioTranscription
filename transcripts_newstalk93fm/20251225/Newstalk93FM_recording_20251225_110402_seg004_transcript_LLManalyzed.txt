20251225 110402 I only need your house address If you wanna pull up with my tape cassette a seat. I'll put it wider than the internet. I'm a presidential liberal, so fail to look. I need you now, now. Put me on fire like a lantern. Can you taste what's over here? And I wonder why you so, so, so... Sensational. What can I do for you, girl? Can I do for you? Can I do what I do when I don't love you? Love like a riddle, yeah. Give me the clues, give me. Oh, I, I, I laugh just a little, yeah. Life's pretty sweet, can't be better, sensational.
