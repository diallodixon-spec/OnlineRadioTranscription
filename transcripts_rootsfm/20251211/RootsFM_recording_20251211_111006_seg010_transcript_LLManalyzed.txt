I could say, and it depends on how the senior officer feels about you as a police, because if I say I need a recommendation from a senior officer to say that so and so. And they would say to me, write it, because I would know you as a person. So I would know what I want to write, and I am recommending you. So the senior officer, yes, they can do that. So it is important that we recognize our role and function when we're asking for some things that we have to play a part to. Right, so that's why you're making the recommendation that persons need to get close to the police. Get to know even two police in your community. Even one. So you can't go to the one there and say you can give me a recommendation. You know how much time I'm at the station and the person asks me to write a recommendation. I can't write that. How do I write that? And I explain to them, you know. So I said to them, all right, do you know what a recommendation is?
