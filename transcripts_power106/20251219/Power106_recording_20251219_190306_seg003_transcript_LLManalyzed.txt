20251219 190306 will continue to receive aid through the Christmas period and beyond. We have persons in the Eastern corridor who depend on that gift that we give them at Christmas. And now we are looking at how do we balance it? I know that many of them would not mind sacrificing their parcel this year for the greater good of those who are suffering in the West, but there are some who need it. So we are thinking of having a distribution here. We are asking corporate Jamaica, whilst we are looking at the West, that we will be happy to receive their contribution in whatever form so that we will be able to help our brothers and sisters this year. We will receive non-perishable items as gifts, people who wish to drive to our place at 174 Orange Street. We are open from Sunday to Sunday. Those who also want to send us money by transfer, we can provide them with our account. We will be very grateful to corporate Jamaican individuals to come on board with us at this time. Our contact numbers are 922-6764.
