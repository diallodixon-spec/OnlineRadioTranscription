Hi, I hope you're great I think it's time we took a break So I can grow emotionally That's what he said to me Here we go again, crying in bed What a familiar feeling, all my friends in love And I'm the one they call for a third wheel And Brock, they should have guessed, he's like the rest So fun and so deceiving. There's nobody, son, not anyone left for me to believe in.
