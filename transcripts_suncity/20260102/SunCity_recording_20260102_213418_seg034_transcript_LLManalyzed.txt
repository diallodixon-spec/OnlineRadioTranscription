They are encouraging our teachers and our staff members to continue working hard to build their country and to build the education system at large. We are extremely grateful for the contributions and we continue to get the same sponsors year in year out and we would wish now that our network would be widened so more persons will hear about Friends of Region 6 Minister of Education and the work that we are doing as it relates to uplifting the education system. That's it for this feature. Thanks so much for tuning in and we invite you to log on to JIS.
