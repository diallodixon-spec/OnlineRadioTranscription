20251215 110303 There's an outpouring of sorrow for director Rob Reiner and his wife Michelle Singer Reiner. News reports cite a Reiner family statement that says the couple are dead. Los Angeles police are investigating this case as a potential homicide. The daughter of Hong Kong publisher and activist Jimmy Lai says she was not surprised when a national security court found him guilty today. She's still hoping her father will be released soon. MPS Emily Fang reports. Claire Lai says her father is an ailing 78-year-old, and he's seen a precipitous decline in health over the last years of his five-year imprisonment so far. He has heart issues, he has skin problems, he has infections, back issues, waist problems. The lead judge in his case said Lai harbored, quote, resentment and hatred towards China, which his daughter denies. When you're guided by the Holy Spirit, despite what the judgment says, there is no room for hate and there is no hate in my father's heart. Coming from a family of devout Catholics, the younger Lai says she has faith.
