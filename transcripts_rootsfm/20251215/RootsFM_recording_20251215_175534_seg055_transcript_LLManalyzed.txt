I am losing my control Every time you pass my way I'm going crazy every day The thinner of a trickshot Knocked me off my feet The thinner of the trickshot And I just got to be discreet Cause every man's got their eyes on you Tryna get a chance at your love I heard them talkin' that you're the best thing in town And thought I gotta let you know, yeah Center of attraction You knocked me off my feet Center of attraction You know I've gotta be discreet
