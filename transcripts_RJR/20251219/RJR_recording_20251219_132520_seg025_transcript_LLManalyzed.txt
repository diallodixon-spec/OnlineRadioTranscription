Bring some hygiene items. Bring some baby essentials. Bring some non-perishables. So, when you're passing Fesco, and look, if you're not bring it with you, you know, it's self and the compound. So, if you come and you're fueling up and you say, listen, I feel like I want to leave some non perishables. It's a holiday time and I want to do something for families in Jamaica. You can just run inside, grab something, come right back out, donate, donate, donate. So, school supplies, hygiene items baby essentials, non-perishables. We've been here since 10 a.m. We're gonna be here until 5 p.m. This is what we call community in action. Out of many, one people helping each other.
