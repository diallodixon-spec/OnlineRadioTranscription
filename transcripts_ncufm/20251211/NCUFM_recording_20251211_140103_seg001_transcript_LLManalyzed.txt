Mubay once in their last five meetings, but Mubay's last two wins in the matchup were both narrow 1-0 results. Elsewhere, Mount Pleasant FA host a surge in Tivoli Gardens at Drax Hall at 3pm, while defending champions Cavalier face Maligns United at Jerusalem at 5.30pm. Despite dominating the Caribbean Cup and ranking number one in the region, Mount Pleasant have yet to find consistent league form and were held 0-0 by Dumbo-Hodin on Sunday. Meanwhile, Tivoli have shaken off a slow start 66 to give the visitors a strong platform, and the Westinese were cruising at 153 for three, but a collapse of seven wickets for just 52 seconds.
