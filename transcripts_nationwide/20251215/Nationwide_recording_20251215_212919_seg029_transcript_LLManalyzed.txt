20251215 212919 Love isn't the best place to find the lovers So the bar is where I go Me and my friends at the table doing shots Turn him, turn him off! I'm singing like girl, you know I want your love Love was handmade for some battle like me Come and now follow my lead I may be crazy, don't mind you say boy It's the station that rules the nation It's the station you have on my waist and put that body on me Coming now follow my lead Come, coming now follow my lead
