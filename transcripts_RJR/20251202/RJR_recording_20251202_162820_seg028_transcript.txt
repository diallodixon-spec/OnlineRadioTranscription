Keep some falling in love. I keep some falling in love, baby. Keep some fallin' in love. That's, that's why I love him. He's my guy. I love him, he's so fine. And if you ask me why I want him, I can't lie. I still believe in it failed feel it or not. No strings attached, tongue out. We a shell top. They run DMC walls. What's loving you? Big fours and G4s. Y'all parties out on Capri shores. Ain't from Maryland, but I think we could be more of an item. Signs white for my Iceland. Trust me, ain't nothing like it. Those times I was in.
