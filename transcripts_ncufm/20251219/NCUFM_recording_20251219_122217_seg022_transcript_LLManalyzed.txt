20251219 122217 Perfect. Thank you so much for sharing this with us, Mrs. Charlene. Sales, I am sure it will be a hit and the, you know, our brothers and sisters in the West will really, really benefit. Thank you. So much. You're most welcome. Alrighty. Now take care and have a great, great Sabbath. Can I, can I, can I squeeze in one more thing before I go? Sure. I just wanted to give a very big shout out to a few persons in terms of those who have really lent a hand in making this assignment a reality. One of those persons is Jewel Osborne. She is the owner of J4Life apparel. She came on board as a sponsor with the t-shirts that some of the team members will be making. So I wanted to say thanks to her. A very big thank you as well to the EJC team because they have been mobilizing like once I hit the ground running it was just over after that everybody just all hands on deck so very big thanks to EJC President Walker particularly Ruth Hutton she has been very instrumental in the process since
