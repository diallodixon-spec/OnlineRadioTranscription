20251230 133022 I'm feeling vibes on vibes I'm taking dynamite I blow your condolences You know I'm just that type No, they don't figure my vibe They don't figure my vibes You don't figure you, you don't figure you You don't figure your vibe I see you watching my stories I see you getting my lifestyle I see you gaging my lifestyle I see you watchin' my movements This bad, bad every day I know the look on your face Bad man, bad every day Get down on your knees and pray Till you regain your faith Do you dig in your pain? Fight your life.
