20251224 212927 Now don't go out there. Do you have water now? Sir? Did you get water in the area? You're not coming clear, Dr. Douma? I'm saying, don't have the catchment with the tank. They still don't work on it yet, the parish tank. I don't know what they would wait in there. Because after this rain, we may suffer for water again because they don't work on the parish tank. To break it out, that's totally watered after the mass. You have light?
