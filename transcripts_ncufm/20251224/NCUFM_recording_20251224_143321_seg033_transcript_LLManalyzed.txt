But Jesus' promise reminds us that we are never truly abandoned, even when we cannot sense Him necessarily. He's near. This kind of friendship brings comfort and courage, knowing that Christ walks with us and gives us strength to face uncertainty and fear with confidence taking faithful steps forward. So rest assured that Jesus isn't watching from a distance, he is walking beside you through every season.
