The OUR advises a customer who is not severely affected by Hurricane Melissa but is having challenges receiving water. Welcome back. I'm Nicole Morgan-McKean work and my clothes are piling up. How soon can I get back my water from the National Water Commission? Thank you for reaching out. I'm sorry you're going through this, especially with your daily routine being affected.
