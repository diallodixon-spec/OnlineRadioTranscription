I'm telling you please don't touch me But don't put you to watch me He don't like ugly So tell them give their eyes on me People don't know yet, but they won't judge you They're talking about you Must be something about you Smiling your face and talking you bad And making up things that fall from the fast While you're talking and talking and talking about me I'll be pressing on pressing on doing my thing I'm telling you please don't touch me But don't put you to watch me Heed all I can glee so tell them keep them right
