20251231 104019 My mama just got me with tears in her eyes She never knew me have a stage show tonight Not even she see the faves in my eyes But me just a go and put on the show Cause they don't know, yeah They don't know They see me smile But they don't know what I feel inside Only you know Only I know, darling They see me smile, but they don't know What I feel inside In the boiling sun, putting it on the street. Righteous music, me putting it on the beat. But nothing's righteous about how life's set. If you don't know hard life, then you don't know life yet. But call me papa, just call me poverty, make him a screw. Him never know.
