============================================================

Be so ungrateful after all that God has done for you. And how can you be so unruly knowing He controls your destiny? Out of love and grace, He gave us life that we can live But we don't appreciate love So we'll live in hatred and lunge No love It was ordained for us to live in peace Life to hate each other living like this Why do we fight every day, not living the fight
