20251224 162712 You're supposed to, you're supposed to know John Blacks, you know John Blacks? Selector John Blacks? Oh gosh man. Strictly Souls and them things, I remember. Bad, bad DJ. Bad, bad Souls DJ, bad, bad Souls DJ. But even John Blacks had all the cool Lovers Rock segment dropping and everything. Yeah man, he plays Lovers Rock as well. Yeah man he does. Man like Alonzo Arc used to play some wicked Lovers Rock too. Yes man, yeah man. Crazy Chris and Wilt and Irie and them man. Yeah man, so. I just see younger, the younger DJs don't believe reggae must be played, but they veteran them, the man who set it. Yeah man, they play lovers rap man. They will learn from it. Well, hopefully we have younger DJs who tune in and listen to those more experienced DJs and learn from them. My age group, yeah man, we learn from the elders, man. And that's why they're still doing big things right now. Still getting crazy bookings. True, true, true. Max, what's the plan for later though? Grand Market?
