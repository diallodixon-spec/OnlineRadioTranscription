20251218 141109 Have you ever had curry the egg? Good afternoon to my sister Grace from Cumberland. Grace says yes man. Back'am. Back in the country days, my mom used to curry the pork. Tastes so nice. Curry the pork. We need to know, folks, what are some of the other unexpected things that, from Irma, you've had or seen curried? But I sing glory, glory, hallelujah, that to give thanks and praise unto the Father, a long time I'm on my way.
