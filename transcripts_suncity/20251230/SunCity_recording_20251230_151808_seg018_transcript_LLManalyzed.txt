20251230 151808 with a different Sun City 104.9 FM. I am a Sun Jack Ali Patch. I'll be giving you a proper dose of music. Nothing but nice vibes, conscious vibes like this song from Basie Signal. Gonna keep it very, very, very upbeat and energetic. Shout out to my bro Chris Sonic, what a piece of vibes. Yeah man, Chris Sonic is always bringing the scorching vibes right here on Sun City. Later on at 7.30, Sun Jack Wicked Foot will be in the building. We got an interview lined up for you as well. That will be conducted by Queen Jojo. I got some tickets to give away as well, phone cards.
