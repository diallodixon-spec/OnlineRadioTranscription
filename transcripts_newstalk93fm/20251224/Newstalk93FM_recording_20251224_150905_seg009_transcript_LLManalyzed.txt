20251224 150905 We've been waiting Call me stubborn But I can't get over it You left and never Say goodbye Those tears I cried No, I can't get it over it So don't you ever Let me down again Cause I'm depending on you So you better come through this time, please hear my cry I need you back in my life. Look at people by the truck. Emotions running high. We are not in the sky.
