When I used to write my father, you know, in the early part of the, you know, when I was much younger, when he replied, he would say, I look between the line. I never knew what that mean until after that time. When I was doing human growth and development, family life, family planning, I was told that we must look outside the box to get things. If you wanted to draw a straight line, sometimes you have to draw it outside the box. So what I'm saying to many of us Jamaican-African, make us take time out to look between the lines or outside the box. Because we cannot, you cannot born on a Tuesday and you tell me say Wednesday is my birthday and I'm never born on a Wednesday. I born on a Tuesday so I always look the closest Tuesday to the 22nd like this. So I say I celebrate the two days.
