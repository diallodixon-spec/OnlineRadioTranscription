20251225 153525 Oh, yeah. Sleigh bells ring. Are you listening? In the land. Snow is glistening. A beautiful sight. We're happy tonight. Walking in the winter wonderland. Going away is a bluebird. Here to stay is a new bird. Singing a song as we go along. Walking in a wind toward the land in the middle we can build a snowman then pretend that he's a circus town we'll have a lot of fun with the snowman until the other kids all come down when it's snow, ain't it friendly? tonight you know, it's the chilly. We finally play the Eskimo way. Walking in the winter wonderland. Sleigh bells ring, are you listening? In the land, snow is glistening. A beautiful sight we're having tonight.
