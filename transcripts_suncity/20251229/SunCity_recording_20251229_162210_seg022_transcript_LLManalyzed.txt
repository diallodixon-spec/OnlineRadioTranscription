So don't mess with me, When I was born in my birth suit The doctor slapped my behind He said you're gonna be best shown You sweet little tutu Now you can look as much But if you're much in touch You're gonna have yourself a face. I'm gonna break your face. So don't mess with my doo-doo, son. Don't mess with my two-doo. I know you have another woman. So don't ask for my doo-doo. Yeah, you're right.
