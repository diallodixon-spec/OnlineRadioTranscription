20251229 180504 And when I make it in a life, hungry days could never be the thing for mama. And when I make in a life, all of the good things I bring for mama. I feel the things when I see her go through, when I sing that song, yeah. Mama never left, none of the whip on the doorstep. She hustled in the street and she pours sweat. Looking at mama's eyes and you know stress. And no help from daddy mama don't get. Yes. Mama tell me say me is a star from young She tell me see a me a go bring mine from the gun She say son write music stay far from the good Nobody couldn't do for me what my mama done When she bring me come a heard me the valks are free come So anything she ask me fall shall be done When me look in her eye me say mama don't cry
