20251229 093729 I don't lose my composure, cause me losing control, giving me more than I need, everything where you got it for party, even if what I got in me pay pay, no fee to device, you my old reggae, my rhythm, my blues, my activity, everything from Monday to Sunday, say you be my gold, my silver, not everything I go do for money, So many things you did do, nobody do me like you do. My music and my music, everything my baby. My rhythm and blues, so many things you did do, nobody do. You play happy to lose, carry my love, put it all on you.
