While this other one, it just cruises over because you have so much torque and horsepower, you just cruise over the hill and you're gone, you know, to deliver what you have. This can be measured in any way you want to measure it, Shelley. This is how the engineers measure efficiency. We are getting more power, but for the same amount of load, just as we want to use load, for the same amount load, we're getting more power out of this vehicle to do the same amount of work, right? And you can now calculate that by time. I am now half an hour, an hour ahead of you. I delivered the goods one hour ahead of you, still struggling to get there. That is how we deliver it. That's how we measure the efficiency in these things. So when you're looking at that.
