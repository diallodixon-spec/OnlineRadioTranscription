20251215 135242 Heaven, right here with me. Somebody can take it away. Someone so sweet to call my baby. Shaggy! Girl I can't fight this feeling It feels so right Champagne and candlelight The way you hold me tight Girl I can't find this feeling Oh no Oh man, you're nice Smile from your face, it's like you're right above me
