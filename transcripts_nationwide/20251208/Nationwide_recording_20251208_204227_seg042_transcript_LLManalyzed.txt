I didn't pay you no mind. Nationwide, my dear friend. They must have been blind. But I could tell from the start you had love in your heart. And you wanted so much to let it go, baby. You needed the chance to show little romance. Now the table is turned, they're running you down, baby Show it all, show them what you got now honey Throw it all, throw them cause you're hot now, hot now Every man's got their eyes on you Tryna get a chance at your love Higher than seas if you're talking down That's why I gotta tell you
