20260101 175436 I don't really need to look very much further. I don't want to have to go where you don't follow. I'm holding back again this passion inside. I can't run from myself. There's nowhere to hide. You're the love I remember forever. But don't make me close one more door. I don't want to hurt anymore. Stay in my arms if you dare. I must start imagining you there. Don't walk away from me I have nothing, nothing, nothing to beg me for
