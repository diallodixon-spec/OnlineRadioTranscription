20260101 122617 If we stopped seeing each other If you had only met me first When you were free Cause now you've got commitments I should not expect things from you That you can't give to me Oh but baby, can't you see? I can't say goodbye to you. No matter how I try, you're such a part of me. Without you, I would die deep in the heart of me. I know that you and I were meant to be forever I can't tell you goodbye
