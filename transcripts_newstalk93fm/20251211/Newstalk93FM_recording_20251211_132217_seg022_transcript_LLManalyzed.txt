============================================================

Whenever you are, girl, that's where I call my own Whenever you doubt it, I'll be letting you know I want to be dancing with you forever You see through the storm and take me as I am Baby, it's magic anytime that we're together I make I just love you and hold you for the bread. I'm going to put the bread in the oven and bake it in. Feelings I've been holding in, it must be love. Whenever I'm broken, you make me feel whole.
