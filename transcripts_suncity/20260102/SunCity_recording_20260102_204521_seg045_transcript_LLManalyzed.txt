20260102 204521 and leave you behind. I can't waste time talking in a moment. I realize nothing's broken. No need to worry about everything I've done. Live every second like it was my last one. Don't look back at a new direction. I loved you once, needed protection. You're still a part of everything I do. You're on my heart just like a tattoo No matter what you say about love I keep coming back for more Keep my hand in the fire
