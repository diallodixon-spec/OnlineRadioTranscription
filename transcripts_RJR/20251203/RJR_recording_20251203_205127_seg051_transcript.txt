You have a few hold on with you so we take a limp on the street. We never pass them Send me all of them our grandma respect the lady them send me the mothers and the auntie daughter them send me the niece and all the sister them The woman a call me when you're there the woman a call me When you're there. I'm there in the studio. You're too loud. Please believe me. Why y'all know? Me a make some music life to y'all and I'm breaking a collar From me up there, they got lemon on my eyes And they make me realize, I'm in a feature style Y'all know I don't make no noise When I step up on your thighs I just do it in your bust, make me reach to the skies Them crocs are mostly blind, look on your love in love in a line. How them girls, they all whine, and now we glue your slime. Me and no grinds, man, nah, me no Joe grind. Me cell phone a ring, so me run out of time. Me woman a call me. Where you at? Me woman a call, me. Where ya at? Me there in the studio. You're too alive. Please believe me.
