20251216 161108 so you better come through this time please hear my cry and if I ever let you down my friend it was a misunderstanding so I thought you'd get forgotten you're not promised from today I go jump like I never jump wave like I never wave fly like I never wanted to just to show you a summer, a summer and I need you back in my life Look at people by the truck Emotions running high We are not in the sky Death running down we hide Can't you tell that we sorry? We sorry And we need you back and we're high and we need you back Come on to me, come on to me Come on to me High, high inside no place like home
