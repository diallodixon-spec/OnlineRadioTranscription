as humble as a lamb working towards the goal and we give thanks for helping hands pray for health and spent a life of length and peace of mind good people and good vibes we give thanks every time in every single line even if it ain't rhyme I'll go sing redemption songs to the people when I think of where I'm coming from looking back at where the journey begun I really have to say that I'm strong. I'm strong. All praises to the most I want. Look at where I'm strong, I'm strong All praises to the most I want Make me tell you about the life of a queen in a this-year-concrete jungle Firm in a regime so you're not gonna see me stumble Mama said no, come on down and mix with us, you won't go see Then now me just a-rise and summarize and summe humble Haunt a Christian and yes, me love go live
