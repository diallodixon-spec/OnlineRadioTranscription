The ruling stems from a Facebook video posted in May 2023. Frederick argued that the video severely damaged his personal and political reputation. He sought damages and an injunction. The matter drew widespread public attention since Frederick was then Minister for Housing and Chastity was opposition leader. In its ruling the court found that Chastity's statements were based on assumption rather than facts and that he failed to provide any evidence to support allegations.
