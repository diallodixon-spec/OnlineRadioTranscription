Keep those hands up Go up in the club and listen up about the band Everybody get worked, and I go down the wing and I go down to flank like the gang, play it welcome Just dance, just dance, let me see you show you how I dance It's getting hot in the club, millions of females packing the club Bouncing to reggae and hip hop in the club, don't forget a little roots rock Oh I dance, it's getting hot in this place, feel all the bassline top in the face, watch over the girls, directing their way, straight back till I'm all in. Don't fight against your brother, no no no way, don't fight against your sister, you're not gonna fit in no way.
