20251231 130806 Don't worry about it Don't you know that things are gonna change Oh, but you gotta be a man You gotta take a stand Don't ever feel like Like you can't make it, baby It's like, too late It's nothing you can say could tear me away from my God It's nothing you could do cause I'm stuck like glue The tune's right on. Stick together, I'll tell you from the start I can't be turned apart from my guy There's nothing you can do could make me untrue to my guy My guy! There's nothing you could buy could make me turn alive to my guy
