I love the way that you bring a vibe With your hands them up in the sky Rolling back and having a time See me with me cannibal friend, Lord, me cannibal friend. I wish it come from there. London, I wish it comes from there. New York, I wish it came from there. When you come in, my baby, I wish come from there. Atlanta, she comes from there. Toronto, she come from there. And I know that they miss me.
