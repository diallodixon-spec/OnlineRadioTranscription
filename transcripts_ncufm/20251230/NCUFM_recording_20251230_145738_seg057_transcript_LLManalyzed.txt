20251230 145738 Tracy? Hey, girl, what's up? So hold on. Why you look so vexed this early? They ain't a just that. Lisa, it is so good to see you. But sorry you catch me like this, girl. My uncle sent one by a lot when my family go for creative. You don't want to hear the price the people then put on the something. But matters worse, me hear half of the things they're missing. And I don't sell customs. Girl, how you don't sell customs? At least I stop going like I don't have any sense. You don't see everybody talk about it in the media? You don't want me to stop listening to you say? You ever experience that? Customs don't go in your package, suitcase, barrel or cargo unless you ship the item or the agent stand up right there when they might inspect it. Listen, customs job is to protect the borders, collect revenue and to facilitate trade. They will not collect or store shipment, they will inspect it and somebody else will present it for inspection.
