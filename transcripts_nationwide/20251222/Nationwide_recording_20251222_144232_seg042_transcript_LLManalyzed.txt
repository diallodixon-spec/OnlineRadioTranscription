20251222 144232 You love is life-saving You always get me when I fall It's people just like you and me who pass them in the traffic That never fall in love and some of it seem lucky Enough of them no fortunate enough to have somebody Some just cannot see beyond the flesh and it's so funny Never get too caught up in yourself to feel the magic True love come and pass you by in life it is so tragic Opportunity is grace so take it while you have it Don't wait till you are panicked Well the last man that day we'd make a big mistake Left and gone feel good and miss out something we're great Liar and full of hate when enough of them a move fake How a thing separate we can't separate Cause I would miss you baby And I can't do without you darling Yes and I I know we miss you, baby Girl, you know I love you bad I'm pissed off the pot Yeah, now we broke Give me your arms, follow my heart All I want you to know, woman, your love is the best
