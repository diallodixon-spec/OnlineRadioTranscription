2025-12-11 16:38:23 look until Christmas and the next, see, replace them, not relief, in state specific, replace, and that's why I said, replace and relief are two different things, right? So I need courage and will not be concerned. You see, if I'm wrong, we'll get, we'll be self-reliant, we'll be ashamed. Well, look, all right, let me play devil's a shrink. We'll be 470. The 170 that's here now will continue to work. The only relief that they're getting is the possibly not as many hours of work from like 18 hours to probably cut those down because you'll have 300 more coming. There's no significant relief coming for that 170.
