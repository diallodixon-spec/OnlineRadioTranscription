20260101 171712 Welcome to Music in Place of Beyond the Headlines. I'm Siobhan Iblir, keeping it company all the way until 8 o'clock. Trust you've had a great start to your new year. And here's hoping that 2026 will be bright, will be merry, will be prosperous, and all the things we set out to achieve, we'll accomplish. So all I ask is that you relax, enjoy the offering, and keep me company until 8 o'clock. This is the 94. Happy New Year.
