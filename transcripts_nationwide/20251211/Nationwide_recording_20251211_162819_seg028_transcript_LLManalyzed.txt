2025-12-11 16:37:14 That forces you to act this way Forces you to scream my name Then pretend that you can't stay Tell me who I have to be To To get your ass surprised to see See, no one loves you more than me And no one ever will, no matter how I can't think we grow, you always seem to let me know It ain't working, it ain't working It ain't working And when I try to walk away You hurt yourself to make me stay This is crazy
