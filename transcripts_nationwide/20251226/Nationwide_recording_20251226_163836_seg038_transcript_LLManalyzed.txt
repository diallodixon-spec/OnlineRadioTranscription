20251226 163836 Come and feed me truth to the youth and passion Make me give peace to the blood that is deterioration Blood of the light and of my salvation I have a advice you know, figure out one Christian And come into my church and be in the deep end And teach them what the work of the Almighty One I'll run with them, the one we're full of panication Me never get a bicycle if I ride you down And I preach the word of God and I teach it in the name of Jesus, Salamanda! Come on! Come on, come on, come on! Come on!
