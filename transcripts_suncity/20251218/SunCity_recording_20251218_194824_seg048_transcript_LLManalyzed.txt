20251218 194824 I wanna be half a world away I wish I had wings that I could fly Across all those long and lonely miles But here I am tonight Half a world away In your loving eyes, I see my heart's reflection. You speak to me alone, in a language of our own. We're here together. And I still feel you touching her in the dark Holding on to it is the hardest part for me What would say you were half a world away?
