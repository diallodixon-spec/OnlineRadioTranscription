This one says Good morning someone's points point of view in on points the caller who is calling about the car wash the thing of the water in the road near the stoplight at the Boulevard Amoulin Rouge is speaking the truth. Not until someone, oh good lord, hopefully not Christ, and then they also do something as well. It's come from Carmen and Gregory Barth, and Carmen goes on to say, another thing, sir, the emptying of garbage right at the corner of Copper Drive, near the light post of the former Jehovah's Witness church, or Tabernacle. Not Tabernacle, Jehovah's Witness, not church, right? You have to give way to that. And Kingdom Hall, that's a proper thing, right? It said meet parts and every other thing. So blooming is grace.
