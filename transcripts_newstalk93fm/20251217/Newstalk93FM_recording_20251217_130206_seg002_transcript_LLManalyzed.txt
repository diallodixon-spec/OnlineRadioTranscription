20251217 130206 I know that you miss me I love the way that you bring a vibe With your hands them up in the sky Falling down and up in a time Wine in season again And we have the money to spend And we jammin' down to the end Rolling with me cannibal friend Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Mm, she dreamin' to take a whine on me, cause she comin' down to please. When she rummage, she push it back, all the bambam rollin', and she say them sound for me. I tellin' you, I love whenever you bring a vine, with your hands them up in the sky, what we drunk and havin' a time.
