20251223 102416 Well, you know, the thing about it, you know, is Lucy, and I got a message earlier on, not in relation to so, but to JPS. I am wondering if they are looking at their systems, because computer run out of these things, you know. You see what I'm saying? And if it's an auto, because they should make every effort to ensure that person are not getting billed for what they don't consume. So I saw something I offered somebody in Chilani, where they get a bill. They don't have the power or nothing, get their sick consumption of X amount. So, and the thing about it, we are living at times, you see, Lucy, lucy everybody left on computer there's a computer that good what is there what is the reality but if you know that no service not here you must actually send a bill not go out that the lease must go you know so they just address these things
