I come inside the office and take the jobs and run right up the draft sheet. So what I pray for? I said, music. I said, all right. No bother. Come on.

You know the WhatsApp. If you have any comments or questions, just send them in. We could big up the legend. We're going to take a break here on The Two Life Crew. We were all there with Sly Dunbar and very exciting interview. And we're sharing that with you right now. They had to take a little break. So I'm going to make sure that hold on. Yeah, they had to take a break. So I want to make sure I slide over that break.
