20251216 181309 You come alive with one wine baby With you I want to dance the night away One jam's in a lifetime baby So don't feel away You don't like the fast life They look on the bright side girl I go take the blame. I just want you to come and light it up. Just a little winding up. Come and meet me behind the truck and we rev it up. Whole day. Keep throwing it back at the way you stop. Baby, no way. We could post up all the pictures you want when you're ready. I go over here, darling. You go over there. But we could meet in the middle and start a back-and-all. Play in the middle, hey. What we gonna do now? Jam to a rhythm in the heat. I can't eval, but in the heat, hey.
