20251226 163718 Mary your majesty, demons tremble at the sound of your name. The higher and mighty, the Lord our Lord be. The light shines brighter than the morning sun. The chains of power come, Mary your majesty. Demons tremble at the sounds of your name. Oh Lord, give us all that you are, yes, Lord, you are holy. We give you all that you are.
