20251218 201110 you have four that you cannot be in a space with them if i help one with homework at 8 pm in the evening the other four now have homework too you understand me and that kind of a thing my poor point was if you having five try and see if you can limit the number of baby mothers i'd say one in relation to the number it depends on the structure of the family so if you you have 10, as you know, the reality is in Jamaica history. In the old days, you used to have 10, 11, 12, but it was one father, one mother. And if we're talking about real old time Jamaica, yes, you're going to have 12 within it, but you know, it's a one out of road. Let us be honest. One out of road. My grandmother, I think it was 13 and one passed from earlier. About 13 kids in all and one passed.
