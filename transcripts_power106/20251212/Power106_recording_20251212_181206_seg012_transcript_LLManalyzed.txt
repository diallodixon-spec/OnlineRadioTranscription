20251212 181206 Executed a certain way and they pretty much did that so there is something to take away from this despite the marginal victory Yeah, I think you know in these situations that we've seen these games can always be tricky It's not just a football match you have to deal with its travel its sleep its You know facilities conditions as well things that a lot of people probably don't know that going into play. So, again, for the players to come in the right frame of mind, for the staff, obviously, we were prepared on medical teams, our high-performance team. It's a truly group effort. But overall, we have to take the positives away that we just went out there and executed the game. And there's always stuff to take on. It wasn't a perfect match. As you know, as a coach, right, there's never a perfect team that you play. But I think overall, we were able to look at it and say, all right, this is what we wanted to do. We wanted to play at a certain tempo. Our XG was off the table.
