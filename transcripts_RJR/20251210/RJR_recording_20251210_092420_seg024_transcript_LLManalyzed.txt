That's a word over my brother. Very well said. Thank you, Martin. All right. Duh. So, Sir Taylor, in comedian politics, as usual, then, yeah, everybody does. But so do you, Richie. Everybody in comedian politics, you know. It's just how we, as hosts of this program, have to mitigate it. All right. Not true. All right. Oh, good morning. Thanks to Radio Jamaica. I'm now hearing the station again. I wasn't getting it yesterday. Marie from Chicago says thanks to Mr. Mullings, too. All right, bless up, bless up. Muller, good bedroom. I haven't seen Muller face to face in a while, you know. Muller, I hope you're all right. Yeah. Yeah, I'm all right, of course. Man from Ploaden, remember us here in Ploaden, including the man from Ploaden who is listening to us here. Yeah, man, as usual, enough love. All right, let me see who is here. Good morning, how are you?
