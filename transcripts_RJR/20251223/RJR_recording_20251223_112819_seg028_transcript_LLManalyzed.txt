20251223 112819 We wanted this to look like it was a transaction. We wanted it to be something where we can basically have a symbiotic relationship between the farming community. We are strong on food security. We think if we build Jamaica and build our farmers, we assist in some way. We cannot take over, take all the peppers and time that is produced in Jamaica. There's a local market there, and there are other markets to not own us alone. So we wanted to actually do that to ensure, you know, I said, you know, you know, as someone that is a food safety practitioner, we wanted to ensure that there's continuance in terms of what we do or customers can ensure and continually have the same flavor profile. You know, good thing we were kind of ahead of the game, you know, but it comes to hurricane season every year. We order a little more than what we actually need. It was more a strategic move that we made a couple of years ago. So that has been one thing that has sustained us over this period. We are hoping to have shipments coming in again somewhere mid-January to early February.
