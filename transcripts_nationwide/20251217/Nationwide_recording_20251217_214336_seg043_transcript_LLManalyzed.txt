20251217 214336 I just died a couple of years ago. I mean like 5 years ago. And it's now a tradition in my home. It tastes good man! Like, who invented this? Nice, nice. The Great Depression? No man, ham bone soup is delicious. Is delicious. Is it stressful though to prepare all of these meals? Even if it is that people are still bringing food to the home, but is it stressful for you to... Christmas dinner, how pressuring is it to get the recipe right, to prepare this big wallop of food at once? Is it stressful? Used to be. Then you know, there will be somebody who finds a problem even if it's perfect. So you just cook for yourself. It's not like you even find a problem. I said oh man, you just want like a more sad. But you want like a more courier or something.
