20251231 132617 That's the one gift I did. As comics, we have to question a lot of things we hear and really sift through the argument. And I'm saying, when Jesus, electricity was not around for many years. So how did they worship? And some people never even have a building daily. So where did they worship? Did they go by the river? We revival people and they can't get them used to life. Can't get them life. So we've gotten so modernized now and, you know, we're upscaling the religion. Take it back to be a six man. Take it back. And I feel like if no more than ever, we should be coming together and giving thanks. Absolutely. A lot of people didn't make it to 2026. Especially in the western side. I think you definitely guys need to come together and watch the night together and pray. Yeah thanks for taking us out of this year. Whatever the year may have brought that we are here and once you're here that means you have the capacity to overcome and just pray
