We have Dr. Gail Evering Kerr on the line. She's a program development officer at the Ministry of Health and Wellness to elaborate on this morning's topic. Good morning to you, Dr. Gail. Good morning to your new listeners. How are you doing? I'm doing wonderful. How are you? I'm great. Thank you. Wonderful. Wonderful. Okay. All right. So Dr. Gayle, the first thing that I want to ask, you know, you know, why is discussing prostate cancer so important and what are the main risk factors? Okay, great. So prostate cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer in Jamaica and the Caribbean. Now when we look at the world, lung cancer and breast cancer are actually the leading cause of cancer. But in Jamaica, prostate cancer is the number one.
