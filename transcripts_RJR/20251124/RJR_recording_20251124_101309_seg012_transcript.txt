The road, the Medina road, main road, okay, near to the school. All right, I'm saying, Mr. Taylor, hold on a second. Okay. Okay. I heard you talking about taking off a leaf and washing it. I'm laughing because when I look about cabbage, et cetera, I take off every single leaf and wash it, then put put in some salt because insects will hide inside and they will easily come out and that's it yeah I also use a vegetable brush on the ground provision like the one you know like that's the one I'm not peeling at the carrots it takes time you don't peel carrots oh I have a vegetable peeler not peel my wash out my carrot them and think carrots now are bumpy and you have to shave them off like a manicure before you eat them. No, I buy some carrots and they look like limbs with arthritis.
