20251231 143421 I just say my lane, my lane I don't get the time for the hate and the bad energy Cause my mind on my money Make you dance like broccoli Steady green like broccoli Steady on my grind, don't hear what they want Telling me could be not my fantasy Don't want to check if my tap in the rush But see the rush, see the rush fire well, it be much Now I gotta make my tap, Yeah. Everybody. There's no don't us, there's no darling
