2025-12-12 15:16:30 I've reached high up in the sky, tried to steal the stars Oh, to win your heart But even that's not enough And I researched every book and I just defined the words Oh, touch your world and get some love out of you I've already given all I can give And I don't, I don't know what's let you try And I try, and I try What do I gotta do? Do I gotta get away from the moon? Is that what I gotta do?
