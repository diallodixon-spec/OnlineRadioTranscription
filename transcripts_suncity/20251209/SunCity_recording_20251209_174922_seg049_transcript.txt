Please just rewind let me shake it to the max Oh, you're so fat in your shirt. Oh, you're dealing with the boss? Could I never take a loss? Like a ball, I'll pump up in some fuzz Y'all are what make you so bright Original y'all, some of them are the knack of it, knack of it And if you hear this on the gong and your back, gong and your knees, then you shake it to the max Did you please tell all the plays to the max?
