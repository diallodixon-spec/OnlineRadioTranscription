20251224 160505 I love my culture and love where we from We get these powers from this same nation Sweet like steel drum this with these vibrations Don't let the rhythm get you just run run run run The venue could handle it jammin' But like when the man pull high We gon' rip it up a spine Oh lord oh yeah Goodbyes and party we lovin' Sweet woman we havin' Create this for the planet boy Somebody radio loud playin' a song and it goes in a fuck And if I lose myself inside this place well I show my shit up Empty soca on glass when the bitch across the madness what's up Just give me one more shot inside my glass and watch me level up
