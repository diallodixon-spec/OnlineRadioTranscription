20260101 150605 I think I love you Hey, baby, will I ever do? There's no place I'd ever be. I can't believe that it is true. The things that you do to me. I wouldn't lie to you, baby. I'd never be a coming to you. I'm still in love with you, baby. There's nothing I want to do. I feel for you. I think I love you.
