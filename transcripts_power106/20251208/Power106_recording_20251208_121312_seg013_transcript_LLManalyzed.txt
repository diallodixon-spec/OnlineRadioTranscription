Good afternoon, I'm Christopher Scott and this is your lunchtime sports report and we kick things off with a football. Defending champions Cavalier will be looking to get all three points when they battle league leaders Montego Bay United as the Jamaica Premier League continues to return after the passage of Hurricane Melissa. Cavalier are fourth on 13 points. That match kicks off at 5pm. In the late game Tivoli Gardens will face Waterhouse. That game is scheduled to start at 7.30pm.
