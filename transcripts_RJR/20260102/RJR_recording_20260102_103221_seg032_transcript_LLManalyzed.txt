Black River or downtown Kingston? Did you go to church? Were you at home, reflecting, listening to music? Did you have your quiet party? Were you asleep? Were you watching TV? Were you reading? How did you ring in the New Year? Well, you heard about Switzerland at a resort town where some revelers were in a bar and just after midnight there was a fire and 40 odd persons lost their lives.
