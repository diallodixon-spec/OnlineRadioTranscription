Oh no, don't say that. She did a good drawing, she did a good try. Look. Okay. And the proportions are right. Did you look at this? Did you look at how I did this? Okay. Because I was going to teach you guys how to draw a face. She never go on bad. She even got my mole over my eye and she put like a detail in there. But the proportions are also good. Okay. I used to teach, you know, so maybe, you know, I'm taking credit for that. All right, Ayanna, if folks want to find you, where do they find you? You can find me at asdclothing.com or you can find me on social media ayanna.asd or by asd. Guys, reach out to her. She's an inspiration.
