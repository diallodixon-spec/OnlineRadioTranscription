20251217 164429 Let it be what you've done. Oh Lord, return me to dust. The angels up in the clouds are jealous, know what we've found. Something so heavenly, higher than ecstasy, whenever you're next to me. Oh mama, where was it black and white? Until I saw your light, I thought you had to die to avoid Something so out of the ordinary How are you laying me down to a dead and buried? On the edge of your night Staying drunk on your vine The angels up in the clouds Are jealous knowing we found Something so out, the ordinary. You got me kissing the crowd, sanctuary. Try to meet what you're taught, or God will turn me to dust. The angels up in clouds are jealous knowing what we found.
