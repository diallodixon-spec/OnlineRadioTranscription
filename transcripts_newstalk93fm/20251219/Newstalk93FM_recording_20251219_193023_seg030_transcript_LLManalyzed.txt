20251219 193023 You're listening to Sleek Radio, 93 FM. I love the way that you bring a vibe With your hands them up in the sky Rollin' back and havin' a dime We in Lymane again And we havin' money to spend Yes, we jammin' down to the end See me with me cannibal friend Lord, me cannibal friend Where she comin' from, me? London, where she comin' from me?
