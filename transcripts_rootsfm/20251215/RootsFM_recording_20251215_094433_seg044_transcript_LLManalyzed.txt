20251215 094433 They give in a lot to jokes but me still can't laugh My hood a run way long time if Jamaica was on my heart One of the thing dem where me can't understand is the waft Everything else get stopped but every gun come out All me know is this, yeah Every man a priest but nobody not from church No, no, no, no Dem used to be solid, but now they're recycled like plastic. Why everybody toxic? This is a big show, Aki. Cause all I see is actors and actresses. Yeah. What they use to identify a fool is the mind.
