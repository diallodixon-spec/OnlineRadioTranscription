20251231 154021 Behold the city where Jesus is king Behold the city, where there'll be no more sin I can't wait to see Jesus' face I just can't wait to feel his warm embrace Don't have to beg my best for heaven Don't have to walk ten thousand miles Don't have to pave my way to see Jesus Cause he's right here by my side But all my face is reserved for me The cost of my cry
