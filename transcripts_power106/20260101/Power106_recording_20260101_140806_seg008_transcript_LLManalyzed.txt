20260101 140806 I don't ever give up. In spite of our love, love is much too precious. It's greater than both of us. There's more than enough. I'll keep looking for love. Just be love from zero. It'll get one-to-one. Sky is the limit. If you believe in love, you're in love. Oh Just don't give up on love It didn't work out this time But I turned your lover, girl, I'm so sorry But I never meant to hurt you I'm never meant to break your heart I turned your lover so brokenhearted But I've never meant to break you
