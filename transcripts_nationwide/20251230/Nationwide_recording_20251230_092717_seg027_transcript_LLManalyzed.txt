20251230 092717 Now this one, you can't see any balance. And every time we heard that they are going to fix it, now I hear a lot of people being complaining that they put money in the car, they're finished and they don't know, but I'll say a few things. Last week, I am a teenager, I travel on the bus Mondays to Fridays. I travel on the original bus, which is $75 from a fare. I travel in the evening Mondays to Fridays on the premium, which is $230. So in all for the week, I pay $1,275 per year. Every week, I put $1,500. So at least I have $270 every week.
