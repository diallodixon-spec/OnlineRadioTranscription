20251215 193020 I wanna take you home tonight I wanna come and warm your lonely nights I wanna be wrapped up baby in your arms and I'm holding you so tight I wanna rock you gently till you sleep I wanna be the man that's in your dreams I would be glad just to know that you feel like I feel So just hold me baby like I wanted to from the first day I met you Hold me baby, real tight, the fantasy will fill by the end of the night Hold me baby like I wanted to From the first day I let you hold me baby
