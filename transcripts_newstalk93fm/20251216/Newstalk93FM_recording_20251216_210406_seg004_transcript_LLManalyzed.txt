20251216 210406 When my sound play pictures, lighters in the air. Pupads up in the street. And that's just how it feels when reggae music plays can't help but move your feet pull up the vibe cause the music is sweet yeah singing shaggy, we be killin' the speed, yeah Cause when saturday night reach a nobody no step New clothes, new car, everything trep Bebo say walk in a design a crepe Forward in a shelly bar until no molly come no left Can't just walk full up the blister but I'm the damn secret
