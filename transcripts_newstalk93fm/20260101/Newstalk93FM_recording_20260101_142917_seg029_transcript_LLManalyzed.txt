20260101 142917 I see this fine girl from my party, she wear yellow Every other girl did they do too much but this girl mellow Now you might find situation I could use they tell I'm mellow Finally I find way to talk to the girl but she ain't no one follow Who you gonna phone phone one? Why you no one phone phone one? Then I start to feel a bum bum one But she didn't give me small small one I know, she dry, but for you I can do it now And my hips make you cry when I'm moving around you Do it once, do it twice Heart-patch park, you hold me tight Get a taste for a night Baby, show me you can calm down, calm down Dance with me and take the lead now
