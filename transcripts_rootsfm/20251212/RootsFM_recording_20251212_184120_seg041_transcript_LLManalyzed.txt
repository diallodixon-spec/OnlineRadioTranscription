20251212 184120 I'm glad I didn't turn you down I've watched you all these years Holding your head up high Just wanting to be someone When all the fellows around They didn't pay you no mind How could they not look twice? They must have been blind But I could tell from the start You had love in your heart And you wanted so much To let it go, baby You needed the chance To show little romance Now the table has turned They're running you down, baby Show it off Show them what you got now, honey Throw it off Break them cause you're hot now, baby Let it off
