Don't wanna get caught in your spell. How I make you put me through living hell? Time and time again, when me see you not be party. Get up, stand up and run, the way you put it on me body. How me feel, leave you you're alone and you alone get me so naughty You make me fall in love, you shoulda listened to me charge it Why you make me feel away, my body can't hold me You gave me the fire, now we burn burn baby Look at what you do to me Take over my energy Shoulda know you never good to me I know you make me happy Run run run Run run run You make a good girl happy Run run run
