20251222 091512 I get stuck. I just run out to the store to get some food or to just go to the store. And here it is. We got pulled over. Maybe you forgot to, you know, put on your indicator, right? And the next thing you're stopped and you don't have a valid driver's license. ICE for sure, you're more likely than not, I should say. You're going to have ICE contact. Now you're going to be put in proceedings. And real quick, if you entered with a visiting visa, do not. If ICE, if you come into contact with ICE, please do not let anybody force you to sign any document or a waiver of voluntary departure unless you know exactly what you're doing. They may tell you, oh, no, you won't get to speak with your spouse or your attorney unless you sign this. Next thing you know, you sign it and you're on an explain to Jamaica or wherever you are from so please make an informed decision and tell them no on the advice of council I want to speak with an attorney before I sign anything all right thank you so much for that Opal we are up on the break we're going to take this break when we come back hopefully we can reduce
