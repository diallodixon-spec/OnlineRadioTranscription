I know it's just a phase I'm going through. And every time I start to sleep, I just remind myself I need only think of it. I will do so much better. Say you want to get things back the way they used to be. Can you give me one more reason why I should love, darling. Why should I care? Why should I cared for you. Why should I care? I should have cared. Oh, darling, why should I care? Why should I care for you? I should have been wise.
