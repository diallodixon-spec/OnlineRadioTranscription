finishing sixth form you know you know we're all deciding all right whether we're going to UWE or you know everybody applying to college mm-hmm and I applied to apply to UWE, UTEC and EDNA got into all of them and I decided decided to go to EDNA to do the visual arts course Wow but but that is an achievement UWE UTEC and edna one time they all said come what what school did you go to I went to Arden Arden all right Johnny wake up you know mighty god yes that's what's going on over there Optima Optima that because, you know, I like to tell people Arden for me is a good model of what an arts school can be because the students are encouraged to do the arts and to balance that with their academics.
