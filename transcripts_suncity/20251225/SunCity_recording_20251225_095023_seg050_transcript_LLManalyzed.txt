20251225 095023 hour 10 a.m. I really want to I need something special I need something new Just give me you Spare me the part Where you shower me with gifts Don't send me cards No box of chocolates And don't promise me world. I'm not that type of girl that needs that to feel complete. So don't bring me roses. Bring me the truth. Bring me diamonds.
