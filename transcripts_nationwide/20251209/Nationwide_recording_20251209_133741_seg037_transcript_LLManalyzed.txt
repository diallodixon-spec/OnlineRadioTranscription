My name is Turbulence and what's the far right way me choose it Occupation is singing and making music My ab is all reading and playing football But most of all like to hold And give you sweet love when the nature calls Master never bow your standing tall Let's procreate baby do not stall For your figure is enough man of all That's why I need your name and number and where you reside? I need you by my side Hey, hey, hey, Mr. Supervisor Think I'm gonna have to fall into your trap
