I can't make you proud. I put it down the right way. Yeah, these hips make a boy won't try me Slim waist, pretty face, stay behind me, behind me We'll change positions You take a hold on me I'm having visions Of you getting down with me And I know, and I know you've been watching me all night You keep moving right I'ma let you take control, oh-oh-oh Wind down for you, oh-oh Just don't leave me dancing on my own I'mma let you take control Oh-oh-oh-oh And I think you're ready
