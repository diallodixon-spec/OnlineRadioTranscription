50% of the island that is not destroyed by the hurricane must ramp up the agriculture. And I hear the Minister of Agriculture go to the Parliament and say they're going to do some, give them some seeds and give them support to ramp up the farming. The farmers there were ready. But you know, I'm hearing on the farm that complaints of, say, of all the talk, they have gotten nothing. These are the problems that happened in Jamaica. That we talk had very good talk, but when the actual things happened, nothing happened. But if these farmers had gotten that support, three weeks ago, they could have planted things already. I've got a little reed at the end of December, early January. But the longer it takes, if you look at some of our cabbage there, or pepper there, these things take long, six weeks to come in. And the government is serious about these things.
