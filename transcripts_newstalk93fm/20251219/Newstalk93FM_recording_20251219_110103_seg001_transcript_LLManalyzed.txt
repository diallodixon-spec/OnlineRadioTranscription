20251219 110103 Right back till the morning. Turn up the music, make me rock and come in. Right back til the morning. Yo, EJ, are you kidding me? I spy, I spy, that you see something you might like Won't you come over if you really feel it? Ask all your questions, it's the real me But come and see you with your crew, just a boom and I go true And I can tell, say you admire the realness Look at me looking at you, now you don't know what to do Just relax and I'll go in, how you feeling?
