20251223 150807 There's having to be a big one, Miriam Makeba, out of South Africa, track title Pata Pata. In the meantime, keep it locked to your station roots, the unstoppable radio station. It is Tuesday afternoon, musical vibes go straight to up until five. In the meantime, feel free to pick up that telephone, call me up, talk to me, what's happening in your community, what type of vibes happening on the streets right now, especially if you're in downtown, Apertree, or even Crossroads. I wanna hear from you, so pick up that telephone and dial 876-791-7283. We're inside the link, of course. We're gonna be dropping what we call a live link within 30 seconds. And I want you to be a part of that.
