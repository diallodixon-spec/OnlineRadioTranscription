20260101 210001 My fellow Jamaicans at home and abroad, as we welcome the new year 2026, I extend to you and your families my best wishes for peace, strength, and renewed hope. We enter this new year with deep gratitude, thankful for the gift of life,ful for the care that has surrounded us. And thankful for the compassion and solidarity shown to us over the past year by Almighty God, by Jamaicans at home and abroad, and by friends across the world. 2025 tested our maturity as a nation. We navigated a general election, embraced the democratic process with maturity, and observed as a new administration settled into its responsibility.
