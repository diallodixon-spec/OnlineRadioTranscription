20251222 123827 We don't want no batter that I need a little breather Two days on the road with some jam in the middle Diving home we need to find the middle For the sake of peace of mind So the middle of the road is clear You'll find me and my friend and them because We move so hard, so hard for a week We deserve a party, we deserve a party We deserve it Tell all your friends and them, tell all the girls so come on, say, make a joke. But let me start it by the joke, by the joke, let me start it, by the joke. Party on the road, there's a party on the road. Light it up, light it up, bring the shots and light it up. Party on me road, there is a party on me road. Look at life in the back, watch what kind of limit.
