20260101 151109 I need you, baby. Take a break. No time to linger. Got to be a lover. Got more to require. Love and happiness. Give me the answer. All the pricks that I had. No time to linger, it will surely last. I love you, you know, and I hope to let this feeling go. I'll give you my all, answer to your every call. We could build a carousel tree. Love to last for a lifetime. Have a little family. Please be mine. Oh.
