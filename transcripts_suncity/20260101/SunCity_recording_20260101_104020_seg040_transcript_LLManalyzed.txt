20260101 104020 Come in I see he's hurting you again When you're in pain I'm in pain That's for the being afraid But this is a special case I held my feelings back because of him And now I can see him more than I was. I made a big, big mistake. I don't mean to disregard your feelings, but I think that he's a fool. He don't know how sensitive you are. And baby, that just ain't cool cool I'm just glad I can be there for you when you need a open hand But deep inside my heart from the start I know I should be there for you
