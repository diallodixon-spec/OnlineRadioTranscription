months ago is still not ready. Mr. Ellis' attorney, Donahue Martin, who held for lead counsel, Tom Tavares-Finsall, argued that two separate psychiatric reports are required and expressed concern about the length of delay in getting even one. Mr. Ellis is accused of murdering the 77-year-old retired journalist who was found stabbed to death at her home in Caymanas Estates in Catherine on December 17 last year. Her Mercedes Benz was discovered the following day in Gregory Park and Mr Ellis was arrested just hours later in the nearby Grange Lane area. He reportedly gave police a cautioned statement about his alleged involvement. The trial of the five men accused in last year's multi-billion dollar cocaine bust in Havendale has been reset. Raquel Porter has the details. A new trial date of February 16 has been set for the five defendants linked to the 12 billion dollar cocaine operation uncovered in Havendale St. Andrew last August. The matter was originally scheduled for a hearing in November.
