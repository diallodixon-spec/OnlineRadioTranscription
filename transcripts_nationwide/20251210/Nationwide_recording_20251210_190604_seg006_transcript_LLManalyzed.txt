We're going to take a break and come back with more. Tracey? Hey girl, what's up? So hold on. Why you look so vexed this early? Didn't I just start? Lisa, it is so good to see you. But sorry you catch me like this, girl. My uncle said one by one when my family go for clarity, you don't want to hear the price the people then put on the something. But matters worse, me hear hear half of the things they are missing and I don't see any customs. Girl, how do you not see any customs? You should stop going like you don't have any sense. You don't see everybody that talks about it in the media. You don't want me to stop listening to you. Have you ever experienced that?
