============================================================

Evil is negative, totally negative and abhorrent. So we should think about evil as punishment. That's how we should think about it and look into it. And we can more understand why it even exists in our life as humanity. Why it's here, because it's something to be shunned and rejected and repulsed. So evil even punishment is very similar. If the Rastaman think about it like that, you should look at it from that point of view.
