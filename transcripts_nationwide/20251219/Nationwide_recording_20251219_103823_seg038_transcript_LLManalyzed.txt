20251219 103823 and you asked me if I'm aware that you raise chickens. Yes. Well, we're going to get to kill them and see how they kind of get out of the barn. You know? Are you hearing me? Yeah, man, I'm hearing you. So, you know, it's mostly six, seven, eight, nine pounds up that way. You know what I'm saying? And I care the people, they don't want them, they can't buy them. You understand? Yes. Some just have this type of people in a period who are polite people and people. You know, so I get one and say, let me take it and buy me the communication and things. So it's really hard for me, but we have rights, you understand? Right. That have that. So let's move on now. I want you to help me out. No man, don't move on yet man. So you have the chickens, they said they're weighing 69 pounds and I gather the pound is the per pound price that people are running from.
