20251212 211914 All I want for Christmas is a new brand, right? With a crime and the violence proceeds. Black teeth! Flow the little youth with them phone them. Have a worker to support them. Sit the little girl in her shorts and hold her tongue. Let the fire wind up and don't them. Rasp and borrow the linking of the street. Until you keep on everybody's seat. Take a shot, take a sip and a gunshot for me. Put down your gun then please. Make you have a crime free Christmas time. Don't let violence rock with vibes. No, no, no. Yeah. A crime-free Christmas time. Don't let bloodshed rock with vibes.
