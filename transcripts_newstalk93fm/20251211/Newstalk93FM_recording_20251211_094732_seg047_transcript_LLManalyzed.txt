that uncle, our aunt, our cousin, our friend will be coming to pick up on the name of the person. So it's a matter of just sensitizing the kids and make them aware of what to do, what not to do. I know the schools also have a role to play, the parents of a role to play. The PTAs have a roll to play. And I think that we just now need to look at these things. I think we need to double more on it. How did the man get the child out of the school compound? I don't know, but that is something which they need to review their security apparatus and protocols and ensure we don't have another recurrence in the future. But again, it requires community involvement to prevent these things from happening. It can't be that you see a man or a woman or a child just walking on the road. The child is behaving a particular way and you just tell yourself that it's a child maybe misbehaving and the mother scolds him or the father scolds him. Intervene, just say hi, good afternoon, how are you doing? What's wrong with the child? It's there and then it will pick up if there's something off.
