20260101 132819 We know we shall do finally in the name of Jesus. And so we stand on your word. We stand on the assurance of your word. And we Lord, tell you thanks today because Lord, we can put our trust in you. We can hope in you. And Lord God, you are able to sustain and keep. And so we tell you thanks. We humbly thank you Pastor Joseph Lee, Greater Apostolic Christ Temple Ministries. What a blessing. I'm looking at the WhatsApp line Pastor Lee, I'm seeing Amen, Amen and Amen. I hope that blessing reaches every single member of the Two Life Crew and extends way beyond that, right across the length and breadth of this nation. Thank you so much Pastor Lee.
