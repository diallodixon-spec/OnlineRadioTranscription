20251231 135329 Even when you're lost and it's hard and you're falling apart It's not over it's only begun so don't hide don't run cuz God's not done with you There's a light you don't notice until you're standing in the dark And there's a strength that's growing inside your shattered heart Even with your broken heart and your wounds and your scars Even when you're lost and it's hard and you're falling apart It's not over, it's only begun, so don't hide
