the 11th of December. Glad to have you with us. Coming up at 11.30 was a story yesterday in the newspaper which was quite endearing to Arlen Sundry who read the story about the S Hotel in Montego Bay spending some 21 million dollars to erect some 60 houses for people made homeless by Hurricane Melissa. We're going to be speaking to Andres Cope, who's the manager and brand ambassador for ESSATEL, to find out why they embarked on this endeavor and to get a little more detail about the whole exercise. But it seems on the face of it a fantastic effort on behalf of S Hotel. We'll find out more at 11.30. Before that, we'll start off with the bottom line.
