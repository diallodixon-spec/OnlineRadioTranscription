20251222 151007 We are mighty trapped out on the road All on his head All by the trap where we meet him every day Drop your location Tell me where you want me to find you With no hesitation Any man you're in love with you Drop your location Show me where you want to find you with no hesitation Meet me by his head We're ready for the road said i'm falling falling i'm falling as i lay my bed with my head to the ceiling Say I'm drowning alone and I'm lost in my feelings Somebody send me a sign cause you know that I need it
