Warner Bros. Discovery has intensified, with Paramount launching a hostile takeover offer that challenges Netflix's $72 billion deal. Paramount is going directly to Warner shareholders with a $74.4 billion proposal, offering more money overall and more cash upfront than Netflix. Unlike Netflix, which is not seeking Warner's cable channels, Paramount says it wants to buy the entire business, including networks such as CNN and Discovery. The move comes after Paramount says it submitted several proposals over the last three months, but Warner's leadership did not seriously engage. The company is now appealing straight to investors, arguing that its offer is more likely to survive anti-trust review under the Trump administration.
