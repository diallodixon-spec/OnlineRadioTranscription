So I can only imagine, you know, when The Harder They Come came out, what that was like, kind of equivalent of us reading Spratt Morrison for the first time and seeing ourselves in the pages of a book. Exactly. Let me jump in here as well. Yeah, man. It's not just seeing ourselves, it's also seeing our environment. So it's not just seeing what we look like. It's also seeing where we are. One of the things that's iconic about How Do They Come is also just the environment. It's seeing that we are moving through rural and urban Jamaica in the 1970s. And it's something we don't get to see, obviously, because of development. But that is also one of the things that makes this film also very iconic. I love that point because Colleen Douglas who was just talking to us about the film as well said that for her she remembers looking at it and saying oh that's what Kingston looked like.
