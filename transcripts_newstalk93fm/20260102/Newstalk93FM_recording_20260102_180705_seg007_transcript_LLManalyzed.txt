20260102 180705 I don't listen to nothing they say Every fat a drug, jumping up Doing what I want, jumping up Tell them I ain't leaving Right they are sleeping Every fat a drug Jumping my head gone And I'm miserable All down on the ground I'm causing trouble Look how the security watch me They don't know about me I just mash up, they don't want me because I do one way.
