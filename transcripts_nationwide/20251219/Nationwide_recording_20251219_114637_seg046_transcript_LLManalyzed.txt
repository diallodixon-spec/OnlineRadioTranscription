20251219 114637 issues with um wire transfers as well um so so there seems to be some something happening i see someone on our channel who goes by the handle carisha our carishaification saying everyone uh has rtgs problems it is something happening out in jamaica that we don't know about but we're not being told we're not but frankly about. I think the power dynamic that exists between the banks and the customers in Jamaica needs to be adjusted. The secrecy that entails banking in Jamaica is something that needs to be addressed as well. If you are having difficulties, you have to call before or you try something and then it's not working and then when you inquire is when you're being told that they have some problems that they're trying to resolve.
