20251225 195847 I've got to find me myself a woman What I wouldn't do now Ain't nothing for me Sitting there making fun of me Just because you've got your kids on your own and you've got money John, good for you Man, your life must be so happy Now on the other hand How we're trying to live the life just gets away Having a family would be so nice It would be a joy to me to find a lady Who would bring a baby boy for me or a girl for me Would mean the world to me like you You've got a woman to go into I've got to find myself a woman But I wouldn't be one like you
