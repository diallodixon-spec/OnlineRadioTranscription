20251231 192426 a bit of a problem I would think going into, I can't view with too much optimism what's going to be happening in 2026 because, okay, the calendar is out. It has been out for a few weeks now, 79 race meetings in 2026. And I'm not optimistic that we are going to do more races in 2026 than we did in 2025. We shall see. The problem here as far as the number of races per year is concerned is that since this claiming system came on board, the horse population was increased from seven, A class to G class, to 25. Now it's at 19. Now if the system that continues to divide the horse population into 19 categories the fields are going to have it less than 10 per race okay and I am saying that in my view that translates to 20% less in sales
