20251219 183825 event came off lovely. We got a lot of support from corporate and from our community members and really appreciate the support that we've been getting and we are continuing to make it bigger and better. I'll come next year and thinking that we want to bring some persons from the Caribbean to Jamaica to participate in that next event that we are planning on having in the coming year. Anne Marie, talk about female participation now. What's the level like? Female, we have maybe about three females in our program that are up to the level where they want to compete. They'd like to compete, but because of the lack of female involvement in the sport in Jamaica, it's posing a difficult task to find females.
