After tearing through England with seven wickets on day one, the left-hand player had his three more on Friday, reaching the milestone with the dismissal of England captain Ben Stokes in a fiery spell. The wicket, a late straight in short ball, edged to Steve Smith, marked the eleventh time Stark had removed Stokes in test. Stark marked speakers of 10% gay, making the first Australian pass boarder since Craig McDermott in tests.
