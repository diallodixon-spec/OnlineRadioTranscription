============================================================

Success is not the key to happiness. Happiness is the key to success. If you love what you are doing, you will be successful. Colleagues should take care of each other. Have fun. Celebrate success, learn by failure, look for reasons to praise, not to criticize, communicate freely, and respect each other. Success is not final. Failure is not fatal. It is the courage to continue that counts. The more you praise and celebrate your life, the more there is in life to celebrate. If you believe in what you are doing, you will be successful.
