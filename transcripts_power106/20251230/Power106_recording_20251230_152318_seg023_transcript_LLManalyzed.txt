20251230 152318 I'm a bandronica, I'm a son of the sun. I love the sea, I love the sea. I love the sun. Lord, I love this land. Don't matter where I go, Jamaica is my home. I love the girls who cannot bother on where I'm from. I hear some people say they are going away. But if I even leave, I won't be going away to stay. I'm a banjo beater. I'm a son of the soil. I love the sea.
