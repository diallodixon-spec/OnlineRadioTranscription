I was wondering if you enjoyed your birthday yesterday drinking some coffee, why you're so brilliant tonight Don't drink coffee but thank you very much Don't hate me though, don't hate me. Leonard? Leonard is it? Yes, that's Leonard. Okay. Yes, welcome back. Let's see, Mrs. G pay attention to the voices, you know, so. Right. Yeah, that's why you have to be careful. I just program them every time. And, um, doctor, thank you for that great explanation about this deep vein, the right way. Trombosis, yes. Right. You and Mrs. Gardner owe me one program, I think, two programs. What is the topic we're supposed to be doing? One of them was plastic surgery.
