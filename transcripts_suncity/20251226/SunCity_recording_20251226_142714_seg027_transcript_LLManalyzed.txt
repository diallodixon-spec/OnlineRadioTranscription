20251226 142714 from Massica. Zin. I'm not trying to go up, I'm on my giant trot And I'm good but they used to kill me, yes but man I'm high hope But stage I'm on and touch the stage and sing some I know it I go high for the family, them rock my boat Poverty is a celebration like July 4th They switch up on me thing but me no cry for guy in support Switch I'm a thing, but I'm not cryin' for guy support. Nothing more. Let's get me down to the floor, bring my dog down for a cup of thorn. I never mind, you know I jam my grub before. One side, get me blessings in my account and me live high. And when my wings them broken, me still fly. If you don't move the mountain, me still try.
