20251223 173526 Hi, thank you so much. Yeah, it's a Hurricane brings a lot of uncertainty and also a lot of solidarity and this response has been all about community from day one and people showed up for each other just as mr. Fernandez was saying Jamaicans feeding Jamaicans and a moment a hot meal can become a moment of calm and a way to say we're still here and we're going to get through this together. And everyone, including chefs, drivers, scouters, you name it, everyone, even tech people, we see tech crews, we see everybody that's helping this response is a network of over 700 people, most of them locals. So it's really Jamaicans feeding Jamaicans, and our response is focused on meeting that need quickly and consistently, making sure that families can count on at least one meal a day as they began to recover, and again, doing it with that vision in mind.
