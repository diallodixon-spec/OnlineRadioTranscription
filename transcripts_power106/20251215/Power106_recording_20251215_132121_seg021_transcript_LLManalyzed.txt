20251215 132121 I am very concerned about it because I've been to one particular gas station and every time I go there and the person would tell me an amount because you know sometimes the smaller change people just take their receipt and just go and I have been to that gas station on numerous occasions and I say I'm gonna pick up and I have picked up on it and I have to go back in the gas station and I said I'm supposed to get five dollars. Okay, it's their money. It's their money. make sure that they are giving their cashiers sufficient coins and change so that they can have, especially in the busy season. And they need, where possible, to do some retraining so that people don't do these type of activities of stealing people's money because that is theft.
