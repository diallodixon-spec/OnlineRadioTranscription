20251222 180204 This sweating spirit havin' me feelin' good. I have a linin' spirit. Early in the mornin' I at it. Me cooler ready. Me ice done ready. Me punchin' that's automatic. I have linin' jumbie. A kind of energy inside me. And it ready for the rum, ready, ready for the rum Ready, ready, for the rum Ready for the action, a spiritual encounter In me soul faking over Telling me to start up the drinking And do away with good behaviour So let we go, let we go down the road Let we go, it's action time, let we go It's bac on our time that we go Hands up This vetting spirit of me feeling good
