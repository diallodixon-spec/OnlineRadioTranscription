20251215 153933 I brought some corn for poppin' The lights are turned down low Let it snow, let it snow Let it snow When we finally kiss goodnight How I'll hate goin' out in the storm But if you'll really hold me tight All the way home I'll be warm The fire is slowly dy And, my dear, we're still good-byin' As long as you love me so Let it snow, let it snow, Let it snow He doesn't care if it's in below He's sittin' by the fire's cozy glow He don't care about the cold and the winds that blow He just says, let it snow Hello there, Merry Christmas I've been waiting for you
