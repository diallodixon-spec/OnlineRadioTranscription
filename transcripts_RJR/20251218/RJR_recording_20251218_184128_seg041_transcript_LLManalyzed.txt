20251218 184128 We are on the waterfront here in Black River and as you look at what has happened to all of those older structures along High Street heading right into the center of town What is I think something that has not been talked about enough is the impact of the storm surges and I will go beyond Black River for a moment and say perhaps the starkest reminders of what Melissa did was at Frenchman in Treasure Beach where there are two graves that are now about five feet above ground, meaning they were at ground level before Melissa. And the storm surge has taken away all the soil from around these graves which you know had the traditional concrete block vaults but embedded deep down in the ground all of that has gone and the same thing has happened with many of these buildings along the waterfront area in Blackpool
