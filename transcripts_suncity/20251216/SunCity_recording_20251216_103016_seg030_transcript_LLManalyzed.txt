20251216 103016 That's inside information, I never knew that. You can't go around the police when they come to you, they know if you have a permit or not before they reach to you, okay? So don't try to talk yourself out of it. All right, so guys, unfortunately, it's the end of the show, so we have to say our goodbyes. So thank you so much, Superintendent, for coming here today. I want to be at war with the producer, so I'm going to ask another question. Superintendent Ferran, outside of what we spoke about, let me segue a bit. We're in the festive season. A lot of women are out there driving, going to plazas, shopping. Any word of caution to our women this morning? Well, a special word of caution to the women, you know, just be vigilant. Ensure that you're always aware of your surroundings. Whenever you're driving, do not drive under the influence. As you know, it takes away your concentration from really seeing and observing everything that is happening in your environment.
