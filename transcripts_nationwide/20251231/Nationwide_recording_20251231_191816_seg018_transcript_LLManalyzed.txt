20251231 191816 biggest challenge. I must give kudos to, you know, people like DBJ, places like DBJ and so on who kind of give you the support you need and government, you know, in kind of ensuring that banks now seize receivables as potentially collateral where, you know, someone owes me money they can lend against it. But, you know, the biggest thing for me was kind of like the fundraising efforts. Being young entrepreneurs in Jamaica also is not easy. You have to prove yourself over and over again. But I think over the years, we've gotten better at it and we have had more opportunities for lending, equity and so on. And so for me, it has been a total experience and we're super happy about it. You know, what has helped us too is that, you know, COVID happened and made persons more aware about technology and how powerful it is right and so since then our business has benefited incredible from that. Yeah and Gordon what was your experience in getting Eddie Focal off the ground? Similar experience to Ricardo again you know balance sheet is last
