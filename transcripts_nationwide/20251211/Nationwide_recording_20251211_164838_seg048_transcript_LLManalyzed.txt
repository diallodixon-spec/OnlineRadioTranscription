2025-12-11 16:58:16 They have things that they don't want if it's too early. You know which part is going to help me? Not Jamaica. Because every employee of Jamaica right now put their mind on this woman here being their employee. I'm not asking you. You understand? She's been here since 7.30. Come here from 4. No, but look. The company probably won't even open yet. The place we're going to open is going to stop coming. You want the security work? Do you want the security work because why are you coming here so early in the day? Are you trying to steal the pens and papers in the building? Like where you come so early for? Like for example Digicel, it's always open, isn't it? Isn't it always open? Does it lock? It should be. It closes off downstairs? I don't think so. So when you guys leave here at 11, what time is it still open? Yeah. So what time it closes? After we're gone. Oh, okay. Kevin says about 3. So what time open then Kevin? About 4.30? Just a change of shift, right?
