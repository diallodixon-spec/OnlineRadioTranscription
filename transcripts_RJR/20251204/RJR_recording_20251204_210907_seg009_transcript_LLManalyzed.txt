============================================================

I can still hear inside my head Telling me, touch me, feel me And all the time you were telling me lies So tonight, I'm gonna find a way to make it Without you, tonight I'm gonna find the way to make it without you I'm gonna hold on to the times that we had, tonight I'm gonna find the way to make it, without you Have you ever tried sleeping with a broken heart? Well you could try sleeping in my bed Lonely, on me. Nobody ever shut it down like you. You are the crown. You made my body feel heavy bound. Why don't you hold me? Need me? I thought you told me you'd never leave me. Looking in the sky.
