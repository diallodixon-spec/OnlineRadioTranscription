and dress me up there's no excuse i crossed the line and paid the price won't let us die these just ain't thoughts we locked in face for life might as well keep my if i buzz it then i guess you pull it and since tomorrow ain't promised for you and i but I'ma keep a side I'll do whatever if you ask me Nobody on my body make a tag team I love the way that you address me when you address me, yeah Time can't erase a feeling that's strong Can't feel me, boy, I know you're way too You're full of life, it's dangerous Look in your eyes, it's dangerous Grateful I had all the patience
