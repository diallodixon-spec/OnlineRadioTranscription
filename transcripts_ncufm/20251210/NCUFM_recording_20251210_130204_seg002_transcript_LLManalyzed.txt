============================================================

We worship you, we worship you today. I live because you have allowed. I give because you showed me how. I'm here as a testimony unto you. There's no place I'd rather be. There's no other god for me there's no other name but give all the praise so we sing lift those hands Hallelujah. Come on and give him glory. Hallelujah. We worship you. Yes, we do. Hallelujah.
