In our personal growth, we may feel stuck in old patterns, but if we lift our eyes, we discover new possibilities, new skills, new relationships, new hope. In faith, we may feel confined by struggles, but God whispers, my universe is bigger than your pain. Hubble's discovery is scientific, yes, but it's also spiritual. It tells us that creation is vast and our lives are part of something greater. We're not small specks lost in the dark, we are chosen.
