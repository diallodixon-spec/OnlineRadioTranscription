20260102 155132 live crew. Britain Wright, over to you. Not a dollar for your shame. Turn up trunk and go and wall it. What the bunyo do? No show it. All when the pipe out fi bust like a festering store full of puss and you a fight and fuss with a torrent of pain just suppress it. Press it down like a mampi on a three legged donkey. No make them catch you a sing no sad song key. You come too far fi put down the pretence and watch the spoil. Put on a pretty proper plastic smile. Low the cow ball in fi girl child.
