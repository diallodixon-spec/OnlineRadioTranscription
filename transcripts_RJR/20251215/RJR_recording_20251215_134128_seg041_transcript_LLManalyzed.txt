20251215 134128 I was on my way to Portland recently on Friday. And I'm happy that I can report that I'm back safely without an incident or accident. Thank God, because I think it's only the grace of God took you to okay. The bushing that takes place on the main road, the main roads leading to Portland via St. Mary and so on, You know, those very windy, small, narrow, thoroughfares. When you are bushing, right? Can't you buy any kind of sign, some indicator? Can you buy work in progress? Even if you a cone you said you put an orange cone to warn you to warn me that something is happening on the side of the road or in this area bearing in mind johnny has not been to portland for a little bit for a little bit so you're not you're unfamiliar with just like many tourists
