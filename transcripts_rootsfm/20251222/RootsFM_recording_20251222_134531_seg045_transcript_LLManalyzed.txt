20251222 134531 I've been waiting for that day to call you mine. I was thinking we could fall in love. Do what you want as long as you're with me. Say what you want, as long as I hear you calling my name, over and over again. Oh, say what you want. As long as you take me, love me for real. I promise you hear me calling your name over and over again. I'm just searching, searching for the truth. All I know is my heart belongs to you. I'm not in this just for the honeymoon but all the way Do what you want as long as you're with me, say what you want, as long as I'm here
