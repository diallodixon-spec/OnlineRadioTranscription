20251215 161207 My bed with my head to the ceiling See I'm drowning alone and I'm lost in my feelings Somebody send me a sign cuz you know that I need Connie welcome back to me cause you know you're my healing. I said it's okay, it's my therapy. Therapy, my therapy. Can't take away all of my anxiety. Anxiety, my remedy. I tell you that we all need love.
