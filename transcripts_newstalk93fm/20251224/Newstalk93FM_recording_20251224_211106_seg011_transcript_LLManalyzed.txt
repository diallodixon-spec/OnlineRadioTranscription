20251224 211106 I thought my house was haunted I used to live with ghosts And all the perfect couples Said when you know, you know And when you don't, you don't And all of the foes and all of the friends Seen it before, they'll see it again Life is a song, it ends when it ends I was wrong But my mama told me it's alright You were dancing through the lightning strikes Sleepless in the onyx night But now the sky is open light oh oh oh oh oh my lord never made no one like you before you had to make your own sunshine but now this sky is open light
