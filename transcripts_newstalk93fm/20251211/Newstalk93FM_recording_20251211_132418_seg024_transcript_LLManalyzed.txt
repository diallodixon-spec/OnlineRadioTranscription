============================================================

I want to be in your life until the night is over Until the night is over until the night is old And I believe in fast life, but I see it in mo And you see my lifestyle, I got G's in the tubo See many people there outside where they feed man's hobo Oh no, I'm here standing defender like Joseph Yobo Bad girl say she wanna flex and chill So I just take it, even warning If you fall in love, girl is hurting You go to a breakfast, I'm not capping. Can you see dripple? I'm not catching. I'm not faking this, not fugazi. You see these feelings, I'm not catching, I'm not question fit, I just want it. Happiness, if I broke down my business.
