And next week, back to Chattabee Center, it's a bit. And I got it there. And from there, it's like every week, every week, ever week, we just push it, push it and push it and, you know, choose some songs that people would really take on and love it. And we give thanks, and this is the writing style that came in my life, the other way. We bring out Nadi to Jamaican people, even though we did die on the sound system, and I don't know how they produced before, but we have to give thanks for that. Yes, yes rebel in me naughty oh my gosh i mean i don't think anybody could have heard that song for a while and not think about naughty virtue why did that song connect so deeply with you at the time
