go into the bank where that's concerned. You have these institutions, they have now that you can get like same day loans, but those tend to be, the rates of payback tend to be very predatory, all right? So I don't recommend those. I recommend the old school institution where you can go in, find out what they have available, et cetera, and what those requirements are. But as I said, you prioritize based upon what is the urgency where the situation is concerned. For, say for example, to furnish your place, I personally, where furnishing of your place is concerned. Higher purchase terms tend to be high. So I always say to persons as much as is possible that you can do cash purchases or as much as possible do so.
