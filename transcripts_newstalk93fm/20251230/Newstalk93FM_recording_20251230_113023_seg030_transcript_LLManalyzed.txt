20251230 113023 With you, I want to dance the night away One jam, turn a lifetime, baby So go feel the way You don't like the fast life Look on the bright side, girl I go take the blame I just want you come and light it up Just a winding up. Come and meet me behind the truck and we rev it up. All day, keep throwing it back at the way you stop. Baby, no way. We could post up all the pictures you want when you're ready. I go over here, darling. You go over there. But we compete in the middle and start a bacchanal. Play in the middle, hey. What we gonna do now? Jam to a rhythm in the heat. I can't evil, but in the heat, hey. What we go do now? Start a whine on it. I say compromise on it. Baby, spend time on it. Hey, I say.
