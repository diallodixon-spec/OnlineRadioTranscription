20251223 103719 I want to say to both of them, Merry Christmas when it comes. And I salute you all for both of you for the dedication and the good work you all are doing to bring the truth to light. Because the truth set us free. And Melissa come to show all of us Jamaican and African, the truth about this government. And only our eye will see the reward of the wicked. Because the truth will set us free. And I don't want the people of Jamaica to think that the three quarter we are here now. We have a dictatorship going on in Jamaica right now. And until we can open our eyes and see that, because we are not as full as they think we are. I am a farmer over a period of 40 years, a proud farmer. Spending some time in the Jamaica defense force.
