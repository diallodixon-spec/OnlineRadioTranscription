20251218 195642 God knows what I'm going through. And he loves you too. Help me Lord. And I'm letting go. At the end. At the end of the tunnel. There's nowhere. There's nowhere to go. Thank you, Lord. Thank you for your goodness. Because without your love, Lord. Without your love. I don't know where I'd be. God knows where. I'd be. I'd be today. Tell me to trust you. You felt it through trust. So do what you want me to do, God. Here is my poor, right God. Take and use me. And take me, Lord.
