20251230 173726 million to rebuild I think that any organization that has made the significant contribution that the church has made to the society it should be considered for relief and I have no problem at all with it you know so that's that's my position because the church plays an integral part in the life of the people of Jamaica more than just clapping and on a Sunday morning or on a Saturday we're an an integral part in the world's social, emotional, psychological life of this country, moral and ethical. And I have no problem with it as in, where the church has helped, because it's a drop in the bucket in comparison to the magnitude of damages that we have suffered. That is a drop in a bucket, but it will certainly help to help some of our poorer churches, as a matter of fact, to rebuild their places where people look forward to go to their places of solace, to their places of worship, and to their places of receiving whatever kinds of help they can get from an agency that continues to provide it. Dr. Baker, it sounds as if you kind of had mixed feelings listening to Mr. Warmington.
