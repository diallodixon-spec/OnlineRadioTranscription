Authorities say the restrictions will remain in effect for the full 48-hour period. Two teenage girls are recovering in hospital after being struck by bullets during illegal gun salutes shortly after midnight earlier today. This is despite repeated warnings from the Jamaica Constabulary Force. In one incident, a 13-year-old Canadian visitor was standing on a balcony along Dreamland Drive in Portmore, St. Catherine, watching New Year's fireworks when she was hit in the thigh and back. Loud explosions were heard moments after midnight. She was taken to hospital and is listed in stable condition. In a separate case, a 14-year-old girl from Bond Street in Kingston was injured around the same time while sitting under a tree in her community. She felt a burning sensation in her shoulder and was later found to have been shot.
