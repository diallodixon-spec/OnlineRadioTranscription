20251212 215439 Gone to heaven What a way to go I can't catch my breath It must be a dream That you're the cutest thing I've ever seen I'm way past the point of recovery. You're going to be the devil in me. You only knew what you're putting me through. It feels like a heart attack. You're giving me a heart attack. A heart attack! You're giving me heart attack. Must've died and gone.
