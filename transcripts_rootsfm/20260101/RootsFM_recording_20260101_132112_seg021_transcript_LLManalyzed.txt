20260101 132112 I would go there For love to the end of nowhere It's for her and for her love I would go, I would go I would go, and I would go To justend all my time with a girl who makes me feel the love is mine Someone you see who would only dream of me She She'd be in love, that's what she'd wanna be. She'd wanna be loved. There's nothing better than love, but in the world.
