============================================================

You puttin' up a wall, but you I done got it out the mud, ain't got nothin' to prove Tryna open up your mind and see a clearer view All the times I made you wait for me, no But I was on the other side and didn't notice I won't waste no time I won't waste my time when it comes to you Put my love, baby? Why can't you come on and let us play? When are you going to come my way?
