20251230 214027 I can put my heart up, loving you around. Loving you around, huh? I'm plugged in your lawn now, show you on my car now. Look, I don't need a rich bitch to somebody that can make me feel safe. Yeah, look, I don't want a couple, but nobody ever made me feel safe like you. Facts, cause when I'm with you, I just know I know you know that I'm that right. You got a girl that want to get right. When I pass and I crash, you ain't gonna get right. That's when I need you the most. That's how I get right, baby.
