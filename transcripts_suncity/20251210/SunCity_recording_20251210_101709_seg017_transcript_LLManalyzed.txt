============================================================

We have each other like the moon and star You are my Christmas, yes you are I don't need a present on a glowing tree When I've got you right here with me Always beside me, never too far You are my Christmas Yes you are No frosty windows, no sleighs on the street But your presence made the silence oh so sweet The snow might fall or it might stay away But you were my all year round Christmas But someone else is there for me, don't you think?
