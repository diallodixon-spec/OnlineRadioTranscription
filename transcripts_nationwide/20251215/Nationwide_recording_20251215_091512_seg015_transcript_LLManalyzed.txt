Now, for persons who are not familiar with the express entry system, it is an online system wherein persons who are interested in migrating to Canada, you submit your profile, so you're entering all of your information, name, personal information, your education details, your work experience. And for persons who want to enter the express entry system, please remember that you need to enter all of your work information because you never know. Some of that work experience may help to give you additional points. So last week there was a draw for the Canadian experience class category. The Canadian experience class category is for persons who have at least one year work experience in Canada in certain job titles.
