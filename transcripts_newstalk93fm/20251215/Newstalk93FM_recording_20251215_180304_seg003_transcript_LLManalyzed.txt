20251215 180304 With you I want to dance the night away One jam's in a lifetime baby So don't feel away You don't like the fast life I look on the bright side I go take the blame I just want you come and light it up Just a a little winding up. Come and meet me in the end. Can we wrap it up? All day. start a wine on it I say, compromise on it Spend time on it, I say compromise on it
