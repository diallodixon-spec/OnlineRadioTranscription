Dumbeholing have jumped to ninth in the standings after a 1-0 victory over Tivoli Gardens in the Jamaica Premier League at the Dumbeholing Sports Complex on Sunday. Nicholas Nelson scored the winner in the 50th minute. We defeated ourselves and you can see the high growth of indiscipline. You know, the game of football, it's a collective effort that will result in you being winning a game. Today, it's more about individual. As a result of that, it cost us again.
