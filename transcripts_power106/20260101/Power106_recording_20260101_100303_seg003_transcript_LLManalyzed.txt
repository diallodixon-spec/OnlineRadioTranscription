20260101 100303 So let yourself reach for that star And go no matter how far To the one you love, to love And I mean all these words I say You don't have to guess what's going on inside my head Just try to know all the things that our hearts say Listen to love and always get love to lead the way Whenever you love There's nothing better than love What in the world could you ever be thinking of? It's never my fault
