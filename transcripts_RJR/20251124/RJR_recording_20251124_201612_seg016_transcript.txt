============================================================

You say give me strength to try to carry your weight And do the holy work Give me strength that I can make my stand Above the sinking sail When you're trying to leave You are not alive But I wouldn't be so unwise And so I promised to serve thee With all my heart And I'm begging thee mercy Lord, give me strength to face another day Make it a long life's road and carry on my love
