Jamaican people, they will bounce back and they're going to bounce back bigger and stronger. It's not going to be no joke. And I feel like anybody that keeps a function this year, people is going to get a good reception and turnout because people want to get out. And, you know, just even if it's for a few hours, just, you know, forget things and just celebrate life and celebrate, you know, the country, the culture and the people. So I think that events happen over Christmas. I feel like they're gonna have a good turnout this year I don't know about for the people and that side of the island if they're able to keep things But I guess if they can travel they will come down to you'll go to places where they can go to events But yes, the corporate companies need to do what they can do because they're mean why oh boy and yes happy king day to you no well okay Joe Joe is saying in Canada being employed for 36 years at the same place
