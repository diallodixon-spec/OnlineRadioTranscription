20251231 124927 my life when you come to my rescue a thousand times every other voice it is a lie God provides God provides in ways I can't explain and can't deny The little that I have He multiplies Just when I feel He won't show up on time God provides He'll come through When the clouds of doubt rain down on you and test everything you thought you knew. Now you finally see what God can do for you.
