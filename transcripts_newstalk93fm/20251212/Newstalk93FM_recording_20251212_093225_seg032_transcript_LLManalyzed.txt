20251212 093225 I heard you call me boring Barbie when you're out feeling brave High-fives my ex and then you said you're glad he ghosted me Wrote me a song saying it makes you sick to see my face Some people might be offended But it's actually sweet All the time you've spent on me It's honestly wild All the effort you've put in It's actually romantic i really gotta hand it to you no man has ever loved me like you do i hadn't thought of you in a long time
