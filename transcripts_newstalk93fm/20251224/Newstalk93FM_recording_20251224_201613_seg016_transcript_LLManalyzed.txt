20251224 201613 I could ever know Make my wish come true All I want for Christmas is you I don't want a lot for Christmas There is just one thing I need Don't care about the presents I only need the Christmas tree I don't need to end my stocking Live never call the fireplace. Santa Claus won't make me happy, with a toy I can use to stay. I just want you for my own, more than you could ever know.
