20251215 185734 Anastasia Potopova says she has switched nationality from Russian to Austrian after her application for citizenship was accepted. Russia has been banned from competing in team competitions since the invasion of Ukraine, prohibiting Potopova from playing in the Belizean King Cup. The 24-year-old who represented Russia in that tournament in 2018 and 2019 will be eligible to play for Austria next year. Once the switch takes effect, Potapova, ranked world No. 51, will become the new Austrian No. 1, replacing Julia Grabo, who sits 94th in the rankings. Potapova, who has not played since the China Open in October because of injury, is the latest in a growing line of Russians to switch allegiance and represent a different country. World No. 1 Irina Sabalenka has been voted the Women's Tennis Association Play of the Year for second successive season. The 27-year-old won four titles, the most on tour, including retaining the U.S. Open
