20251216 184832 When our eyes met, our souls connected, we knew right away. Every moment, every single road led you to me. I love you so, never gonna let you go. I want the world to know and answer to my prayers I am loving you so now Louder than the loudest thunder Higher than the highest wonder And answer to my prayers I love again, because in love then lost Nobody no believe, in a god again It seems all faith is gone Nobody no believe, and it hurts my heart Turn the lights on, the world so dark Cause I believe, that love is everlasting
