20251212 192415 phones, you're not allowed to bring your phone in. If you receive, it's going to be confiscated, so either they leave it in reception or they put it away. But is it safe to say that most of them either have a phone or are online? Most of them have a phone and I would say these days young people, they live online. Yeah, that's true. I'm interested to see exactly how the workshop will go, so maybe you can take us there. Yeah, sure. Okay. So I've come into one of the classrooms. It's your typical classroom. It's got pictures. Looks like it might be a geography room. There's a screen at the front and you can see the teacher's desk. I have to say it's really nice being here, not as a student, but so right now we're waiting for the boys who will come down in a bit and then we'll start the session. The team from Shout Out UK are setting up a presentation on a projector. I get chatting to Sam Kashti who's running today's session.
