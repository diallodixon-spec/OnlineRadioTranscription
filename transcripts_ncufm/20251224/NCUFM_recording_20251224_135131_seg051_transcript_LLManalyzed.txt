20251224 135131 Ooh, NTU Ooh, ooh I choose you Standing in your ruins Feels a lot like the end So used to losing you're afraid to try again right now all you see are ashes where there was a flame truth is that you're not forgotten cause grace knows your name God's not done with you even with your broken heart and your wounds in your scars Even when you're lost and it's hard and you're falling apart
