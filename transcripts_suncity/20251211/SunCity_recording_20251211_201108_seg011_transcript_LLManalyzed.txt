2025-12-12 13:53:02 This is where I want to be So I'm coming home, coming home Cause home is where I belong Somehow I lost my way Mistakes I made, I have to pay It hurts to know still today That I wasted so much time And after all is said and done There's more to life than having fun There ain't no doubt you're the one And all I need is you
