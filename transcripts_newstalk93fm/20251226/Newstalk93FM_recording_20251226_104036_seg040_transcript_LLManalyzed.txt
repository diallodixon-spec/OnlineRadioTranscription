20251226 104036 So don't you ever let me down again Cause I'm depending on you So you better come through this time Please hear my cry and if I ever let you down my friend It was a misunderstanding. So I thought you'd get forgotten. You're not promised from today. I go drunk like I never drunk. Waved like I never waved. Wired like I never won before. Just to show you I'm sorry. I'm sorry. And I need you back in my life. Look at people by the truck. Emotions running high. We are not in the sky. Just running down with high. Can't you tell that we sorry? We sorry. And we need you back in with high. I need you back on the road. The road.
