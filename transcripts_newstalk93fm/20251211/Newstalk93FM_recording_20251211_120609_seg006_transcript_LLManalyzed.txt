When I'm feeling under the weather You just make me feel sweet Ice the cocoa tea, use the sugar And together we are complete, darling Heat me up Only you alone can put fire back in my soul Heat me up And they tellin' me I should leave that fire alone Well, the more they tell me, it's the more I hold in your clothes I could never let you go. Miss Hoshine. Girl, I'm coming home and I'll see you again. All day through the night, I'm dreaming. Yeah. Miss hoshine. When you turn the top, make it smooth, my darling. When outside is clear.
