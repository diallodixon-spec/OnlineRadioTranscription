20251230 091109 What moment? Well, I don't know. I have to find out if she has done that yet. any discretion that can be utilized maybe put her on a payment plan or something like that okay so i would say that's the next step because the amnesty was on for quite a while to be free to the nwc and extended i think twice so um it's it's done now um the one that's currently on is for businesses so wouldn't benefit from that, commercial customers. But I would say still try to go into an NWC office, speak with someone, explain the situation, and see what they can do for you.
