20251224 180604 We wish you a Merry Christmas Christmas. We wish you a happy eerie Christmas. And a happy, happy, happy block pocket day. Since God broke pocket day, I never tell you about the day. Because I know about the Christmas. Come on, I'll tell you, I I know bout the Christmas, yeah, yeah, yeah. Magic Christmas come and I don't need no one said to buy a toy. Wadada, wadada means love. Love in Africa, love in Jamaica. But I don't need to really tell you when you need me.
