20251216 161110 who would you say are the right quote unquote right people that are fighting when you have issues with your with your partner the first thing what i would do it was like take a inner look and see if do some self-introspection yeah first because you know i really jump to conclusion yeah yes nice then now we can move forward to approaching the person in hand that you have the issue with. I don't think you should go to a mother, a father, a friend or even a therapist. You have to fix it. So you're not talking to nobody but no issue with a video partner ever? I mean I can't recall because I try not to because I've been in a situation where yo I tell somebody say yo you know what's the way and next week i'm me and our pp club club and they might say watch out yes stand up for yourself
