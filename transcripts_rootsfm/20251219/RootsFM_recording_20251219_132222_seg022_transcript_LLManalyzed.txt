20251219 132222 Take it away! The ocean of wickedness The ocean of fearful weakness The ocean of drama, the ocean of tears Rastafari judgment is much lighter The love of righteousness Preys Rastafari's most kindness Love and salvation is so impious Since I cannot do it my love is kindness Everything is alright As as long as there's time, till you love a new night. Nothing is wrong with this music, all the vibes young. Everything is alright, we play for you now.
