20251225 125739 Our holiday voyage has come to a joyful close. We laughed, shared stories, and sailed through the season together. A big salute to my second mate, Abigail Bethune, and the new Sports and Current Affairs crew who keeps this ship steady. As your holiday cruise captain, Xavier Dixon, I want to remind you the holidays are about carrying joy. From the kitchen to the living room. From laughter to love. And from one heart to another. So as we drop anchor today, take that holiday spirit with you. May your seas be calm. May your sails be bright. And may all your celebrations be full of cheer. This is coming to you from everyone here on this steamship cruising. Happy holidays, safe travels, and smooth sailing until we set sail again.
