============================================================

If you ain't gonna treat you the way you should, then let it go. Baby, let it go. If you aint gonna love you, the way you should. Then let it go if you didn't know I got a whole new thing going on Break bread if you won want to. Because leaving you is what I won't do. I'm in love with you completely. And ain't nobody else out there for me. A couple shots of Patron, but I ain't drinking all alone. I've got the hubby with me. I've been a feeler.
