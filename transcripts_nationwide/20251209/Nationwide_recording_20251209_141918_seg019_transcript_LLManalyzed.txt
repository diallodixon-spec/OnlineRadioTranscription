Still got love in my soul Still Feels like the first time we met Then I kissed and I told you I loved you We still run around like teenagers Even though we're grown and married with kids And we still Talk on the phone for hours when I'm away He still writes letters and sends me flowers every other day The question everybody asks is how we make it last I tell them I still, he still, we still How's your day going? You know that you can always save what's on your mind Are you on your way home? I'll warm up your plate when you arrive
