fall on a student, and that is when we're going to have the authorities running in and trying to solve the problem. And the principal of York Castle High School, Raymond DeTresure, says over 3,000 students are making a dangerous trek daily. I know in my mind that poles should have been removed. I mean, York Castle High has 1,350 students. Brownstone High, as far as I know, about 1,400. Then there's a primary school next door with over 1,000 and more. With the traffic piling up, students trying to negotiate traffic and polls in order to get where they're going. The rural school buses, about six of them, large buses, under those wires every day along with over 50 private buses. I'm saying we need to do something about that now before we have an accident. I'm calling on the utility companies from what I can see. It's both power and telecommunications.
