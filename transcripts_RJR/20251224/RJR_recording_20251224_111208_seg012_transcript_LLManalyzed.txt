I can't hear it. So what's your favorite Christmas memory and that you, you know, your favorite Christmas, Merry Christmas tradition and what is it that you'd want to see for the Christmas to come? The thing is that my favorite Merry Christmas was back home. Where that day? When my mother used to order a whole heap of pork and corn it up and put it in a barrel. Yeah man. Till it touch? Yeah. Ah, you know what I'm talking about. Firebond. Even when I used to eat meat, I never liked touch pork.
