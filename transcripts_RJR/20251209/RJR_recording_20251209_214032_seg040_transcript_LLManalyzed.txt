If me live with a married woman for a period of time, that woman dead, and nobody come there for me in a period of time when she died, people come claim things. If me live with her, she died 12 years with me in my circle, 12 years, nobody can come to come take out nothing. Straight up. After 12 years, and me live with her. She died 12 years, and rich people come claim tools and things. Tell me what's going on. When it's going to rain, tell me what is going on there. After 12 years, nobody is supposed to come to claim anything. That's a good question, Donovan. You can hang up and listen to the answer. All right. Gail, you want to deal with that? Gail believes, Donovan believes, that there is a 12-year limitation period that does not apply. People can't come forward. The real sports can't come forward after 12 years. How do you respond? Well, he may have a point. That is if it is in relation to land.
