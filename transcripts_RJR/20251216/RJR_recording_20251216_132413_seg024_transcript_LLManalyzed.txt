20251216 132413 So I can start for you, you know? Slow down. Yeah, I'll measure out myself. Yeah man, you're right, you know? Yeah, sure. A lot of these things. As I said, something gets me by surprise today. All right. You see me? Close this roundabout, you know, they might, you know, do the little debouching and them things. And cleaning and paint. partial isn't it? No and I'm just asking like if you see dirt. I'm just going to tell you it's not partial. Like if you see dirt, I'm going to tell you something. I realise when you have a weed worker, who I drive, I look out for them, they don't look out for you. They don't care. Yeah because I'm telling you, you better wind up your window. I wouldn't wind up your window, I might be the victim.
