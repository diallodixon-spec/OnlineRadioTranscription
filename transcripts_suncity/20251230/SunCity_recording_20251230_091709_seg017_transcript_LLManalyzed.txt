So one response right here from doing in Canada, he's saying he's right, churches don't pay taxes, so why should taxpayer money be used to rebuild them taxpayers go to church though every single Saturday morning and the Sunday morning so when I go to church I pay my money in Jamaica I pay taxes people pay taxes so what you're saying what is just the building it's just the building but pay taxes. Yeah, but it doesn't matter. But me and other church pay taxes. And make we remove that part of it. What do you mean there should not be money given to rebuild?
