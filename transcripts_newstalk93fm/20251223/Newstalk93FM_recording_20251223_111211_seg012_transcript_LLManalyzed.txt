20251223 111211 We're going up, up, up. It's our moment. You know together we're glowing. Gonna be, gonna be golden. Up, up, up with our voices. Don't let them get you so confident. Gonna be gonna be golden. I'm done hiding. Now I'm shining like a butterfly. Waited so long to break these walls down To wake up and feel like me Put these patterns all in the past now And finally live like the girl they all see No more hiding, I'll be strong
