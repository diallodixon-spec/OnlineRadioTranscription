So what we have agreed is that in recognition of the excellence that we have in team sports, that we will now do a national team of the year award. And since we are having a national team of year joint, a national sportsman of the year and a national sportswoman of the year, we can't then just call it national sportsman and sportswomen of the year and leave out the team. So to be inclusive, we have changed the name to be the RJR Cleanerlena National Sports Awards and that covers everybody. Chairman of the RGR-Glena Sports Foundation, Gary Allen.
