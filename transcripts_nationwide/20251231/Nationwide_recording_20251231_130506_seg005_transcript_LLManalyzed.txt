20251231 130506 This all or nothing way of loving Go be sleeping without you I need somebody to know Somebody to hear Somebody to have Just to know how it feels It's easy to say But it's never the same I guess I kinda like the way you help me escape Now the day bleeds into nightfall And you're not here to get me through it all I let my guard down and then you pull the rug I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved And I tend to close my eyes when it hurts sometimes I fall Nationwide Night D.F.L.
