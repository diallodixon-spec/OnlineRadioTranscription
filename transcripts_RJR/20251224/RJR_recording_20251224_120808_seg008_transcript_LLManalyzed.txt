Dr. Holness says the addition of the 10 new trucks will allow the NSWMA to redeploy vehicles that had been diverted from their core function of collecting municipal waste, enabling them to resume that service. The new trucks will be dedicated to collecting organic debris, that's inorganic debris, including zinc, construction materials, wires, and fallen light poles. In the meantime, Minister of Local Government and Community Development Desmond McKenzie says steady progress is being made in clearing the debris left behind by the hurricane. Minister Mackenzie shared that in the next year's budget the government will allocate funds for additional contractor that's compactor trots as well as smaller units designed to serve hard to reach communities and rural areas.
