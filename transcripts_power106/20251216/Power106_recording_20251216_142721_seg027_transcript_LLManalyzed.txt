20251216 142721 It was all today, Davin. I didn't bring my section of the Gleaner down. I only have the A section that was in the studio. What I see here, the Christmas cookbook, a plate for all. Look inside. And this was today's paper. So yes, the Gleaner's Christmas cookbook, always a hit out there, is out in today's edition of the Gleaners. Also on the front page of the Gleaner, Smith lauded for integrity, innovation and staff-centred leadership. The tributes continue to pour in for the late Anthony Smith, Chief Executive Officer of the RGR Gleaner Communications Group. Governor General Sir Patrick Allen, Smith's death is a great loss to Jamaica's media and corporate landscape. The Minister of Culture, Gender, Entertainment and Sport paid tribute to Anthony Smith as well.
