**Interview with Superintendent Courtney Coley**

In another interview on Nationwide 90 FM, Superintendent Courtney Coley, head of the Community Safety and Security Branch, discussed the branch's mandate to institutionalize community policing throughout the constabulary and society. He explained that the branch works to bridge the gap between the police and the communities they serve, citing programs such as the police youth club, safe schools program, and neighborhood watch.

Superintendent Coley emphasized the importance of local knowledge in policing and the need for community meetings, partnerships with churches and schools, and prevention efforts to address generational conflicts and violence. He encouraged community members to come forward and work with the police to prevent and mitigate challenges, stating that "together we are stronger" and that a strong partnership between the police and the community is essential to breaking the back of crime.

When asked about morale within the force, Superintendent Coley noted that the Jamaican Constabulary Force is in transformation mode, with a focus on people, technology, and quality policing.
