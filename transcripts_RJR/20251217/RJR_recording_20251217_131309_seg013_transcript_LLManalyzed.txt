20251217 131309 I seem to find that no matter how the years unwind Still I reminisce about the girl I miss And the love I left behind My eyes adore you Though I never laid a hand on you My my sweetheart. Like a million miles away from me, you couldn't see how I adored you. So close, so close, and yet so far. My sweetheart. Oh, that life I will remember. love and gender, I'll enjoy that then, oh, oh, baby. But the feelings I regret, I know I won't ever forget.
