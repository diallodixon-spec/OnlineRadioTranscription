20251226 152020 I don't wanna play that part I know that I love you But let me just say I don't wanna love you In no kind of way, no, no I don't want a broken heart I don't want to play the broken hearted girl No, no, no broken hearted girl No broken hearted girl I gotta take a little time A little time to think things over I better read between the lines In case I need it when I'm colder In my life, there's been a heartache
