20251223 091010 You tell me you're gone, you know, I'm upset, selfish, I carry something everywhere like my helmet. Great skies, how much I love when the rain fall, I'm holding on, holding on. No remorse when them stole your soul, me say me feel it hard. Where you gone left me? Miffy day a road, you tell me you gone, you know I'm upset. Selfish, me carry something everywhere, like my helmet. Wish me coulda bring your body there when you see. Body pulled, caught, eyes full of beer, my gauge. Slick a chip in and my brain a lucky it not damage. All in all. Firm and blunted. Pressing us to flow like some time. This morning, one bagger chanting. Morning. Me a brick, woman full of repose. Many things me can do it out. Anything me want, jaja make it start out. Happy work, sun a shine till it blister.
