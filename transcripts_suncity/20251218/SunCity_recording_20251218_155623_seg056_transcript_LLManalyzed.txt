20251218 155623 Don't love me, don't love me Don't wanna touch me, don't touch me I don't want you to do anything That you don't want to do And if you don't I don't wanna miss me, don't miss me Don't wanna kiss me, don't kiss me I don't wanna you to do anything You don't wanna do Oh in my bed, so I'll never put a foot on your plate. I refuse to believe that you'd better ever love me. I've got to move on. Our love is gone. And this house is not a home.
