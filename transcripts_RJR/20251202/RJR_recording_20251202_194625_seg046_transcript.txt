We want our children healthy. And so our first formers, as well as our fourth and fifth formers, we ensure that their health is up to par. So our students doing exams, external exams, they will enter with a clean bill of health. It's also a form of trying to get the parents out in the school so that they can be a part of what is happening. Because if you notice, teaching and learning still continues. The classroom is not interrupted.
