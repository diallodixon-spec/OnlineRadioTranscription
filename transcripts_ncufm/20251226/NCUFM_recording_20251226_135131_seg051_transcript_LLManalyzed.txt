20251226 135131 Tryna watch the words in my mouth and stay on the rise Trouble come and go Even on the mountain high or the valley low Never let your faith go Oh! Never let you faith go I've been there before So confused don't know which way to go Stressed out, world so crazy Minds will stay in the house Fear trying to rise up Got terrors disguised like us, but we know who we trust. Trust when I say that we gon' be all right We gon' be alright You say we gon' be alright That's all right
