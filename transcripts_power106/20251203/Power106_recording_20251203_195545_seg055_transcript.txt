South Africa pulled off one of the greatest ODI chases on Indian soil, reading in 359 to win by four wickets in Nehrui Porn, matching the joint-highest successful run chase ever achieved in India. Edmarkham set the tone with a superb 110 at the top, while Maxio Bresceschi and Deval Brefis had decomposed half centuries to stay at the proteas home with four deliveries to spare. This came after Brevard Coley and Ruturaj Skyquad both shocked centuries to lift India to 358 for six. But despite the strong platform, the hosts couldn't defend the total. The chase stands as the joint sixth highest in ODI history and levels the three-match series at one each. The decider is set for Saturday and this to be followed by a five-match T20 series and we look forward to that. Basketball and indeed fandoms with Los Angeles Cripples have released
