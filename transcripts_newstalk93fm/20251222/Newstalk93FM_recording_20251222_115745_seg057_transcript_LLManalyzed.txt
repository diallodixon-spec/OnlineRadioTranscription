I got the one we could last long. I don't even ever know my chance. Girl, I go the way different night long. I pull up in my high fashion. Every night that shit in any way. We can go ahead and just head out and chill up in my villa I take it out the whole night Just get in the drop top take the head out And cruise with your head outside Go ahead it's your time baby It's your time baby Get by baby That's the difference when you're mine baby That's how it is when you're mine
