When our words and actions align and people take notice, not because we're necessarily perfect, but because we're consistent. Integrity gives credibility to our faith. It allows others to trust what we say because they can see how we live. And Jesus calls his followers to be light. Light doesn't draw attention to itself, it just reveals what's true. And in the same way, integrity reveals the character of Christ through everyday obedience, humility, honesty and love. It is often in ordinary interactions how we treat others, how we handle conflict, how we speak the truth, that God is most clearly seen.
