20251226 133530 We are the ruckus! Oversize them and de-dust us! If a girl's real, then no less! And if a girl's real then no less! Because, we, we, we are dead! We're not dead here, but we're ruckus! We are, we're filled with ruckus! Now we should look here, look where we're going! Need to turn them up, and the money's on display! But I've earned it, so I'm g with justice Now we shed blood, tears, blood, sweat Now we need for the love and the money not the fame But I've earned it, so we give thanks to what we gain We never want the hype over what we top gain Just a worker with a boss and a criminal game Lazy, aim at that **** and we think we're sane Melodic, judge by the lyrics and we'll play Martial arts to the wind Children of the world, we just a game, bring the lane
