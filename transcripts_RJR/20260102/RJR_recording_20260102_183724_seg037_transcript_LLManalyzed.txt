20260102 183724 drowned in the hurricane. So, I mean, that alone, just thinking about how I could have lost my two big sisters, you know, that will live with me for years to come. Every single time I think about how difficult it was for them to get out of their homes and they were inside not knowing that the Barnett River had broken, you know, and had taken over their community. They were saved by their neighbors. Even now, my sister is still staying at my house because her home is not ready. Still not able to move back in. Those are, you know, so, you know, I'm right there with it. Yeah. George, let me bring you in. Good evening ladies and gentlemen. I've never wanted to do the muscle for a year as I want.
