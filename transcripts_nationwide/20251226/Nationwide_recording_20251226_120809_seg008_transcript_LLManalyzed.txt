20251226 120809 Runnin' high, runnin' cold I wasn't runnin' all alone, it was extreme I took it so hard, so low, so low There was nowhere to go, like a bad dream Somehow the white line crossed, it was my turn Never knew I'd had time to let you go I feel it burnin' from my head to my shoes Know when I'm goin' and I know what to do I've had enough and much more to do I've got a new attitude
