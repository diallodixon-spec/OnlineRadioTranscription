20251229 132513 about Cookout, and World Linkup Cookout, and Afterparty. Shout out to Dan P. If it's loving that you want, it's like you're buck up on a ride, young man. Na-na-ho, na- no, no. Cause love don't require certain dirty games. There's too many of your other friends. When I'm on a call, it's too much to do what I have to tell me. Cause nothing that you do is like your buck up on a wrench, young man. No no no no no. Nothing that you switch is for your buck-up on a wrench young man.
