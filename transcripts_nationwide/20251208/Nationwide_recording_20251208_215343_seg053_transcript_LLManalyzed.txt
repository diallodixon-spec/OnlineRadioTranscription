============================================================

We have two particular methods that you can work on. The one here in Canada, if you would like to volunteer to help with all of this kind of work, to help the different organizations who are doing the collecting and all of that part, we have a sheet that you can fill out. If you go onto our website or if you go onto our social media pages, you can get a link. You can click that, enter your details to volunteer about Jamaica's recovery and rebuilding efforts, visit supportjamaica.gov.jm. Thank you for tuning in. I'm Anne-Juie James-Soyers.
