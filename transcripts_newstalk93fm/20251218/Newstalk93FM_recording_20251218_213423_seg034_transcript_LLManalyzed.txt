20251218 213423 Make sense, oh, make sense. Oh my god, I need resistance. Fragrance, I live for my distance. Makes sense, oh, makes sense. Body beat dancing. Controller, controller. I get in mode for my hold up. I make your body slow and I slow down. Put it on your load, no call out down. You know the things I wanna do tonight. Unusual. Put it down, make it to carry your piece of mind. You go flow like water, we get it freeze or black. Open your eyes and look. Look what the hot body can do. Can you see your hot body coming? I see you. Look, look, look. Focus. Look what the hot body can do. Body be dancing. Snow white, so my body so fine. Drive past when I made her inside. To want and I made her inside, makes sense though, makes sense.
