20251217 092317 which we've redeemed at H&L, rapid true value, but we do need so much more for the temporary setup. I know the government will send in surveyors and they're doing the assessments and then they can decide where people will eventually stay and permanent structures will be put up. But I can tell you, there are so many of my people in the West, your people as well, who don't even have good zinc over their houses at this time. So we've had some support, we've had some cash donations that we've put into buying some zinc and all of that, but the needs are so great that we can't have enough. So we are still accepting donations. Thank you as well to Food for the Poor, for the care packages, the hygiene packs. KFC, who provided meals for one of our previous missions, will also provide some more meals for tomorrow.
