============================================================

when the Savior comes I must be prepared when the trumpet sounds for when the light is open many hearts would be broken I want to make sure that my name is written in that Are you really? We often think we're ready for the coming of the law. We often think we're ready for the coming of the Lord. We often think we are walking according to His words. But still we hate our brother and all the soul in church.
