20251222 151411 I don't need it anymore I don't need you anymore See, I don't believe you anymore I believe in a life of love I can feel something inside of me say Really don't think it's strong enough, no. Baby, you live the life of the love. I don't feel the same. It's time to say, really don't think. Take it, take it down.
