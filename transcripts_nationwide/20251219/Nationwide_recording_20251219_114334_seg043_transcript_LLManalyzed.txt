20251219 114334 I don't know if it's a little problem, but I have a problem with JMMB. Yesterday I did a RGTS transfer from another bank. You know RGTS, it takes two hours, right? To JMMB. I never saw it up to last night when I went to bed. So I said, okay, I'll just leave it until in the morning. When I checked this morning, the money wasn't in the JMMB account. So I called the other bank that I transferred the money from. I was told that the money was transferred to JMMB. I said okay, fine.
