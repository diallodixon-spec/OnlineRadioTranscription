**Interview with Councillor Darrington Ferguson**

In a recent interview on Newstalk93FM, Councillor Darrington Ferguson of the Papine Division shared his thoughts on the current state of his division and his expectations for the future. When asked about the cessation of violence in areas such as Augustone, Councillor Ferguson attributed the improvement to the efforts of the police and the community coming together to address the issues.

"I'm very proud of the communities, they are working together, the security forces, you know, you can see the kind of camaraderie and the communication," he said. "There is Inspector Parchment who has been at Augustone Police Station for, you know, the greater part of maybe this year. And he, you know, he's a communicator and a man who is on the ground and who knows community policing well."

Councillor Ferguson also discussed the issue of garbage and littering in the area, particularly on University Road near the Oak Valley Experimental School. He mentioned that they have had conversations with the National Solid Waste Management Authority (NSWMA) and are considering measures such as installing cameras to monitor and enforce littering laws.

When asked about his relationship with the Member of Parliament, Minister of Finance, Honorable Th Favourable Williams, Councillor Ferguson stated that they have a reasonably good relationship and are working together to serve the people of the constituency.

In his Christmas message, Councillor Ferguson emphasized the importance of unity and coming together as a community. "Christmas is the time of giving, is the time for family and friends where we come together and we no matter what it is, how small it is, we are going to give thanks," he said. "I believe in no uncertain way, we are going to come back stronger than before with the kind of unity that I personally will be leading to making sure that all hands are on deck and our development of our different eras is essential in every single man need."

The interview concluded with Councillor Ferguson wishing the listeners a peaceful Christmas and a prosperous New Year, and expressing his commitment to continuing to work towards the development of the Papine Division.
