You know, I don't know that numbers would take it any further than percentages. So people want to know which areas have light and which haven't. And, you know, they're even more anxious to know which areas, how long it will take for them to get light. And I know that the percentage, they don't want to over promise, but, you know, I dunno, I'm not so detained by the percentages as entertained by parishes and areas. So even the percentage within the area or within a parish, and those areas that don't have, those areas that do have, kind of gives you the non-experts like myself a better fix on it, yeah? All right, so I hear you. But the actual numbers rather than percentages, I don't know if that would put a bit more your thing on, Maria,'t know. None the wiser, I think, just the numbers. So, from a cerebral perspective, you know, from a practical perspective, doesn't really change it. This one says more or less the same issue with ecstasy in Cousin's Cove, Hanover.
