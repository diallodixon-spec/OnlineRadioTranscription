I don't wait They don't want me in their proceeding They don't want because I do one way They don't want in their proceeding I ain't don't listen to nothing they say Every breath I drop Jumpin' up Doin' what I want Jumpin' up Tell them I ain't leavin' Right they are sleepin' Every fact I drum Jumpin' up Doin' what I want Jumpin' up Tell them are you livein'? Right they are sleeping Until my phone And I miss a rebel All the money grow I cause in trouble Look how the security watch me They don't know I'm out there I just must have been placed on a deep track like a zombie I don't wait They don't want me in their party day
