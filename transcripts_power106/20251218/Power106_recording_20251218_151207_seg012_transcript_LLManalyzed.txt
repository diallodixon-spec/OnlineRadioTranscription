20251218 151207 All right, so we continue our conversations here on location in the yard. 32 Lindus Road, power 106 FM's Christmas Farmers Market. And I know Peter Thompson was very happy to come on board with this initiative. Mr. Thompson is executive director of the Jamaica Forage Clubs. Mr. Thompson, good afternoon. What a pleasure to see you at my location, sir. It's always a pleasure seeing you wherever you are. Good to have you joining us and good to be able to do this for our listeners and for our farmers because that is what it comes down to. But I don't want to start the conversation talking about the farmer's market. I want to talk about the work that you've been doing on the road out there in the western end of the island through the foundation. How has that process been going? Well, that process is going very well. As a matter of fact, tomorrow we will be going out in Westmoreland.
