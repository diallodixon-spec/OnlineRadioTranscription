20260102 090506 Woyoyoyoyoyo Call me hero Soon as I reach the dance Bad vibes wet Come to play a mass I don't live my life with regrets No, I come to jam on on a bumper, pump to drink out the liquor. Until my head's gone and I'm miserable. All down on the ground, I'm causing trouble. Look how the security watch me. They don't know I'm out there. And it's much of the place under the set like a dream.
