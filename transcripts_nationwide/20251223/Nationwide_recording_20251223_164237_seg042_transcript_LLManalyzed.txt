20251223 164237 Since fame, who do you trust less? Friends or relationships? I would say both. Because people's intentions aren't always pure. True. And they can't really know who is really there for you as a person. Do you regret any of the TikToks you've posted in the heat of the moment? No. You can delete them though? Yes, I don't post and delete. There was this last post that somebody made a post and said that I posted that it was not me.
