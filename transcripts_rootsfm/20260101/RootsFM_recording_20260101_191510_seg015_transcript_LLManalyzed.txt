20260101 191510 I'm trying to explain When I talk to my friends so quietly Who we thinking? That you were too good to me Tennis shoes don't even need to buy a new dress. If you ain't there, ain't nobody else. Sing it, y'all. The beat in my heart's getting out of control. That's you know I'm not the same. It's time to let you know I'm the same.
