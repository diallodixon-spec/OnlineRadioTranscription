20251212 214323 know that it is so. But how can a human being be just before God? If he wants to contend with him, he cannot answer him one time in a thousand. He is wise in heart and mighty in strength. Who has resisted him and succeeded? He is the one who moves mountains, and they do not know how, who overturns them in his anger. He is the One who shakes the earth from its place and its pillars tremble. He is the one who commands the sun and it does not rise, and constellations of the south. He is the one who does great things beyond understanding, and marvelous things beyond number. If he passes by me, I would not see him, and if he should move on, I would not recognize him. If he would snatch away, who could turn him?
