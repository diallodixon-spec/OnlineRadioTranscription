20260101 120305 This is the lowest number of murders in 31 years and well below the psychological barrier of 1,000. This achievement belongs to all of us. It proves that Jamaica can overcome problems once considered impossible to solve. Now, the hurricane also exposed another long-standing challenge, waste management. Our changing lifestyle and consumption patterns have increased the volume and types of waste we generate. This year, we will begin divesting garbage collection, mainstreaming waste separation in public institutions, and instituting a ticketing system for public sanitation and littering. As we make Jamaica safer, we must also make Jamaica cleaner and more beautiful. Jamaica enters this new chapter on stronger footing than at any other time in our history. Our economy is more stable. Our public finances are better.
