20251229 170705 Assistant Commissioner Michael Phipps. The police say it should be noted that Bottom River in Augustown is a known hotspot frequented by migrant criminals. Amid public criticism over the length of the two-year investigation into fraud allegations at investment firm Stocks and Securities Limited, SSL, the security agencies leading the probe say the charges laid over the weekend are the result of extensive financial investigations and coordinated multi-agency efforts. Three former executives of SSL were arrested and charged with several fraud-related offenses on the weekend. They were granted station bail and are due in court on January 26. The accused are former director Hugh Crossgray, former Montego Bay branch manager Sarah Meany, and ex-CEO Zachary Harding. Investigators say the SSL investigation commenced in 2023 after the laying of fraud-related charges against a former SSL employee, Jean Ann Panton, in February of that year.
