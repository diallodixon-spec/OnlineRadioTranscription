20251225 205446 I'm higher than the heavens above I feel good, I feel nice I'm a little bit too silent as well I'm in love, I'm alive Intoxicated, no you aren't Feels like a dream, you're touched, you're tumbling I don't know if it's real But I like the way you feel inside Now I feel like emotions Deeper than I've ever been, yeah Oh, hold me now because I'm in motion Hold me, hold me, hold me In the morning, when I rise To the world, the first day of my life And then I'll be gone
