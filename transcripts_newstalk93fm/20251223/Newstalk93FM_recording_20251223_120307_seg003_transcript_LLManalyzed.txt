20251223 120307 I'm a cannibal friend Until we meet up again Everything on site, you know The bag been packed, you know She dreamin' to take a ride on me Cause she comin' down to please When she ram a chair, she push it back All the bambam rollin' And she savin' some for me I tellin' you I Love whenever you bring a vibe With your hands them up in the sky Watch me drunk and having a time Cannibal time again And we have all money to spend And we go right on to the end Watch me with me cannibal friend Them, them me cannibal friend, friend, friend, Friend, friend, friend, friend. Yeah, yeah. Now we're going to meet up again. Ah! And we meet up and meet up and meet. Rumble beats and beats and beats. Things so sweet and sweet.
