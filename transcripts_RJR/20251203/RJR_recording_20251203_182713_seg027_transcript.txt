joy and happiness that I felt when I saw them get represented. And I thought to myself at the time, you know, me, I want to be somebody like that. I want to be an agent of change in somebody's life like that, even if it's, you know, in the background, you know. And then, you know, I'm from a very stereotyped community. I'm from Flankers in Mont Bay. And, you know, in a community like that, people don't really and truly expect people to become anything. It's a very war-torn community. You know, it's a community marred by violence. Over the years, a lot of scamming and other illicit activities have been taking place there. I've seen where a lot of people who I grew up with, they didn't live a fulfilling life because of the negative impact of the community. Some of them ended up losing their lives.
