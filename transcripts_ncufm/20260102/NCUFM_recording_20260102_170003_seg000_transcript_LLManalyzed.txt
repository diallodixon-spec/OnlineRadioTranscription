20260102 170003 If you don't have a church of your own, I want to invite you to your nearest Seventh-day Adventist Church. Come on and celebrate the Sabbath with us. New Year's Sabbath. Just type it in your Google Maps. Find a Seventh-Day Adventist Church near you. Go there. When they visit, the greeters are talking to you. Tell them your driver from NCUF and Michael Forsyth invited you. When you come back to the show on Monday, let me know how it went. If you worship on a Sunday, make sure you go on a church's Sunday. And let us together pray for our island of Jamaica. Let us together, pray for our families. I tell you, Satan is trying to cause this division. Anyway, on behalf of my producer, Abigail Williams, you, the drive time family, Maxine said, let's go to the Adventist Church news.
