It's just before daylight Victory, when you win it's a sweet story When you're not there the war is bitter You quick to call me a sinner Only judge I know my history So we have to give the king glory Like a tree planted by the river I a smile with the sun, yeah keep it down cause we have to overcome Sleepless nights under pressure got a lot on my mind What would life be without all these struggles of mine Can't sleep on my steam trees for peace of mind I can't sleep
