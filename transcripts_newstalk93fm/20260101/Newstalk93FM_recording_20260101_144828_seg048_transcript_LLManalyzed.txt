20260101 144828 I could be the world to you the missing piece the extra sentimental kind of chemistry some people make it hard with me that isn't the case cause I make it so easy to fall in love so come give me do my hair, the way I make you laugh, the way we like to share a walk in Central Park. I could be fresh air, might be the girl of your dreams. There's no need to hide if you're into me, cause I'm into you.
