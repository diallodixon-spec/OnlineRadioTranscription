20251218 202618 So many things you just do, nobody do me like you do. And you take on my muse. Everything, my baby. My rhythm, my blues. So many things, you did do nobody. Nothing carry, you play happy to lose. Carrying my love, put it all on you. And I get the money, money for two. Over my retina, when you come through. Now you be my personal person. Forget TG, there ain't need blessing. Other guys, they don't teach me lesson. They not only you in the distress, they still not passing. My music and my music. Everything my baby. My rhythm and blues. So many things you didn't do, nobody do me like you do. My music on my music.
