20251224 152017 Merry Christmas, Happy New Year to everyone out there. Wow, and all the very best to you and yours as well, my friend. Yes, sir. It's not the cricket that I'm craving, it's a bad Christmas, but yeah. We got some politics out of the match. Tell me. Because the opening partnership, the first time they go out, eight years, they go on the, and 8 yards again. I think they got 6 yards, 8 yards and 100 yards. It's something like the two Jamaicans. And they soon change it, they soon change it. I can't tell you that. They don't know what they are doing. Well, what I tell you, it is rough. It is rough. But in the first innings I see, what, John Campbell 45 and Brandon King 63? Yeah, that they be counting with that partnership. Who is this Hodge fellow? He's been batting pretty well of late. Who that? Who?
