2025-12-12 10:43:21 As a fitness guy, I was surprised by my chronic illness diagnosis I thought working out hard I would fix it but it wasn't enough now my prescription meds are part of my routine when I got my diagnosis I really felt down and stopped spending time with the people I love then I decided not to let any disease get the best of me and And I'm committed to taking my meds as prescribed. On time. Every time. No hesitation. Take your medication. A message from the NHF. NHF is here for health. NHF is for you. Jamaica is truly special. Our people are strong, resilient and full of love.
