20251226 151515 I was picking up your clothes in the closet I was about to throw your jeans in the washer So I saw a piece piece of paper stayin' touchin' I gotta say, I found this a bitch shoppin' It's some received pair that say you went shoppin' You bought some Nike shoes, but why you buyin' stockings? Boy, how could you lie to me? Thought you would die for me I'm not acceptin' another apology At the screens, I'ma let go Can't stand her, I'm cryin' no more Got your backpack backpack sitting by the door, I'ma leave your heart broken on the floor You gon' be in the emergency room, I'm standing by your bed Don't you dare to pull out your ID You gon' be the in the emergency room I'm fighting with myself, I can't hurt you either
