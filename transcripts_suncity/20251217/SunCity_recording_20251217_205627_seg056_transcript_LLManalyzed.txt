20251217 205627 You filled up my heart with love. Nobody ever touched me like you do. So just fall. Let's forget it all. And baby, make me fall in love once more. Can we fall in love like we did before? Can I show you how much I adore you, babe? Come make me go fall in love The way you love the silence, especially the robot door Can we fall in love like we did before? Happier times in this nostalgic state Am I not for worrying for another lady you've given your time? You gave me your heart, I held it like I died
