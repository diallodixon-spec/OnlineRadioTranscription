20251218 215438 Fireflies lighting our way as we walk Words floating in the summer breeze when we talk What we have is endless Take away all my stress It's so familiar and still so brand new Every day with you feels like deja vu Like we've always known it Loved you before we met. This is a fact. Our love is like summer time. He's in my mind. Our love is Like summer time. Oh, feels so cool to me. This is A fact.
