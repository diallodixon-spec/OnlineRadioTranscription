20251219 162914 And on shadow ground, with no one around, and a blanket of stars in our eyes, we are drifting free by two long sleeves on the crazy wind of the night. And darling, don't say a word, because I already heard your voice saying to mine, and if I want it all night, please say it's all right. Ooh, we've got the time. Because I've got a man with a slow hand. I've got love.
