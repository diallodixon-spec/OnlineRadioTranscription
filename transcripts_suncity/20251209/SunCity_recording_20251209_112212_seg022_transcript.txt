I swear, Bridgeport, we need a little more time in Bridgeport. Yeah, lunch will be served on December the 10th. So you know, tomorrow at lunch, they might clear out the lunch and get the thing out of the way. You understand? Yeah. They might get the lunch things out of the way from Shirley. Here comes the whole Bridgeport family. This one, it's the annualbecue and after party. It's a splash event. I'm telling you, it's different. It's a color-coded and foam and water party event. You know, dancing rebel upon the scene, you know. You know what I mean? A lot of place have a rain. A lot of rain upon the ground. Peeps do remember three toes at the gate. Bridgeport. You know alright, that's just how you can relate. Hosted by a million dollar voice. Yeah, the people's choice. Hey, large blast up, Next Gen. Some music from DJ Optic on Next Gen, it is.
