20251217 113524 of Christmas Day. Mary's boy child, Jesus Christ, was born on Christmas Day. While shepherds watch, they flock by night, they see a bright new shining star. They hear a choir, sing a song, The music seemed to come from afar Heart now hear the angels sing A king was born today And man will live forevermore because of Christmas Day.
