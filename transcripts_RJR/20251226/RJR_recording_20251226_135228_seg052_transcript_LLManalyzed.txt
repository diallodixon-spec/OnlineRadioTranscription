20251226 135228 I've got to do it the traditional way which is I've got to get the phone, the literal phone and do it because when I know I'll go flat me on the box on the birthday. Alright, I've got you guys just one second. Here we are. Solji, is it your birthday today? I think it's Solji's birthday, you know. Solji in Detroit? Yes! Noel Cardoza aka Soji is celebrating his birthday today. Soji, are you celebrating here in Jamaica or are you in Detroit? It's been a long time you didn't send me to Detroit with a check in. Let me know what's going on with the people over there. Happy birthday my friend. I hope you're having an awesome one. I know you're someone when it comes to these special days you put on your hand on the hey hey you know. So I know it's nice. This one's an anniversary greeting. Paul and Kareen Friedanke. Yes I'm sure what I say church.
