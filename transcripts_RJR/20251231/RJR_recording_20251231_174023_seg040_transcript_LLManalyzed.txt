20251231 174023 shelter would be closed by the end of December based on the pronouncements that were made. So what is this? I don't know what is going on, what kind of world we know. Okay, so we want to talk about changes that have been made as far as green card holders are concerned, talking of course about people holding green cards from the United States. And we know, Sir, Holyfoot Jamaicans fall into that category. We're now hearing of new travel restrictions and enforcement protocols at immigration. And joining us now to bring us up to date on all of that, we have Dr. Erwin Clare, director of the New York-based Caribbean Immigrant Services. Erwin, Clare, always a great pleasure. Thank you so much for talking to us. Did I hear you misspeak just now? Did you call me doctor? I'm reading what's on my paper. You're not doctor? I was wondering. Okay, my apologies. Not one of those at all. I'm not that privileged.
