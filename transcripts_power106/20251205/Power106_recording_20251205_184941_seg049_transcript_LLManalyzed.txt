Okay, we're now joined by our analyst Mr. Dwayne Richard, Chief Executive of Yardy Sports. Good evening to you Dwayne, welcome. Good evening Cleopon, good evening to the listeners. All right, great. We're going to go to the English Premier League. We have lost a bit of time here, but let's do this cool football. As I understand it, two of the most recent champions have been sent packing. Say that again please? Two of the most recent champions have been sent packing. Is that a fact? They are Gavin Marcello and Kingsland College. Both teams are contests. Ben Francis and the Walker Cup respectively. They're out of contention of retaining their titles. Okay. Interesting. And anything of significance, anything else happening in terms of upsets or people doing better than expected?
