20251216 173928 for a murder in Jamaica and citizens can go up there and tell him listen you arrested the wrong man I know I was there it's unrealistic and it makes it looks as though she didn't really see and witness the thing that is why she didn't do those things and that's not real that's not in the real world in Jamaica nobody feels that they can and have a duty to go to the police and tell them to release John Brown because it is another person who I saw doing it. And that left the jury to think that here is the Chief Justice, a senior judge, the top of the judiciary. If he's taken this position, they may begin to think that it is true that she ought to have gone up there and influenced the police. And that was wrong. And as CJ has said, the jury would have been left to think that she had no credit, she really was not a good witness. And we know that the system is that a defense need not call any witnesses.
