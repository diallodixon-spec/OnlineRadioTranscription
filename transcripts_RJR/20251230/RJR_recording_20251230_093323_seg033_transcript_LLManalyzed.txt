20251230 093323 I'm good sir, how you doing? We've got one day and a few hours to go. I'm giving thanks. You know we're at this stage in life, you know. We appreciate every moment. You know, we'll take for granted. We are better. We are better, I tell you. You are not very interested. Hello? What do you mean? Oh dear dear dear. Seem to have lost baron there, you know. I hope you can get us back. We've lost the connection. Alright. Okay, let's try again. Good morning. Welcome to Hotline. This is Clive Mulling. Hi, Clive. How are you? I'm good, thanks. Welcome. What's up? I heard you're reading a report about accidents. Yes. And the results of it. And bike operators are carrying the highest percentage of accidents. Am I right?
