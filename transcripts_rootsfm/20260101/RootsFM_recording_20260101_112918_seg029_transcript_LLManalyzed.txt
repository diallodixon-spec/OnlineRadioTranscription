20260101 112918 where you're at today. And I've been hanging by the telephone hoping that you'll call home and say, you told me you needed more words, more talks, more feeling close to me. I want to be close to you. I didn't know you needed some roses, some romance, a little candlelight, and slowly, that's not how it feels. Maybe we can try again. Try, try. Maybe we could try again. I remember all the days gone by.
