20251215 123724 I don't know. There is some detail as to what's happening there and what are the challenges, if any. You know, we have to be on top of what's happening in terms of leptospirosis outbreak, you know. I'm concerned about it because water, you see, water is life. Water is indeed life. It's not just the quaint thirst, but so many other things that we rely on water to do. So I want to say season's greetings to you and to all the staff at RGR. I am concerned with a large boulder that's in the Medina district that's around a corner near to the primary school. It is very dangerous and we are appealing for help from the authorities or anybody with a front-end loader to assist us to move it as quickly as possible.
