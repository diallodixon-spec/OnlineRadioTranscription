20251229 115530 Yeah, I don't know what happened. Oh's not going to go away. What you call that type of wish? What kind of wish it is? Not willful. It's not practical. Anyway, I don't want to get credit and I don't want it to be cut off. So I just wish you all the best for this year and for the new year. We'll talk more wonderful things to talk about and we wish those of us in the distant end that they will keep up and we will see them in the new year. Absolutely. You stay safe, all right? Yes. And good to hear you.
