Hey, Mr. Big Shot, carrying on my cap When I come right from here and bow down This is no pop shot, sure ain't no soft stop See, we come to turn the world around We're constructive, we're not destructive No No, you can't be, son, and stop this mission. Son, you can't watch, but don't you try to catch it. Oh, the stars feel like a rocket right in the pocket. They're running here like a rocket rocket Right in the pocket It's a hot shot Hotter than a bomb shot It's a hard shot You better watch out
