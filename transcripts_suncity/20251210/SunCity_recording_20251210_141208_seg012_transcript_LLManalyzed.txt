Love her so much, so me treat her with such tenderness, she and me baby. Cause I believe that love is a powerful thing, feeling deep within. And if you believe in love, free up your mind, let this go within. As early as the morning star, I'm giving thanks for this lovely thing. And if I ever dream me a dream, I won't wake up, because you're still holding no other girl can hold me hold me hold me so tight yet baby None of them ever please me sir treat me sir Lord you feel so right No girl never squeeze me squeeze me squeeze me so tight're like, ooh, sir, ooh, sir. Girl, you shine so bright, yeah. She's the flower in the garden. Pretty little, pretty little, pretty, pretty little baby.
