============================================================

And if I'm turning blue, please don't save me Nothing left to lose without my baby Birds have a feather, we should stick together And I said I'd never think I wasn't better alone Can't change the weather, might not be forever But if it's forever, it's even better And I don't know what I'm crying for I don't think I could love you more It might not be long, but maybe I I'll love you till the day that I die Till the day that it dies Till the light leaves my eyes Till the day that I dies
