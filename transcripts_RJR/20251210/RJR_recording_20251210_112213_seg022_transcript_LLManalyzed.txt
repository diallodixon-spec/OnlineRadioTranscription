patient with the people. Because we want to know how the money will be recovered. Alright, these young people who are driving are high. Saturday night, gone, I was driving approaching a single lane when all of a sudden one riding a bike chose at that time to overtake. He could be on the dual section but chose to be on the single lane. They're crazy. And he was also carrying a passenger. They want to make it seem as if I bad-ride him. Well, you know, I remember some years ago, I had a Mini. Yeah, the original Mini. It was a little 1000 but I'd done some work on it. I put on the cylinder head for my MG that I had, MG Midget. So it had a double SU carburetor at some speed, not particularly fast. I mean, my Virgin had a 1275 GT.
