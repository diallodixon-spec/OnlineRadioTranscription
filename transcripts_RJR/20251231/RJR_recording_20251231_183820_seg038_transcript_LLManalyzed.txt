20251231 183820 say oh you did not know you were allergic I said doctor I never had lobster in my life. So when a lot of people you know what I would see a lot of people eating lobster eating fish or eating salmon and and turning it back and say it was too cold Dion give me the plate. I never had that when I was growing up. So you look at life from a different lens and so that's why when I when I see people turning back food because it's too cold or it's too hot or it's not cooked properly I'm just like you spoil because in Jamaica would I eat that up? Just put like a curry on it, make it more seasoned and carry it home or re-cook it, you know what I'm saying? So my life growing up was one of just pain and that's what actually brought me to Florida because I had gotten a single entry visa first, went to the United States
