20260101 114426 I would wait forever for those lips of a wine. Build my world around you, darling. This love will shine, girl. Watch and see. If you give a little more than you're asking for, your love will turn to key. I just want to be your everything. Open up the heaven in your heart and let me be The things you are to me and not some puppet on a string If I stay here without you, darling, I would die I want you laying in the love I have to bring I'd do anything to be your raincoat
