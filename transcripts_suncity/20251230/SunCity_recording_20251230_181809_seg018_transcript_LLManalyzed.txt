20251230 181809 I should say, it is a luxury, elegant, and you will definitely have unforgettable vibes at this event, all right? Music by Sun Jack, Crazy Dean, and Nonstop Retro Vibes. Admission $10,000 for couples and $6,000 for singles. I really hope my Sunites get the chance to attend this event and we're still in the sponsored hour provided by this awesome inclusive event. So until the promoter notify me as to who won the tickets, I'm going to be playing some music.
