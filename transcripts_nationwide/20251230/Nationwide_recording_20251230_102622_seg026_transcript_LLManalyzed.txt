20251230 102622 I wasn't going to partake in a meal of unsweetened porridge, I'm sorry. As healthy as that option is, nobody wants to drink unsweetened porridge. nice nice cooked-down chicken with the Shelly white rice that way I serve you know the quiz this year so just get with it and just just work with the fun support your contestant and you not take it serious because we don't okay it's good fun as I want to say thanks to oh say happy birthday to my granny who passed who would have celebrated her birthday today, September 26. She would have been 91 had she stayed this long. It's the woman that I owe everything to.
