And so my love is beautiful, but it's not enough To satisfy emotions that are shared between us I want to love as cozy, but I need so much more It just intensifies my wants to have a love that endures Because every time I close my eyes I think of you And no matter what the season is I still love you Ooh, it's all in my heart And I wanna be with you Wherever you are I wanna think of you On two occasions That's day and night I'd go for broke If I could be with you Only you
