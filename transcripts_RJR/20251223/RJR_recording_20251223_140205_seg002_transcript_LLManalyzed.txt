20251223 140205 Cultural Development Authority, RADA, is encouraging a measured, soil-focused approach to restoring crop production following heavy rains. Senior Plant Health and Food Safety Officer with RADA, Francine Webb, said composting and careful soil management will be critical as topsoil in parishes heavily affected by the passage of Hurricane Melissa has been displaced. She said in an interview, they are encouraging farmers to do composting because that is going to be important. Ms. Webb said farmers should allow soils to dry properly before re-entering fields, noting that premature activity can worsen existing damage. The Eastern Caribbean Central Bank, ECCB, is projecting growth in the Eastern Caribbean Currency Union, ECCU, to be between 3 and 4 percent this year. The ECCU consists of eight island nations and territories, namely Anguilla, Antigua and Barbuda, Dominica, Grenada, Montserrat, St. Kitts and Nevis, St. Lucia and St. Vincent.
