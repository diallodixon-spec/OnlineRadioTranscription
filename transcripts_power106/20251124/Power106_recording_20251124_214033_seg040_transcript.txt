and we pass through some villages and the coconut trees, they blow down the whole stuff, they blow off the same waker. And nobody mentions nothing in the news or in their bulletin or nothing about the Rasta community and the Maroons. And those are the only set of people who are less looked about. And they have needs too, but just because the maroon woods and the rasta don't, they're already not going to fill it up for their corn friends. I don't know if that's why they don't remember we exist, but we are resilient, you know, because a rasta didn't say eat what you grow and grow what you eat. Michael didn't take it and run with it. So we are accustomed to that. We always have our vineyard where we plant all little things. We don't just depend on going to supermarkets.
