We have learned quite a bit, but bird flu has impacted dairy cattle. It can spread from animals to humans. The reverse is not very common. But we need to think beyond birds. We know that's a likely introduction, but we need to think much more beyond birds. And all dogs, cats, cows, mink, we don't have mink in Jamaica really, but all species of birds, we just have to be very careful and be unalert because we know that this can cross over and can impact other species than birds, including humans. So we're crossing our fingers and hoping this doesn't get here.
