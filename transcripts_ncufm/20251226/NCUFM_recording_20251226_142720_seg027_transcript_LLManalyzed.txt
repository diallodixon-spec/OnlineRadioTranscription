20251226 142720 but there is no sunshine nothing but clouds and it's dark in my heart and it feels like a cold night today's a new day but where are my blue skies where is the love and the joy that you promised me tell me it's all right i'll be honest with you. I almost gave up a power that I can't explain. Fell from heaven like a shower. When I think how much better I'm going to be when this is over. Even though I hurt, see I smile. I know God is working so I smile. Even though I've been here for a while, I smile. Come on and smile. It's so hard to look up when you're down. Show and hate to see you give up now. God's people.
