I would just want to say thank you so very much for the contribution that you made while you were here. We value it and I know the listeners will miss you and we will miss you as well but we just want to wish you bon voyage. Thank you. Wow. Alright. Um let me first say farewell on behalf of the extended news family. Tiffany, it was a pleasure having you here but I want to insert my personal farewell I'm thinking about when we were doing that recording was it what was it that we had in studio we had to work was it 14 and 14 Tiffany you are hilarious you are hilarious
