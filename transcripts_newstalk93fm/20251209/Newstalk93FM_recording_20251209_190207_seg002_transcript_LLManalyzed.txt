We gonna rock this club, we gonna go all night We gonna light it up, like it's dynamite Cause I told you once, now I told you twice We gon' light it up, Like it's dynamite I got this feeling on the summer day when you were gone I crashed my car into the bridge and watched a lady driver I threw your **** into a bag and pushed it down the stairs I crashed my car onto the bridge I don't care I love it I don't care, I love it, I don't care I got this feeling on a summer day when you were gone I crushed my car into the bridge, how much did I let it burn? I threw your slot into her back and pushed it down the stairs I crushed my car onto the bridge
