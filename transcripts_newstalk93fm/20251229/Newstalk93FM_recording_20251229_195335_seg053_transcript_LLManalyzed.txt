20251229 195335 I want to be in your life until the night is over. I want to hold you so tight, so tight, coming closer. It's been a hell of a ride, but every single moment, you were there by my side. Whenever I'm broken, you make me feel whole. Whenever I'm lonely, you're there for my soul Wherever you are, girl, that's why I call my own Whenever you doubt it, I'll be letting you know Girl, I want to be dancing with you forever You see through the storm and take me as I am Baby it's magic anytime that we're together I make I just love you and hold you for my hand Hold you for my hand
