20251219 173429 I don't know about you but I come here to fete Come to play a match I'm not leaving until I wet Come to play a mass I don't live my life with regrets, no I come to jam on a bumper Come to drink out the liquor Until my head gone and I'm miserable All down on the ground, I'm causing trouble Look how the security watch me, they don't know about me I just smash up the place and I defect like a zombie And to one way, they don't want me in their party They don't want me cause I do one way They don't want me in their posse, they don't want me cause I choose one way. They don't want in their posse. I ain't don't listen to nothing they say. Every fact I draw, jumping up, doing what I want, jumping up. Tell them I ain't leaving, right they are sleeping. Every fact I do, jumping up.
