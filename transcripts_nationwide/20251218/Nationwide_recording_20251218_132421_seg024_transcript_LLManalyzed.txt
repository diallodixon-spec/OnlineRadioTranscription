20251218 132421 Pretty little baby Pretty little baby You say that maybe You'll be thinking of me And try to love me Pretty little baby I'm hoping that you do You can ask the flowers I sit for hours Telling all the bluebirds, the billy cool birds Pretty little baby, I'm so in love with you Now is just the time, while both of us are young Puppy love must have its day Don't you know it's much more fun to love While the heart is young and gay Meet me at the car hop or at the pop shop Meet me in the moonlight or in the daylight
