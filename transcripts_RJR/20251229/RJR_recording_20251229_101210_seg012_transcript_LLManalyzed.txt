20251229 101210 So I said, in this country where people, crime must go, because when I look at it and see it, when you have issues and different ministries, nobody is stepping in to help. I'm 72 years old and I don't have a pension when I look at my pension a truck, you know, when I work, you know. I'm a contract with different countries, companies here in Jamaica, you know. Get water, I get water from the water commission here, they come down to me, you know. They don't give no notice now. No notice now. Should I send all the information that I have to the regional officer, you know? And they have traction in the community and they can't come and assist me. So what am I going to do now? No, just tell me. Because my road license is still on.
