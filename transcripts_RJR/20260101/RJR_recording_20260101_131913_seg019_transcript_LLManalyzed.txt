20260101 131913 I know you must tamper, not sit down and grumble. I know so you're tired when you're tingling life. Now if you run go, you better be gamble. Cause life is a gamble like a rolling dice. Now if you don't be tired, now I'm not living here. Now I'm nowhere to be sleep with such a night. So you better be easy, and just judge and believe me me Cause just like glass rust, the place in a turmoil The family ball, when you're losing life Church will go by the grave, sign and roll by the tombstone And sell us a rose, come you better rise So you see in your life, better open your eyes When you're blessing at the door, just it inside tell them all the why, the child's always on time cause when the high of the storm is before you and the tundras come rolling with rain
