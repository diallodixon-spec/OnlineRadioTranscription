20251217 120807 I've been drinking more, oh, for the past five days Did you check on me? Now did you look for me? I walked in the room, eyes are red and I don't smoke banga Did you check on, did you check on me, now did you notice me? Nobody will know the power no way out Cause I put a smile on my face A facade you can never face And if you don't know me well, well, well You won't see how buried I am inside my grave Inside my grave Cause you see people, people, people People don't really know you
