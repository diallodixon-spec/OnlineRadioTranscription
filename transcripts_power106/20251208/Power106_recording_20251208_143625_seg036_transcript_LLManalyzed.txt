So what happens is that persons end up losing their property if the property is quote unquote abandoned, neglected for at least 12 years. There's no one living there. There's nobody taking care of it, farming it, fencing it, bushing it, absolutely nothing. And for many of us, it seems, you know, unrealistic. Like how can you have land and nothing happens to it for 12 years? And believe it or not, it's quite common. So for whatever the reason, if you are unable to intricately go to your land to take care of it, rent it out. If it's even for a dollar a month. For someone to go there ever so often, just to look see what's happening. To bush it. Fence it up. Put up no trespassing signs. But those that say you fenced it and you put up a no trespassing sign, that's not enough. There needs to be some physical presence established on your life.
