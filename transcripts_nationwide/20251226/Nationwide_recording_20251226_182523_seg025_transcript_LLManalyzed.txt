20251226 182523 When the moment's sad, I still see But now we're stressed out Used to break the chain, used to break the chain for me Used to break, the chain break, break, break Used to break the train, used to break, the train for me Used to beat the train, beat the train for me Well you can tell everybody Yeah you can tell everybody Go ahead and tell everybody I'm the man, I'm the manid with every heart that I ever stole Paid my card and I didn't fold But it ain't that hard when you got soul This is my world Somewhere I heard that Life is a test I've been through the worst But I still get my bed God made my mold Different from the rest It broke then more So I know I'm blessed This is my world
