20260101 153927 On the road again Life I love is making music with my friends I can't wait to get on the road again On the road again Goin' places that I've never been Seein' things that I may never sing again I can't wait to get on the road again on the road again like a band of gypsies we go down the highway we're the best of friends insisting that the world keep turning our way and our ways on the road again I just can't wait to get on the road again The life I love is making music with my friends And I can't wait to go on the road again
