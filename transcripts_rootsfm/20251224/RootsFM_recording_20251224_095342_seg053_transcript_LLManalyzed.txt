20251224 095342 All right, Marcy? Yes, yes, yes. Thanks to our valid listeners for stopping by this morning. We couldn't have done it without you until next week or next year. Special thanks to Rousseff and Timos to the engineer, Dwight Ehrin. My quote I want to leave you with is, it's from James 1 to 17. Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the father the bells of Christmas the next Wilderness Wednesday with Isis Isis Miller. Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year. And hopefully we have a special 20, 20, 26. Right, and we say Happy Kwanzaa. Happy Kwanza.
