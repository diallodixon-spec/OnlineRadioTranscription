20251217 135552 that we're bringing in all these new players in order to bring down the cost of electricity to consumers. Jamaica, right now, back before the PNP took over, we were paying like how much, maybe upward of 50 cents per US cents per kilowatt hour. I think the PNP managed to bring it down to I think 25 or so. Since they've come back, it has been going up back and probably reached back where it is. So despite all we're told about they're going to bring in new players, they're going to use different fuel, and that will reduce the cost, and we're going to bring it down. All we end up doing in Jamaica is paying more for this commodity. Now you mention it to mega companies that are involved and you're asking the question why aren't they allowed to get money? Why we have to foot it? Jamaica
