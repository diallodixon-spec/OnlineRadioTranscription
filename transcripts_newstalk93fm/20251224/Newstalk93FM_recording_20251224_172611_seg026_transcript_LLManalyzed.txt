20251224 172611 It feels good to love somebody And somebody loves you back But it feels one sided now It feels one sided now You don't have to return about it Cause it's crystal glad now now now. Guess it's bye to the good times. I'll be gone by the sunrise. I'll be better on my own. Nobody should call my phone. This is my last heartbreak song. I'll be good on my own. Why are you so quick to leave When we both can make it worse When I'm gonna make you nervous
