20260101 144034 Don't let the waiting be too long Can hardly wait a minute more Say excuse to the crew you're with Come clear out that I've caught this All night I've been uptight And then you're in sight And then I'm alright Because you're so clean if you know what I mean I mean to hold you and never let go You need to be here in my arms With your head on my shoulder
