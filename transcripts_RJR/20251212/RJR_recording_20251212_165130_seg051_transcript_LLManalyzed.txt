20251212 165130 We forgive but don't forget Lucky some of them feel lucky we don't carry vengeance Different from all the rest If you say a word to us, we say a sentence And prison them all with death We don't want to see them, we don't see them in tensions And we'll push them out of their mess I hear them say, I hear them say All they do is drink and smoke weed all day They don't even know the order we want to pave They want to fool themselves and think we're not safe The official way. Living my life like a man.
