20251225 102113 Now we in the cold weather And the families together Gathering round the fire Caroling like a choir If love's the gift we share Then we don't need to care about a season Cause we always got a reason To give ourselves away To give ourselves away We don't need lights we don't need snow we've got the faith and we've got the hope and through the years we don't have to wait because it's Christmas every day and when you're here the angels sing let the love in your heart be the gift you bring let's put a smile on someone's face Now it's Christmas every day Now it's Christmas everyday
