20251212 174233 Like you do I want the whole wide world to see You are beautiful to me I love my chocolate skin You better love yourself, don't hate yourself Embrace yourself my dear Cause you look beautiful in every single thing you wear. Stay just the way you are, don't you change a thing. Ooh, there's power in your Melanie. I know you got me, got me in a trap. Cause every time I keep coming back Cause they don't got a thing on you And they can glow just like you do And I want the whole wide world to see
