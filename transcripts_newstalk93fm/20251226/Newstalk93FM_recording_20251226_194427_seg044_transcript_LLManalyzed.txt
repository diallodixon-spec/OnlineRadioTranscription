20251226 194427 I have a lightning spirit Early in the morning I hat it Me cooler ready, me eyes done ready Me punching that's automatic I have a lightning jumbie A kind of energy inside me And it ready for the rum Ready ready for the rum, let we go It's action time, let we go, it's bacchanal time, here we come! Hands up! This sweating spirit havin' me feelin' good!
