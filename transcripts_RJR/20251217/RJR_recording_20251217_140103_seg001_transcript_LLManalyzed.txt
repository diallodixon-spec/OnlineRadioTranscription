20251217 140103 The Caribbean Development Bank has received another strong vote of confidence from international credit rating agency S&P Global Ratings. S&P has affirmed the bank's long-term issuer credit rating at AA plus while improving its short-term issuer rating to A1 plus, both with stable outlook. The agency says the ratings reflect its expectation that the CBD will maintain strong capitalization and a solid business profile over the next two years as the Caribbean's preferred development lender. According to S&P, the decision follows a review under its updated methodology for multilateral lending institutions. Frank James, chairman of the Grace Kennedy Group Limited, says the company's 42-46 Harbor Street headquarters will be renamed the Don Webby Building, speaking at a function to mark Webby's induction into the PSOJ's Hall of Fame on Monday night.
