2025-12-11 17:38:20 78th minute and they throw in the Costa Cup champions, Garvey Maseo and the Manning School. They've both gotten buys into the next round of the competition as a result of the withdrawal from Maldon. Newly minted Caribbean champions Mount Pleasant Academy, they ran right in the rare Nephew Jamaica Premier League at Draxall on Thursday afternoon. They blew away, literally blew away, Tivoli Gardens by five goals to nil in their midweek schedule. There's another goal rush here in Kingston. At the stadium Eastfield, to be exact, Harbourview and Montego Bay United scored eight goals between them. They shared the points in a 4-4 draw. The Champions Cavalier, they're in action at the minute as well. They're playing Mullines United in at Jerusalem, the home of Waterhouse, and it's goalless after just about 27 minutes in the game, and coming up a little later on in the late kickoff, Waterhouse, they'll take on Portmore United in a major, major clash. That one will kick off at half past seven.
