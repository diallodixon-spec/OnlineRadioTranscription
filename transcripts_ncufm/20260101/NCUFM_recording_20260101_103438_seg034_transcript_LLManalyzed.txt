20260101 103438 I remember my Redeemer Who has always been by your own tower And has never leave my side Oh, I'm still here In spite of my hurt, in spite of my pain, in spite of all I've gone through Oh, oh, oh, oh I'm still here Nobody's gonna take me away, Lord I'm still here I may not have money, I may not have fame But Lord, i'm still here
