20251230 092216 Before the hurricane We didn't we weren't getting it a year a year to update the stuff all and especially when rain fall You know, we know get what that came as when rain fall because of whatever issues they have been over there and they must chuck water to us and if we can't get the water we're gonna we want water One second because as know, a lot of rivers up that side. Hold it, right? Seven rivers and so on. At the best of times, what happens? Is it that you get water on an off or what? As I told you, sir, they say it's a filter problem. I went three filter them over there, as well when they explained to me. They go down to two and they go down to one. and then sometimes they have to take out the one car, come a man to go there, come clean it, and carry it back up there. So in the best of times, we don't have any water, and no, we don't any light, and we don't have, and we want water, and we want road. We want road, we want Montpelier Road.
