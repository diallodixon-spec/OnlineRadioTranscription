If you or someone you know is struggling, reach out, talk to someone you trust, or call the Mental Health and Suicide Prevention Helpline at 888-NEW-LIFE. That's 888-639-5433. Support is available. Take care of your mental wellness. A message from the Ministry of Health and Wellness and UNICEF. Hi, I'm Stephen Price, VP and General Manager.
