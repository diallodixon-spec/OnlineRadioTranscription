2025-12-11 18:26:46 The staff from Samaritan's Purse are scheduled to leave at the end of this month. Field hospitals are also operational at the Noel Holmes Hospital in Hanover and the Savannah-Lymar Hospital in Westmanland. Speaking at a press conference today, Chief Medical Officer Dr. Jacqueline Becesa-Mackenzie disclosed that the ministry has sought an operational extension for one of the field hospitals. In Hannover, we also have another field hospital that is being operated by the Spanish team. And that field hospital is presently housed in the Accident and Emergency Department. That hospital is expected to leave in January. Right now, the date is for the 9th of January, but we are expecting an extension on this date. And when that field hospital moves over, the Accident and Emergency Department will return to the space at the hospital that previously housed the Accident & Emergency Department.
