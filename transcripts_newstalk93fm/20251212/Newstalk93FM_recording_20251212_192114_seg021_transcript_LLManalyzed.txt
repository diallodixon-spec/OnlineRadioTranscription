20251212 192114 Sweet woman, we have it Greatest on the planet, boy Suck for the radio love Playin' a song and it goes in the fuck And if I lose myself inside this place Well I show my shit off If this hookah unblast When the beat drop past The madness won't stop Just give me one more shot Inside my glass and watch me level off Fitting like a hero Call me hero As I raise my hand I'll leave the're from We get these powers from this same nation. Sweet like steel drum, dismiss these vibrations. Don't let the rhythm get you, just run, run, run. Even you could handle it, your man. But like when the mat will hide, we gon' rip it up a spine.
