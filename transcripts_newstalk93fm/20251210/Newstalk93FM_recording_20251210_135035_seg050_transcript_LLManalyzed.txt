============================================================

I'm not faking this, no fugazi. You see these feelings, I'm not catching. I'm a quest on business, I'ma shine your ego bright, fall like F for the night. No, no, no. Ah, business, if I'm broke now, my business, I'll shine your ego bright. Fall like F, for the night. F-I-N-E-S-S-E, if it be the reason why your papa want to jealous me. If he want to take I'm serious, I'll do thought speed. No need to resonate, I'm on a different frequency. I don't think it's necessary. I be damned if there's somebody that could do like me. When I be like Mo Salah coming up the right wing, I call to your defender. You don't need to tell me. I'm a finesse. And you know, same here, I'm a snitch. And you can let me carry you.
