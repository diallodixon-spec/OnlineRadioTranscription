20251224 201111 Now come on kids, I want you to gather around me and fold your legs on the floor and we're gonna tell the story about the first Christmas. All right Chico, open your book. Joy, Barry, Terry, everybody open your book and we're gonna sing the song. And when I say ding and dong I want you to say the same thing with me. All right? Ready? Uh-uh. Now open clear, spreading word the Savior's here. Humble men kneel down to pray on this very day.
