20251216 092721 are people who said listen they are not trusting of the numbers and even the police themselves always said listen there is a percentage of murder that may not have been captured on their radar you know so people tend to put a little bump up there also but there is no doubt at all in my mind that the numbers the crime numbers have reduced you know one would remember when we were hearing about five six murders we still have that from time to time but it used to be somewhat of a staple you know and we have seen the reduction of that granted Granted, when you talk about a small space like Jamaica, when we're talking about 700 murders, it is certainly a shame on us, you know. It is a shame
