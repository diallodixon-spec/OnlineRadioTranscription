20251231 163828 I never make a promise I don't intend to keep So when I say forever Forever's what I mean Well, I ain't no Casanova But I swear this much is true I'll be holding nothing back When it comes to you You dream of love that everlasting. Well, baby, open up your eyes. I can love you like that. I will make you my world, move heaven and earth. If you were my girl, I would give you my heart. Be all that you need. Show you your everything. That's precious to me. If you give me a chance, I can love you forever.
