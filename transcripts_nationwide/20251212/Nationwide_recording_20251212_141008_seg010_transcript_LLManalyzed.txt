2025-12-12 14:44:04 YouTube community. The YouTube has stepped up big time. I don't want to say thanks. Can I also say good afternoon to the scores of listeners who have come up to us here on location to make it known that this is their station. Yes. This is what they listen to all the time. I have to admit a sense of pride and humility. Yeah, to know that so many people who are strangers to us in the regular cut and thrust, consider us family. Thank you all so much. Thank phone. All right. Okay. That long list of people to say thank you to the team here on location. Cliff Hughes, of course, is here. I don't know if I should tell him. Thanks. I'm not doing much work this morning, but Norah did a lot of work. So thank you, Norah.
