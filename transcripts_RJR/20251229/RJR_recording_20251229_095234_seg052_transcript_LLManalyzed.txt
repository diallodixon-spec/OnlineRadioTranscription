20251229 095234 What are you doing? I'm doing very well, thank you. How is the holiday going with you? It's quiet and of course I'm happy about that. I must confess, over the past few years, it's become increasingly quiet. And I love it this way. Right, that is true, that is true. The topic of discussion on the sunny side of this morning helped me understand. It was about the police in world traffic, Mr. Thompson. Now, I heard the police commissioner down, speaking and reveling in the success of the decrease in crime and shootings etc. We're not hearing corresponding arguments, discussions on the road traffic, mishaps and failures by the police.
