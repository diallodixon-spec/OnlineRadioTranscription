20251230 184830 in Casablanca on January 3. After a goalless first half, home side Arsenal were ahead inside three minutes of the second period through Emiliano Martinez as they thumbed Aston Villa 4-1 to end the year 5 points clear atop the English Premier League standings on Tuesday. Arsenal doubled their advantage on 52 minutes after Martinez. Zubemendi converted Martin Odegaard's exquisite defence splitting pass, with Leandro Trassade scoring from long range after 69 minutes to put the game firmly out of Villa's reach. Gabriel Asus then netted his first goal since New Year's Day just moments after coming on as a substitute. Ollie Watkins scored a consolation for the visitors in injury time. The impressive victory was a perfect tonic for Michael Arteta's players against a team that dealt them a stoppage time 2-1 defeat at Villa Park just 24 days ago.
