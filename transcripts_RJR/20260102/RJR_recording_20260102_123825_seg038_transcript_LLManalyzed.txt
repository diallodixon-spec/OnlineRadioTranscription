20260102 123825 the government is giving the church $75 million to help rebuild when there are so many hungry and homeless people in the country. I am on poor relief and I get $5,300 every two months. I'm unable to work. I was begging $21,300 to pay for my daughter's CXCs in 2024. No one helped. She didn't get to do them. She can't get to work. In 2025, I was begging for a sewing machine, refrigerator, and a little TV. Mr. Mullins read my text several different times, but no one helped. Someone, please, I need some help help I would encourage you to reach out to the church same church that can assist especially given some of the needs that you have expressed good day mr. Earl
