Hey, girl, what's up? So, hold on. Why you look so vexed this early? They ain't had just talked. Lisa, it is so good to see you. But sorry you catch me like this, girl. My uncle said when I'm bailing, when my family go for clarity, you don't want to hear the cries of the people they put upon or something. Make matters worse, me hear say half of the thing they're missing. And me know say a custom. Girl, how you know say a customs? Lisa, stop going like you're not having a sense, man. You're not saying everybody has talked about it in the media. You know, I'm not going to stop listening to you, sir. You ever experience that? Customs don't go into your package, suitcase, barrel or cargo unless you worship the item or the agent stand up right there when they're inspecting it. Listen, a customs job is to protect the borders, collect revenue and to facilitate trade. They don't collect or store shipment, they inspect it and somebody has to present it for inspection. So how customs ever get so much custom then?
