20251216 165447 Gonna be the hardest thing I think I ever had to do Got me talking to myself, asking how I'm gon' tell you Bought that chick on part one, I told y'all I was creepin' with Creepin' with, say she's three months, she's keepin' it The first thing that came to mind was you Second thing was how do I know if it's mine and is it true Third thing was me wishin' that I never did what I did How I ain't ready for no kidding Bye bye to our relationship What was the song released? When?
