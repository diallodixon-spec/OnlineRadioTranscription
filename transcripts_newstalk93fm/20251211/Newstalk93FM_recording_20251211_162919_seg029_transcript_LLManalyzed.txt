2025-12-12 10:13:10 I'll be better on my own, nah, nah Nobody should call my phone, nah, nah This is my last heartbreak song, nah, nah I'll be good on my own Why are you so quick to leave When we both can make it worse When I'm gone, I'll make you nervous If you hurt me, I deserve it I've been acting foolishly Forgetting what you are You start start loving me i know this but even chaos serves a purpose it feels good to love somebody and somebody loves you back so don't give in to your dreams boy cause i'll be here for life
