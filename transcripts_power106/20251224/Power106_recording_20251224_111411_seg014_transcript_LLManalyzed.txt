20251224 111411 Somebody is just messaging me to say, watch what I'm going to say. Come now, the bank has to make a bad mine. Bad mine, of course. Of course. Ma'am said, actually, I'm leaving bad mine. Same way, sir, the ma'am said. All time socialist, that's why. Ah, dear. I think that means it. And I, you know, when I talk to politicians one-a-way, government ministers and so on, they don't have the same response. A lot of it is for sure. And led by the PM who like to say that. But when I talk to different, they don't have that perspective. And you say, well, we're Chinese, whatever. It's a more sensible and positive response than this, this playing to the gallery.
