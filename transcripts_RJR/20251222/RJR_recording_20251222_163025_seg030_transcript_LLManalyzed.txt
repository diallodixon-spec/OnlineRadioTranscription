20251222 163025 Good afternoon, I'm Garfield Jones with your Sports Blitz. Now West Indies Test Captain Rostan Chase says that the run chase was always going to be difficult for the West Indies, as the Caribbean main suffered a 323 run defeat to New Zealand, losing the series 2-0. The result lifts New Zealand to second on the World Test Championship table, while the West Indies are left searching for answers after another costly batting failure. The Abu Dhabi Knight riders, captained by West Indian Jason Holder suffered a four-wicket loss to the Sharjah Warriors in the ILT-20 League on Monday. The Knight Riders made 134 for nine with West Indian all-rounder Shurfane Rutherford top-scoring with 44. The Warriors then got to 134.
