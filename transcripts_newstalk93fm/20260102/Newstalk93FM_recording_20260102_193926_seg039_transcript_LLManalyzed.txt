20260102 193926 I'll be letting you know I want to be dancing with you forever You see through the storm and take me as I am Maybe it's magic any time that we're together I make I just love you and hold you for my hand Hold you for my hand, oh yeah, oh yeah Hold you for me, hold you for me Over and over again, my love is burning, babe Feels like time is frozen and the night is for us We're alone again, every moment's golden, yeah Feelings I've been holding in
