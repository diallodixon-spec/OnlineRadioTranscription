20251222 181608 Baby when I met you there was peace unknown I set out to get you with a fine-tooth comb I was soft inside There was something going on You do something to me that I can't explain Hold me closer and I feel no pain Every beat of my heart We got something going on Tender love is fine It requires a dedication All this love we feel Needs no conversation We're lying together We are now on the mix with Alley Patch. Alley Patch.
