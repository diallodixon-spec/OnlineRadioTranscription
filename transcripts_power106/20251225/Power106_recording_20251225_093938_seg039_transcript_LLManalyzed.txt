20251225 093938 I see your smiling face like I've never seen before Even though I love you madly, it seems I love you more And the little thoughts you give touch my heart for sure Oh, all these things and more That's what Christmas means to me, my love. Oh, yeah. I feel like running wild. I feel just like a little child bringing me the mistletoe. I kiss you once and then some more. I wish you a Merry Christmas, baby. And such happiness in the coming year. Let's deck the halls with holly, singing Silent Night.
