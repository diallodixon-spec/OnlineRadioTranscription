20251219 150706 I'm already, but sometimes I have to keep back some facility with the Skellion. I'm in farming at St Ann's? Yeah, we farm on the house. Okay, so you really are in rebuilding mode, both the farm and you're doing some work on the house? Yes, yes. So this has come at a good time for you. At this time of year, you're able to come in and earn a little extra from this activity here today? Yes, ma'am. All right, fantastic. And outside of that, how can people get in touch with you? My number is 427-6137. All right. Thank you so very much, Ms. Maxine. And I hope you'll set off everything today. So we're encouraging people to come on down. 32 Lindhurst
