2025-12-12 05:33:15 I don't have to go out tonight. I don't have guess who I'll see. I haven't been lonely since the first time we met. I know I'll never be cuz I really care about you you really care about me and there lies the difference Between now and when I was free This time love won't go away The future's so easy
