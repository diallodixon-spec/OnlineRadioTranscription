20251223 171005 investigations following the seizure of mercury smuggled into the country from neighboring Suriname. The interception was made on Sunday at Crabwood Creek in Burbese. CANU reported that the highly toxic substance was found in a car where several parcels were discovered during a search. The mercury has an estimated street value of $18 million. Authorities say the substance is strictly controlled as Guyana works to eliminate its use in gold processing due to its harmful impact on the environment and food chain. The seized mercury has been handed over to the Ministry of Natural Resources for specialized processing and disposal. That's it for regional news. We now move on to international news.
