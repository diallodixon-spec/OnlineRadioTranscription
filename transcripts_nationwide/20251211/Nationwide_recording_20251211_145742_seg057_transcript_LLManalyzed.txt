Hey, shut down cause you know shit, shit means everything and you're not gonna catch none of them planes. Hey, shut down the eyes of the one who comes for the people and you shoot, man, and pressure them case. Hey, shut it down cause you know, shit means everything, and you're not going to catch none of the planes. You think you know the rules and you know that they not like it. See them all eyes pop out that still not like it. But we a shut down the truth and love it in the eye. Big rhythm back in the day, 1997 to be exact. This show time rhythm. If you're an artist and you can't vibe on a rhythm, mm-mm, something wrong, you're not doing it right. It was a pleasure being here, it was a pleasure from one till now. Big up everybody for checking in with me.
