And then in the end it went on to three months and then in the end they just told me to apply for the role and yeah, I know that he did feel away and imagine my first day on the job I had to suspend him. Listen, I could tell you some stories, but anyway, yeah, he did start to act a bit funny but I just, you know, had a conversation with him and said, listen listen You know, I've got to do my job and it's gonna be me or you and it ain't gonna be me So I you know, I have to do what I've gotta do and he was respectful and understood and that but I had to have a conversation with him so Jodie What's your advice to this person? Should she confront the person? Should she just report the issue to higher management or should she just focus on her job and stay quiet? I'm in the era of focusing on job and staying quiet. Jodie, you're in the era of just being quiet. Okay, that's a space you're in right now.
