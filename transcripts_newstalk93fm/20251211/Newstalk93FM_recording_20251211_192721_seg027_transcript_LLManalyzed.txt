Is it a crime? I'm too shocked to hear What am I supposed to do? your body's calling Loving that type of you And I tried to play with something so special Thought that I'd be a fool I'm in the middle of a party But all I'm thinking about is you. 100 million shorties, but you make it easy to choose. How many men wish they could wake up right next to you? Oh, baby, bring it closer. I know just what to do. You're the baddest in the room.
