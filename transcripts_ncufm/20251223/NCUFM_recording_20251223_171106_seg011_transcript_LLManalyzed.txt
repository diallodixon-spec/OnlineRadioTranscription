20251223 171106 as the system rapidly drains. The burst pipe, located in Woodland north of the town, was discovered this morning and repair crews are racing to restore service before the holiday. Emergency bottled water deliveries have already begun for vulnerable residents and customers are being urged to use water sparingly and avoid stockpiling, which the company says could worsen the situation. Local Labour MP Helena Dollimore expressed frustration, saying Hastings is once again affected by aging infrastructure.

Southern Water says the measures are precautionary and assures residents teams are working urgently to complete repairs and limit disruption as quickly as possible. And that's it for the news. I'm Jony Lee Forsyth. The weather is next.
