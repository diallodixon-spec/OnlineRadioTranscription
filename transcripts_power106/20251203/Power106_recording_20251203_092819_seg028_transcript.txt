Michael Manley during the 1970s. Norman Manley GDP was originally projected at $3.29 trillion during the last fiscal year and the finance minister at the time, 19 o'clock, was supposed to tell the world how he planned to finance it in March of last year but he never did so until October 8 after pre-selling some 12 years receivables from the Norman Manley International Airport for $75.5 billion and then jumped ship for the International Monetary Fund. That entity has now been placed on a ratings watch negative by about Fitch and Moody's. The government is also projected to spend 1.26 billion in its fiscal year, 126 billion less than the revised 1.3 trillion dollars, and that was upgraded yesterday by 29 billion dollars, so it's now 1.5 trillion dollars. And the plan is to finance it, 949.49 billion in tax revenues,139.82 billion in non-tax revenues, $4.9 billion in capital revenues, $5.96 billion in grants and the original borrowing requirement of $158.44 billion has now been upgraded because we are borrowing some $3.6 billion.
