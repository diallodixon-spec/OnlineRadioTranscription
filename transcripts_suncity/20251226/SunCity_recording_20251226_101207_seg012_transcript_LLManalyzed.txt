20251226 101207 Hey, my youth, you take it to zero. Me a little piece, just a little. Now you take a sit up on me, I eat up. Give me space, give me room, give me a little breeze now. Jesus, how I make you feel, sir? Through me keep it tight, and me ever clean, sir. Want me, they don't want ya, me never need ya. This enough if people know, keep it on a dealer. Me too young, feel like done with nobody. I pray one day somebody keep her company And a girl like me just wanna have fun and more money But you are pre-relationship and that's a no for me You coulda get in on my feelings You coulda get me if you said you don't
