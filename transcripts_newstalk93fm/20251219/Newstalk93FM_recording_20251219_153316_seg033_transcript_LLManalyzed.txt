20251219 153316 We are now at the end of our drive. Thank you for joining us on this drive. We hope you catch up my night? I'm cute but with arrows babe, I'm just shooting my shot If I could get in, drop me a pen Hop in the pool and come over Don't wanna be friends, just in the skin I wanna get closer and closer and closer The way you got me all in my head I think I matter to you in my bed Whatever it is, you know I can take it Counting the days, how many days till I can see you
