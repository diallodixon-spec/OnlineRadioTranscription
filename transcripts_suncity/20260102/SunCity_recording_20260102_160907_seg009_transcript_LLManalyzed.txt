I say you them people, they'll jump to me thing. I'll say I'll read on a gauze on them thing. They demand them to listen to some of my music. And I say, what do I do when them all listen to the music? I say, so music can carry you to some places where you never been before. You never dream of going before. So, you don't know. We just keep on putting out some music because the world is big. So if your music is not going to a good certain place, it may be going to a certain place where you don't even know about. It's a joy, my bro. Music can travel, man. Yeah, music can travel, it's got wings. It's got wings.
