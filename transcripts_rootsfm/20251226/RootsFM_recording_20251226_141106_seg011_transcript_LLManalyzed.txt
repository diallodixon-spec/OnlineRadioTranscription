20251226 141106 I don't wanna wait in vain for your love From the very first time I bless my eyes on you girl my heart says why don't you know but I know now that I'm way down on the night but the waiting's feeling fine so don't treat me like a puppet on the street Cause I know I can do my thing Don't talk to me if you think I'm dumb
