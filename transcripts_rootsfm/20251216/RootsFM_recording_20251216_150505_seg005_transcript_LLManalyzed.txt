20251216 150505 Well, actually, the day before is my friend Love Divine's birthday, so we're going to be celebrating. I have a few things, you know, in mind that I want to do with her, but we're probably just going to party, to be honest. So where the party will be held? There's one party that we're trying to get tickets to, a Renaissance party. I don't know where exactly it's keeping, but it's going to be here in Kingston. And I was thinking to, you know, maybe give her a surprise, get her kids involved. Yes, yes. But I'm assuming that you will be preparing a meal first yeah come on string of Christmas I don't know let me know what's happening yeah yeah cook some food yes I don't know what I'm gonna cook yet because she doesn't eat meat so she does not eat meat no I'll probably cook
