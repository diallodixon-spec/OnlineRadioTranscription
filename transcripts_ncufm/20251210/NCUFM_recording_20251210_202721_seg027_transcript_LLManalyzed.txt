============================================================

I can only imagine I can only imagine When that day comes and I find myself standing in the sun I can only imagine when all I would do Is forever Forever worship you I can only imagine, yeah I can only imagine Surrounded by your glory One with my my heart for you. Will I dance for you, Jesus, or in awe of you be still? Will I stand in your presence, or to my knees will I fall? Will I sing?
