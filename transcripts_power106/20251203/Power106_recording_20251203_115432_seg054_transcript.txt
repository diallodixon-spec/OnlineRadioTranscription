We are the president of the private sector organization of Jamaica. In the meantime, before we get up to news, let me read some of your WhatsApp messages that have come in. Simon, so the money to loan JPS will no longer be coming from the consolidated fund, but the IRI. Is that the case? That is my understanding. Colin says, Simon, remember the PM said yesterday, 20 to 30 years ago, we couldn't go to the high five. That is not true. The only time we couldn't get to the high five is under the JLP administration of Bruce Boulding. Asked him how much is in the last budget for foreign direct investment. It was down significantly, by the way. Simon, the minister said that Jamaica's GDP is 20 billion U.S. dollars. That is what she told the PM. Simon, I see you being devil's advocate here. It couldn't be anything else.
