20260102 154419 I'm sad inside, but I know it's for the best ride. You had to realize where you drew the line. I will cross the line a thousand times. You got what I need, babe. I need you in a spotlight. Alone lines of social suicide I refuse to die, not by your side So I'll take what I get from you, then I'll hide And set the lucid dreams for another time I still hate it when you're not there I know I should, I know I should But no, I don't care I still hate it when you're not there
