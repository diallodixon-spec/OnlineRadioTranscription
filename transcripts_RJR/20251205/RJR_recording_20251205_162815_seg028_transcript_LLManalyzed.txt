If you want me to go, go You can't be looking the way you do You can't be walking the way you do Because you're looking me You done hooked me already Could it be your cute pretty face Could it be the oil in your face Made me feel like a heart to chase You hooked me already Girl, you smart, you know how to spend Where you take care of the children This should never end But if if you want me to go You gotta be looking somewhere I feel it in my soul One chance is everything we've waited for It's our time, so let we take it all Knock it out and it's won Sean Paul and Ken.
