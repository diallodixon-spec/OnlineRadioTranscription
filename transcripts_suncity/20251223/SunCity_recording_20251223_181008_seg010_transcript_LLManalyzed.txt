Listen to what's going on, man. You don't want to live, you don't want to enjoy life. You don't wanna achieve things in life. Listen to my man, listen to when positive people are telling you good things or giving you advice. People who have been through the rough and made it. Successful people, listen to them man. You're gonna follow bad company. You see what happened to them and you still follow them? No man, you're not smart man. You're not smart at all. Alright, so that's going to be giving you some reggae music in this segment.
