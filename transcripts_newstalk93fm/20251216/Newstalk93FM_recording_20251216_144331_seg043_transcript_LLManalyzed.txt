20251216 144331 The eldest daughter Of a nobleman Ophelia lived in fantasy The love was a cold bed Full of scorpions The venom stole her sanity And if you'd never call for me I might have lingered in purgatory You wrap around me like a cha-cha A crowd of fire Pulling me into the fire All that time I sat alone in my tower You were just haunting your powers, now I can see it all. They won now, you took me out of my grave and saved my heart from the fate of Ophelia. I'll keep you 100 on the land, the sea, the sky.
