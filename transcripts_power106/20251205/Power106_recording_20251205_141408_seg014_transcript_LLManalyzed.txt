============================================================

look at the week that was and how we can possibly improve on a good thing to come back even stronger in the following traditional work week next week. Of course we say thank you if you are listening to us by whatever medium whether it be on the FM band 106.1 to 106.9 FM from Morant Point to Negril Point this is power 10 FM, serving Jamaica and the diaspora. Good afternoon to you if you're listening to us on the Power 106 FM app, if you're listening on the One Spot Media app and onespotmedia.com, or whether it be by the Gleaners website, go-jamaica.com, or by the Digicel and Flow Cable Networks here in Jamaica or other internet radio platforms such as Smart Speaker, Google, TuneIn.com, Nobex.com, whatever medium you're choosing to listen to us at this time. In a manner of speaking, manners and respect and thank you once again.
