No filter, just real light. In my eyes, you're perfect in the real life, yeah. Baby, I feel like I struck gold or struck oil, and I realize it. Love is a boomerang, yeah. You get and give it back, yeah. Love how you tag and own me. Love always, you know, but you see. You're my man crush every day. Man crush every day. How I love you away, away, away. Monday to Sunday. Baby, you're my man crush everyday. Man crush everyday.
