I don't need a rich just somebody that can make me feel safe.. I don't worry cuz I'm hard I just ran a little cross the plate safe like we playing tag I got a big dog in a safe like you one of these play my face. Yeah, you know, I know you know that I'm that right You got a girl that a girl that wanna get right When I spaz and I crash, you ain't gon' dip, right? That's when I need you the most That's how I get right Baby, if I'm safe and it runs, I can say Safe Safe like the money, let it sit up in the bank Safe Safe like a cold with the alarm, I can say My body got right by my side
