Cross my heart, you know I be kind I got the right away If my heart break, you gon' have to pay Please stay focused No, focus, focus I believe in us That don't mean that I'm blind That don't mean I lost my mind I can do right by you I'm kind of messed up too Let me love you in your darkest days When everybody disappear, no trace You say you demon them plenty The darkness just means her empty soul Love me up when you're feeling fine I'll be there in the evening time Love me now it's got you on my mind Mass my heart you know I'll be kind Tell me are you willing? Take all this love that I'm giving What's life? Feel like you're living? Make a wrong move I'm forgiving baby
