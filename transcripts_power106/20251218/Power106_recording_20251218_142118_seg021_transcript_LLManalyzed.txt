20251218 142118 A beautiful marriage. Beautiful marriage. We're going to walk around a little bit more. Let us head over to another one of our vendors. Sweet pepper. I also see beetroot. Well, beet is one of my favorite foods. I like to use it in a beverage. I grew up in a home where my grandmother used two pounds of carrots with one beetroot. And that was used to make a drink. Some of us may want to boil the beet. I don't think there's any need to. But you blend them both and you get a refreshing, a satisfying, and a very nutritious beverage. You have cabbage over there, stir fry, salt fish, corned beef, sardine, whatever the protein of your choice. So we can have the vegetables there, the cabbage and the carrots cooked or in uncooked meals.
