20251224 155128 I want for Christmas is you. I don't want a lot for Christmas. There is just one thing I need. And I don the present Underneath the Christmas tree I don't need to make my stocking Live upon the fireplace Santa Claus won't make me happy With a toy on Christmas day I just want you for my own. More than you could ever know. Make my wish come true. All I want for Christmas is you. You, baby.
