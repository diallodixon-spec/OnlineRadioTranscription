If I love me, I can love you more. If you love you, you can love me more. We can love each other, build, and make it a better space and place. Let's do this. Let's take care of the elders. Mamagata, bless up my darling. We continue to take care of the future generation, you know? Yeah, man, let's look after them, right? And hey, a new moon is coming! Hashtag save soil. Hashtag save self, hashtag save soil. Mama Earth! You know we love you, right? We got to protect you and take care of you. Oh, yeah. That's right. Alright, I'll pull up that. I want to pull up that.
