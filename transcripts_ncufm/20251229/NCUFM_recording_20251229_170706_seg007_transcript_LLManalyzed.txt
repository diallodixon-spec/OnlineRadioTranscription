20251229 170706 And continuing in the news, more than 200 farmers and fisherfolk in Treasure Beach, St. Elizabeth have received over $7 million in supplies and equipment as part of recovery efforts following Hurricane Melissa. The assistance distributed last week at the Breds Foundation Complex through a partnership between the NCB Foundation and the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries included $50,000 vouchers for farmers and fishing gear for fishers to help restore livelihoods. Portfolio Minister Floyd Green says the initiative forms part of the Coordinated National Recovery Program with additional island-wide support underway, including fishing wire distribution, grants for damaged boats and engines, and a six-month waiver on fishing license renewal fees in the affected parishes. The NCB Foundation, which has invested more than $500 million in recovery, says the initiative falls under its Building a Better Jamaica fund, with a focus on safeguarding agriculture and food security.
