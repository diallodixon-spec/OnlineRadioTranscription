20251215 163928 Thank you for that. Quite quite insightful there. Let's see what the JPS chooses to do. Let's see, what they choose to do in terms of training. Possibly speaking with the government as to how we can even make this recovery even better than it is going forward for future disaster management. Thank you for your message. Errol is online. Errol, are you there? Good afternoon. How are you, Jesse? I am very well this afternoon, how are you? Glad to hear from you. Right, glad to speak with you as well, Errol. Yeah, I have to talk with you before Christmas come and go now. I want you to make a party and invite all your colleagues and make some money for the needy.
