20251226 143021 You're praying. Look in the mirror. Always remember. Come on! I almost gave up. But the Holy Ghost powered y'all. Came down from heaven. Hardships. Difficulties. Tears, scars, this is what I do. I smile. Even though I hurt, see I smile. But that feels good. I know God is working, so I smile. All things are working. Even though I've been here for a while. Still, I smile. Smile. Hallelujah. It's so hard to look up when you've been down. I know it's hard right now. Show but hate to see you give up now. Because you're a winner. You look so much better when you smile. You look better. Dallas. New Orleans. Come on.
