Just me, myself and her and my shadow I'm gonna live in her life, I'm gonna get over her, yeah I'm gonna live my life, when I get over her, what else? Well, I don't know how I'm gonna survive the hard trip I'm in trip in here Life never sweet like a chocolate vanilla Train line my bond, I'm not bound I don't feel a little monkey Watch how you a talk to gorilla cause Check out the men, buy a **** with the **** Two party a flex like a party them in Accepting presents from foreign government We still a fool them and a school them and cocky them in Good God the f**k mouses and rat in the killer Poor people fed up on wiki and sim sim Getting all the survivors a b**ch Sing much less a baller Who is a b**ch the winner Have a right foot like a David V The mother still a s**t
