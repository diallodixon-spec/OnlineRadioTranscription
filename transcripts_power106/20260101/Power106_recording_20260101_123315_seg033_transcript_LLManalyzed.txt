20260101 123315 Long lonely nights I'm reaching for you Are you feeling it too? Does the feeling seem oh so right? And what would you say If I called on you now? Said that I can't hold on There's no easy way It gets harder each day Please love me or I'll be gone, I'll be gone I'm all out of love, I'm so lost without you I know you were right, believing for so long I'm out of love, what am I without you? I can't be too late to say that I was so wrong Oh, what do you think about?
