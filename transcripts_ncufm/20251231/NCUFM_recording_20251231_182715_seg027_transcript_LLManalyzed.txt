20251231 182715 ways for this evening. I had fun in today's show. Maxine says she have work tomorrow. A lot of presses will be off tomorrow. Yes, they really. Blessings to you. Charmin Edwards, blessings to you. All the best for 2026. Thank you, Nomi. Thank you, Auntie Sharon. As we get on out of here, I want to remind you that true joy is not found in circumstances or in seasons, but in resting confidently in God's presence. When we release our worries into his hands, not by our will, but his, and trust him with what lies ahead, our hearts are filled with a peace that lasts beyond today, a peace that passeth all understanding. Isaiah 26 verse 3 reminds us, thou wilt keep him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on thee, because he trusteth in thee.
