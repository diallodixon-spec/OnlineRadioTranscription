20251231 161813 There will come a time when you'll find a lot of persons not being responsible end up being in trouble. You're going to see an increase in lawsuits happening because persons just refuse to get the facts. A case in point, earlier this year there was a police officer, name doesn't come to mind immediately right now, but he was killed in the whole labor space. And then immediately everybody started to talk about, start to call two individuals named who are allegedly linked to the criminal underworld. And they were saying that, you know, these were the two men who killed the police officers. There was no evidence. Took up the phone, called one of the lead, I called the lead investigator and I called another investigator attached to the case. They said, Mr. Hansel, we have no evidence linking the men.
