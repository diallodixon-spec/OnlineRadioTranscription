2025-12-12 10:29:59 Radio Jamaica 94 FM every last Thursday at 1220 PM. Brought to you by Bank of Jamaica. This is your Radio Jamaica. We all felt the forceful winds and rains, but for some, they brought unimaginable loss, homes destroyed, lives disrupted, and communities cut off from each other. For decades, the RGR Gleaner Communications Group has answered the call in times of crisis. Through the RG Cares Foundation, that spirit of compassion continues. We invite you to stand with us and support our brothers and sisters in need. Please donate bottled water, canned foods, other non-perishable items and personal hygiene products. Items can be dropped off at our partner churches, Webster United, Hope United,
