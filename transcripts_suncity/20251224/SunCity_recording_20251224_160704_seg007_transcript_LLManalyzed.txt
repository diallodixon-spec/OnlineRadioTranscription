20251224 160704 I find music by love Right here in my heart, you'll always sustain In separatism You are the sunshine of my life. So much excitement when you are around. There's so much about you that words can't say. Makes me want to love you in a special way. Honey, you gave new meaning to my life. You'll forever be here with me, in separate worlds.
