20251219 115747 here except the date when I was appointed in the service, right? Ministry of the Public Service, Services Commission, Accountant General, nobody have that paper, that piece of document, that one document that stated I was appointed in this service, December 12, 2020, or whatever. Every other document and my personal file is here because I start out in the registry as a filing clerk and I know my personal file number. Everything is in that file from the time I start until when I was fully appointed in the service. Okay, I have been told by one of our viewers that it's the accountant general department for government pension that perhaps, have you spoken to anyone at the accountant general department? Yeah, yeah, we did. We did everything, everything, everything.
