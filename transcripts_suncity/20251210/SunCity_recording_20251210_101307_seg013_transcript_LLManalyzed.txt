Yeah, that's basically that wonderful. So you spoke earlier, you know, hopefully the song well I'm not saying hopefully definitely the song will be in a Christmas movie What scene do you see this song be in? You know played like what's a perfect scene for a song like this to be played at? Of course that scene Where you know? Two couples who gave up on love came back together somewhere or the other. They ran into each other somewhere out there in the world and everything that was once dead has no respite. You know, the song starts playing. They're in each other's, you know, arms and they're headlocked and they are just, you know, happy again to be in each other's company type of vibe. Yes. But yeah, that song, this song would be perfect for a Christmas movie. Trust me.
