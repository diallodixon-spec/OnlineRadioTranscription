============================================================

Your generosity knows no bounds. Five gold rings. When the parcel arrived, I was scared stiff that it might be more birds, because the smell in the living room is atrocious. However, I don't want to seem ungrateful for the beautiful rings, your affectionate friend, Gov'net. Day six. Nula, what are you trying to do to us? It isn't that we don't appreciate your generosity, but the six geese have not alone nearly murdered the callin' birds, but they laid their eggs on top of the vet's head from the pear tree, and his bill was sixty-eight pound in cash. My mother is munching sixty grains of valium a day and talking to herself in a most alarming way. You must keep your feelings for me in check, gobbner. Day seven. Nola, we are not amused by your little joke. Seven swans a-swimming is a most romantic idea, but not in the bath of a private house. We cannot use the bathroom now because they have gone completely savage and rush the door every time we try to enter.
