20251215 150707 Christmas time again So alive again You can share with someone from the little you Let nothing spoil the mood Ain't got much but we're feeling good God has been so faithful Let we go It's been a long year We made it through, we belong here about. Good times with family and friends. And I want to thank the Two Life Family, Kenneth, for always, always just being here with us and paying keen attention to the show. We have a listener, Bro G says hey Johnny I'm here at work feeling down as today December 15 marks 10 years since my dad passed away. However I can remember every time he was about to tell us a joke he would laugh out the joke
