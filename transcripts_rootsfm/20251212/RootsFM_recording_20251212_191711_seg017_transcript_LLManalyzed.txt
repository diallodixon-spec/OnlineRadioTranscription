20251212 191711 I'll never do more. I'll love you, love you. Love to party. Oh, oh, oh, oh. Yeah, hear me, greater, it's the nights of Easter session. The lyrics of me, man, must always have a word of caution. Because the right one way we have to teach is younger generations. That loving is a thing. You can't get too much. Breaking music is a thing. You can get too much. Jam music is a thing, you can get too much, too much. Oh, too much. La dee la dee. We love to party. Oh, we love to party.
