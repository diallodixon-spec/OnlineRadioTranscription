20251217 181817 It is with profound pleasure and honor that I bring greetings on behalf of the newly established Ministry of Water, Environment and Climate Change at this public lecture under the theme, From Loss to Financing, Climate Resilience for Vulnerable States in a Post-Disaster World. This theme could not be more relevant and urgent and timely for Jamaica and the Caribbean in particular, and the wider small island developing states worldwide in general. Today, we gather at a crucial juncture in our shared journey towards a sustainable future. Climate change is no longer a distant threat. It is a reality that manifests in devastating floods, hurricanes and rising sea levels. These events not only threaten lives and livelihoods, but also impose immense economic costs, losses that are often overwhelming.
