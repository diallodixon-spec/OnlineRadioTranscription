Maybe Mr Morgan has more time on his hand than, for example, say, Abga and the Minister of Information herself. So he, you know, continue because Marlon continued to do the heavy political lifting there, you know. I mean, so, you know, he has been promoted and so on, but he has not given up that heavy role of the political aspect of things. So he's going to push hard, but I want him to do it with a more to come of decency. That's all I ask. He's embarrassing himself in the course of doing it. I don't know why a young man takes so much licks and embarrassment on himself.
