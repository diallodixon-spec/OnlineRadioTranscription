2025-12-12 12:44:35 Caribbean. This afternoon expect partly cloudy skies over western parishes and hilly areas. Otherwise it should be sunny. Tonight should be fair. 31 degrees Celsius is the maximum temperature expected for Kingston today. While in Mantiga Bay the maximum temperature expected is 30 degrees Celsius. And for the next three days look for sunny skies in the morning except for partly cloudy skies over eastern parishes. In the afternoons look for isolated showers over western parishes and hilly areas elsewhere. I'll see you in the next one.
