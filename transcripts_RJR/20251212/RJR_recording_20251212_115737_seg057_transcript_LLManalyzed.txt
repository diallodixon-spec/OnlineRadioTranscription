2025-12-12 12:41:08 and we gave and gave our things. And so you'll see us going even next week, we're going out to Saplamare, we're going also to Westmoreland, we're also going up into St. Elizabeth, in the hills of St. Elizabeth. So we are doing a lot of those and helping to support our Jamaicans who are going through a very difficult time. Looks like I need to call you right after this, from my initiative into Deep Rural Westmoreland, so we'll talk. We're out of time, but thank you so much for the heart at NCB and NCB Foundation as well. All right. Thank you so much. He's head of group marketing and communications, Casey of Vaughan. And that's all about NCB. Grant a wish. Market at the lawn. Customer relief program. Build a better Jamaica fund. Meditation and news time now.
