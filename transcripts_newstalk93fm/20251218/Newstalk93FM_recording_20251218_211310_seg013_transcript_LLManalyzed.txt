20251218 211310 I have a lightning spirit Early in the morning I had it Me cooler ready, me ice done ready Me punching that's automatic I have a lightning jumbie A kind of energy inside me And it ready for the rum Ready, ready for the rum, ready, ready, for the rum Ready for the action A spiritual encounter Killing the soul, taking over Telling me to start up the drinking And do away with good behaviour So we out on the road now It's Mars and Riddy Man Soaker And I'm ready for the rum, ready for the action, come! This sweating spirit has me feeling good!
