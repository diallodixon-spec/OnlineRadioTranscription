See the end was near But look at us now Look what we found We're soaring high Way up the ground You gave me wings Now I can fly Bursting through the clouds We're shooting high Like a star across the sky like the star across the sky when you thought i would walk away when we heard all the things they said When we thought there was no other way I promised we would make it through it I'm so glad that I stayed And girl I thank heaven never changed
