20251231 183729 I'm very pleased where the office is now in terms of the transformation and that is what I focus on and I hope that the public of Jamaica first of all let me thank the public of Jamaica for all their support and all the prayers I have felt them and it has been a privilege to use whatever talent that God has given me as a communicator and as somebody who is regarded as having courage to work in the public interest. It has been a privilege. And if I had my life to live again, I tweeted just the other night that I'm going to really miss you as DPP. I think you did a lot to educate the Jamaican people. You did a lot to cause me, before I even knew you or interviewed you, to be passionate about law and wanting to study law.
