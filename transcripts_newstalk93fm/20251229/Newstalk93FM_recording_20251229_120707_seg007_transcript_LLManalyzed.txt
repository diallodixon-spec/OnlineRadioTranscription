20251229 120707 because I do one way. They don't want me in their posh city. I don't listen to nothing they say. Every fast I jump, jumping up, doing what I want. Jumping up. Tell them I ain't leaving, right, they are sleeping. Every fast I drop, jumping up. Doing what I want, jumping up. Tell them, I ain't leaving. Right, they're sleeping. Hey, they don't want me, don't want me. Don't want me, they don't want me. Until my head gone and I'm miserable. All the money grown, I'm causing trouble. Look how deep security I watch me. They don't know I'm out there. I just mush up the place and I be fret like a chumbe. I don't wait. They don't want me in their party, they don't want me because I do. One way. One way. I don't listen to nothing they say.
