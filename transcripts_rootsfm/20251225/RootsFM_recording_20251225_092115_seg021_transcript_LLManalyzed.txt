20251225 092115 this christmas night and every christmas i'll be there this time of year we're both away we gotta fall in love again at christmas time and all the angels in the sky shine down on us as we roll by they gotta fall in love with the feeling. Fall in love, fall in love, trust believe we can fall in love. But in the Christmas time, I'll be singing again. Father love, Father love, taste the season. Don't forget there's a reason we gotta fall in love.
