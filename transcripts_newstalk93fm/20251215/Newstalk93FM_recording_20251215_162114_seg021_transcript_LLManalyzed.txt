20251215 162114 I might be falling, I might be falling Make me sweat, make me harder Make me lose my breath Make me water Normally I can keep my cool But tonight I'm whining I'm a bee In a dangerous mood Can you match my timing? Telling me That you're really about it, why'd you hide it? Talk is cheap, so show me that you understand, I like it Can you blow my mind?
