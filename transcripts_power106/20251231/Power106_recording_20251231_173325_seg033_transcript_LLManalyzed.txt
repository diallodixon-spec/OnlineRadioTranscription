20251231 173325 Give me a break baby Need to be with you The doctor's on it I feel a shiver I'm feeling down and out I'm a true believer I know what it's all about I know it's not the flu It's all because of you I feel a trembling when I wake Come back and give another break I feel a shiver Running up my spine This hurting, hurting feeling It hits me all the time Every time you go away Seems I can't live another day Oh, my bed, it is so cold, you've got my happiness on hold Oh, I feel a ton of joy, and my heart gets warm Thinking about you, holding you, squeezing you
