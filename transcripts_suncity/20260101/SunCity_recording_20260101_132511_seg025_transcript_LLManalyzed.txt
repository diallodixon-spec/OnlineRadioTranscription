20260101 132511 Keep downin' drinks like there's no tomorrow that's just right now, now, now Now, now, now Don't set the roof on fire, gonna burn this mother floor Down, down, down Hands up When the music drops, we both put our hands up Put your hands on my body Swear I've seen you before I think I remember those eyes, eyes, eyes Baby tonight, I did it again It's falling in love again, again So dance, dance like it's the last, last night of your life, life won't get you right Cause baby tonight I did it again
