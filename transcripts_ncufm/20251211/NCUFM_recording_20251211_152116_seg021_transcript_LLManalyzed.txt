============================================================

All his blessings on me And the mercies he's bestowed I'm drinking from my saucer Cause my cup has overflowed You know right now, you may be going through some rough times in your life, but I'm here to encourage you today not to give up. I pronounce a blessing upon your life, upon your family. You must cross one being good health in the name of Jesus. I believe it on my heart. So Lord help me not to grumble and complain.
