20260102 132613 I don't want to do no harm, say no to my intentions Father got me a biggest heartless man, without an empty heart Feel like we are dead Can't manage A time for your bliss, man Take me off of your strength and soldieress I know you're strong and soldieress But if we give up We need that one cent of moon knowledge So myself I get to allow And my life can't shut out yet The more the time starts over I'm like, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah.
