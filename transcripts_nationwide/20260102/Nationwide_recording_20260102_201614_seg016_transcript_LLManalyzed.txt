20260102 201614 is important because you see, one of the things that students would realize that, you know, apart from doing these subjects, what you find then is that we're teaching them about life principles and development. And these are the things and the tools that they need so that when they finish school, they're able to know how to, from their English class, how to write letters, which is important, write the application, as he said, and also the resume writing, and then doing that now through an information technology approach. Thank you for laying that. So it's cross-curriculum teaching thereabouts. And it's not only about resume writing, but it's more than that um some aspect of it is also within the edpm syllabus and um to be honest teaching it from grade 7 want them to be exposed but teaching it from grade seven can be a little bit boring you know you learn the same thing
