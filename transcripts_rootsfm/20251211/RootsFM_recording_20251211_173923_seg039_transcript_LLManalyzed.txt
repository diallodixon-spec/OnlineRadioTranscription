2025-12-12 02:11:50 I wanna run back to your arms again There's no one in the world Loves me like you do Please take me back baby, I can't go on I'm unhappy, I'm on fire for my truth I'll do whatever it takes, I've got to get you back and win again I realize, I need your hand in my life. No one, no one, no one loves me like you. Much, much, much more.
