20260102 130706 Crazy. I almost got killed one morning. I was right there on the police station at Carle Garden police station. Luckily, I looked. Next guy came to the red light, brilliantly at fast speed, very high speed. So the red light camera is the next one too that I think critically talking about. This red light camera, it will give you a ticket if you go through the light. I think that we're very willing to make a discussion on these intersections, on these highways. They give you a ticket. If you go through the lights, a lot of people don't know. When I say yellow, what does that mean, Simon? Let me see if you're good at driving. It means... What is Indian yellow? What is it supposed to do? Slow down. No. When it's Indian yellow, if you're in the intersection, then you go.
