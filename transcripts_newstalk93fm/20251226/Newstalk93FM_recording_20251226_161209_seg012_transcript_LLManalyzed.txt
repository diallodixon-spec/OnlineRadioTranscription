20251226 161209 I have a lightning spirit Early in the morning I hat it Me cooler ready Me heist done ready Me punching that's automatic Ready, ready, for the rum Ready for the action A spiritual encounter Killing me soul taking over Telling me to start up the drinking Can't do away with good behaviour So we out on the road now Boom. It's Mars and Riddy Man Soaker. And I'm ready for the rum. Ready, ready for the rum, ready, ready for rum, ready for the action. Boom. Whoa, yo, yo, yo. Whoa, yo. Yo, yo. Yo. Yo. Whoa, yo yo. Yo. The sweating spirit of the feeling.
