20260101 184228 I was the queen that I'm meant to be I lived two lives, tried to play both sides But I couldn't find my own place Caught a phallic child, cause I got too wild But now that's how I'm getting paid Cause I see your stage I'm done hiding, now I'm shining like I'm born to be We dreamin' hard, we came so far, now I believe We're going butterfly. Oh, our time, no fears, no lies.
