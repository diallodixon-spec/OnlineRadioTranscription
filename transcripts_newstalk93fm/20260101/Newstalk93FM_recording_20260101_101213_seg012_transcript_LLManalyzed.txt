You say me keep singing. I bet you I'm on the street. You're such a keeper. Turn it up like a speaker. Pull it up and repeat it. As long me know say it's with you. Because any time it cross your mind, you would jump in a vehicle. Drive me in a Mazda Street feature. I'm gonna feel speed of me, baby. I would have never had imagined you and I would be rocking, would be jamming.
