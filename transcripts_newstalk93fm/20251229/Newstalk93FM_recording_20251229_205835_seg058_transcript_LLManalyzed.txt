20251229 205835 Living a life that know it's so sad Nobody no believe in a love again Because every love that lost Nobody no believe, in a friend again Oh me, stop it now, I can't let you wrong Nobody no loyal, and it hurts my heart Still a heart for one and one for all Still I'm strong With love on my mind, love in my thoughts carrying on Why nobody no believe in a love again? Because every love that lost, nobody no believe
