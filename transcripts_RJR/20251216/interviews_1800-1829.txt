Interview Found: Dionne Jackson Miller with Jade Williams from Jamaicans for Justice

Title: Underutilization of the Child Diversion Act in Jamaica

In a recent interview on Radio Jamaica's "Beyond the Headlines" program, Dionne Jackson Miller spoke with Jade Williams, Policy Research and Advocacy Manager at Jamaicans for Justice, about the underutilization of the Child Diversion Act in Jamaica. The Act, which aims to divert children away from the formal justice system and into rehabilitative programs, has been in place for several years but has not been used to its full potential.

According to Williams, the Act has a two-tier process, where the police can refer children to the diversion program for less serious offenses, while the court can consider more serious offenses. However, Williams noted that the majority of referrals are for sexual offenses, particularly sex with a person under the age of 16. She argued that this is not the best use of the diversion program's resources, as these cases often involve consenting teenagers who are in a relationship.

Williams suggested that the resources of the child diversion process would be better served in cases involving more serious offenses, such as major crimes. She also highlighted the absence of early intervention agencies that can refer children to the diversion process, resulting in the underutilization of the program.

The issue of sex under the age of 16 was also discussed, with Williams noting that Jamaicans for Justice is advocating for the decriminalization of consensual sex between teenagers. She pointed out that the current law can lead to unnecessary criminalization of young people, particularly boys, who are often reported to the police by their partner's parents or guardians.

Jackson Miller added that the law does not provide an exception for cases where both parties are under 16 and are in a consensual relationship, leading to a situation where children are taken to court and put through a traumatic process. Williams agreed, highlighting the need to review the offense of grievous sexual assault as it relates to persons under the age of 16, particularly in cases where there is no force or coercion involved.

The interview highlighted the need for a more nuanced approach to the Child Diversion Act, one that takes into account the complexities of adolescent relationships and the need to prioritize rehabilitation over punishment. As Williams noted, the goal of the Act is to divert children away from the formal justice system and into rehabilitative programs, with the aim of reintegrating them into society as contributing members. However, the current implementation of the Act falls short of this goal, and it is essential to address these issues to ensure that the program is used effectively to support the well-being and development of Jamaican children.
