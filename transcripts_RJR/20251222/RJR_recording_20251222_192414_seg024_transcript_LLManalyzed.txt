20251222 192414 very passionate about her work, absolutely. All right, Debbie online in St. Andrew. Debbie, what's on your mind? Hi, Deon. How are you? All the best for the season. And the very same to you. What's up? I just heard a caller talking about what the government has not been doing, and I am in agreement with him. They're making lots of announcements. The announcement sounds good, but the people are going through a whole lot right now. And I thought the government would have set up tents in different areas, even take them to different parts of the island, just to give them some relief, right? I heard that they're going to have to leave the school that they're at in Petersville. Petersville? Is that in West Milan? Petersfield. Petersfield, my dear. But where are they going to go? Because I'm telling you, if these people had a choice, they would not be staying in the shelters.
