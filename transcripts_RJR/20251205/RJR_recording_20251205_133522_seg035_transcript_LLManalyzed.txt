If there's anything you need All you have to do is say Don't you satisfy everything in me You shouldn't waste a single day So don't stop before then It's destiny calling A power i just can't deny it's never changing can't you hear me i'm saying i want you for the rest of my life together forever and ever to pass together forever with you and don't you know I would move heaven and earth To be together forever with you If they ever get you down There's always something I can do
