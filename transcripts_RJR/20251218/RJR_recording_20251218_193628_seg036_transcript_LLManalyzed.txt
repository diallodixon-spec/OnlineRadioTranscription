20251218 193628 As we approach the holiday season, the Jamaica Constabulary Force, JCF, says it will maintain a strong presence in major towns across the country. While there has been an increase in traffic during the holiday period due to improved infrastructure, increased commercial activity and a growing number of vehicles on the road, the holiday season will be different this year because of the impact of Category 5 Hurricane Melissa. Assistant Commissioner of Police ACP assigned to the Strategic Operations portfolio and the Public Safety and Traffic Enforcement branch, Dr. Gary McKenzie, says the storm's impact has further intensified traffic volumes, particularly within the Kingston Metropolitan Region, KMR. What we have also noticed at the end of last month coming into December is that because of Hurricane Melissa, the Kingston Metropolitan Region is now inundated with more vehicles.
