============================================================

I know everybody I go like we still be irate, cause we no love likes. We not dance all night. I know everybody, I go like, still be irate. Cause we no love likes, you know. So every time advice, we do it for the love, we not do it for the light. Do it for the love we not do it with the light. Make them know success don't come overnight. You make them know a substance over hype. Do it for love we not do with the light. And I never see them live now.
