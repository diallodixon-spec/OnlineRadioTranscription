============================================================

I'll be down by the river Singing songs of joy on this lovely day Oh yeah Pre-singing birds told me By sunrise he's always there in the morning Praying and blessing the day I've heard about this little tale long time ago But never had the faith to believe in my soul Now mother nature sent to me three little birds Singing a song, convincing me it was so Now I'm on my way Anyone come to see me this day Tell them I'll be gone all the day I'll be down by the river
