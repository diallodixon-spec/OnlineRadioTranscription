20251226 102729 Like a warrior that fights And wins the battle I know the taste of victory Though I went through some nights Conce by the shadows. I was gripped up emotionally. Somehow I'm related to the body. Once I did it, I escaped. I found a way out. Darkness kept my faith. I believed. Kept my faith. And the river was deep. I didn't know where your darkness kept my faith in me Kept my faith when the river was deep I didn't fall down when the mountain was high I still believed when the valley was low He didn't stop me no more
