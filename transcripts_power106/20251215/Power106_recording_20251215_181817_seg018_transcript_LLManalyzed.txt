20251215 181817 coach. Not my choice, but true to the matter. The JPEG found themselves in a position where he was the ideal candidate to be selected. And I think it's unfortunate for him because he will have no baptism, he'll have no familiarity sessions with the players because even though he was a part in the setup as an advisor, he was not coaching the team. He's not totally familiar with all the players, but I think he has some know-how and he has been watching some of what has been going on. So now he has what you call a very short express program in terms of getting to know the players, getting them in the right positions to suit his style and play the game all within a few days. It's going to be like a week. And after the week that we're going to get for the international break, everything has to be done in that frame of time. And you'll have two games.
