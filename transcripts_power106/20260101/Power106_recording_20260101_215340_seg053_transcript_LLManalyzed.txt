20260101 215340 So you heard that I'm a rebel with a heart made of stone I gotta rest a spirit that nobody can know Every picture tells a story won't you listen to mine? I'm searching for the answer but it's so hard to find You'll see much deeper when you breathe between the lines Cause there's a fire burning in fire I've got beef in the night Who can't get enough? I am willing to fight Cause I'm a soldier of love Like a shot in the dark When the going gets rough Itets the state of the heart You're a soldier of love I'm willing to fight
