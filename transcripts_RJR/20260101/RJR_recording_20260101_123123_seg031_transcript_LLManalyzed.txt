20260101 123123 I will always do the good I can, for a hatred I can't stand. And I hope you feel the same way too, the goodness of the world carry you through Do good unto others and I will do the same for you Be with the child, my friend, and you will prove what I'm saying is true Love is the answer for A-O-R Love is the answer True love of a father If your neighbor would come begging you something Don't say go and come tomorrow, give it now
