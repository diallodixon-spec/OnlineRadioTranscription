20251226 171711 One time, with my friends, where, where? You want to move? Hello, hi, hi, hi. Hello, hi. That's all about you. It never ceases up. Lick, mackerel, and tell me nothing is up. Baby, dance. I tell you how to dance. I don't lie. Check the ground. I just shoot every new dance move. Lick, pat, pat, pat. I tell you it's easy. Shake. We bounce back in the back, dancing straight. Pat, pat. So you know I said, yeah, yeah.
