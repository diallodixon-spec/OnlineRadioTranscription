20251222 123118 They told us they had a choice to either stay employed with UDC or be employed by the new owners. They also mentioned that if any employee decides to seek employment with new operators as a part of the lease agreement, they'd have to pay us the same salary or more, but it can't be less. They did not uphold their end of what they told us. UDC went ahead and redundant all employees without giving us any option to decide if we want to remain with the company. We are now employed under the new operators who have significantly cut our salaries. Employees are left displeased and distressed because none of what they told us was upheld. A point to note, UDC operates Duns River, which is understaffed as well as other entities that could have absorbed employees.
