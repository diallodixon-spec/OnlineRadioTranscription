The hooptie, the rose, the money flowin' Certain doors that we goin' The people we meet, the hands that we shake Whether it's Morton's or Sizzler's steak But everything'll be okay If we do it my way, my way my way Cause I believe in romance Kissin' while you slow dance Me bouncin', baby, no chance No matter the circumstance Whatever it takes, girl, I swim to France Cause your beauty's unmatched Such a great catch Unconditional love, forever we are attached Deal with the trauma, we can find our way back With or without the Maybach, hush baby Baby, I just don't get it Do you enjoy being hurt? I know you smell the perfume The makeup on his shirt
