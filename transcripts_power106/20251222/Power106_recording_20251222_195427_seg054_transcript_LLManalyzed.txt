20251222 195427 has undergone surgery. We can say the 26-year-old Swede successfully underwent surgery on an ankle injury that included a fibular fracture, but no specific timeline has been given for his return. His act is expected to be sidelined for several months. He picked up the injury during Liverpool's match at Spurs on Saturday after coming off the bench to score. He was heard following a chatting from Nicky van de Ven shortly after striking the goal and was forced to leave the field in visible discomfort. Cricket now was seen as a heavy defeat as New Zealand wrapped up the third and final test by 323 runs at Mount Maunganui, sealing a 2-0 series victory. Resuming 143 without loss on the final day and chasing an improbably 462 for victory, the West Indies collapse began after a promising start.
