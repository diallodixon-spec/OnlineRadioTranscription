20251217 141111 We're not feeling under the weather You just make me feel sweet Ice the cocoa tea, use the sugar And together we are complete, darling Said I'm falling, falling, I'm falling As I lay my bed with my head to the ceiling Say I'm drowning alone and I'm lost in my feelings Somebody send me a sign cause you know that I need it
