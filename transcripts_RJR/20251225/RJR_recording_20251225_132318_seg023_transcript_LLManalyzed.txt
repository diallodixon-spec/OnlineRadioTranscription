20251225 132318 You are my Christmas, yes you are I don't need a present or a glowing tree When I've got you right found And ribbons or bells or shiny things You are my gift, my sun to see. I don't need a second to find your place. Cause I did it with a smile on my face. We have each other like the moon and the stars. You are my Christmas.
