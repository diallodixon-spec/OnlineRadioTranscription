20260102 175246 You can't blame me for trying, love Look up there, the stars are all aligned Now don't you think it's time Oh, oh, oh Closer to me I want to feel your breathing Permanently Cause darling, I'm not leaving here Till I get what I've been waiting for That would make this night complete There have got to be home kisses in the moonlight Sugar, fly away with me Most of my days I get so busy with you
