of my friend, one of us, some time ago, and he has a daughter and the mother doesn't want the child to play outside or to be on. And he was like, no, if you don't do that, then the child will not develop. The immune system will not develop. And at every bout of illness, the child will be sick. Every flu, every virus that passes, every bacteria that passes, the child would not have developed that immunity against these conditions. Of course, we are seeing that also. Research has shown that for irritable bowel disease, persons who live in extremely clean areas where they are not exposed to these bacteria to really build that immunity, then they can develop a terrible bowel disease over time. So to my listeners who are out there, if you are just joining us, welcome to another episode of Beyond the Prescription brought to you by Providence Pharmacy, 25 Olympic Wales.
