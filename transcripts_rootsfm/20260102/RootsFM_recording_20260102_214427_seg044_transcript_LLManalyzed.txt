We made the vow on our wedding day From the tip of your tongue I heard you say Now and forever we always stay But from me now you are going away That's why I wanna know, Why are you going away? And why you wanna break my heart? Why are going away? Why wanna break my heart Why? Wanna know why? Tell me why I wanna know why are you going away And why you wanna break my heart Why are you going away
