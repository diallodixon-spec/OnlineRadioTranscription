20251224 092825 Well, again, you know, sometimes our government gets bad things, but I must admit, even in a situation like that, they were very, very helpful and supportive. As a matter of fact, JDF was on standby if we needed to evacuate. Blessed assurance, we were assured that the JDF would use helicopters. But unfortunately, you know, the water receded. All the residents and staff were in the upstairs building. Some of the buildings are two story. But the damage, the damage there is major. Pretty much blessed assurance going to have to be rebuilt. And then also we have to take into account the proximity to our river course there, which is as I just said you've seen the videos I think the water rose to about I don't know seven feet and some parts so we're gonna have to look at what remedial things can be done to ensure this doesn't happen in the future you know with global warming you know everybody
