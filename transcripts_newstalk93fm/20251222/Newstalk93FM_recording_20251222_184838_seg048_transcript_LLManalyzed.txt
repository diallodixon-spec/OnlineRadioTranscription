20251222 184838 Why you know they get my time? Is there someone else? Yeah, they do make on you. Every day new story. Share just a waste my time. Cause you don't become someone else. Zip a lava for me. You know they touch my body. It feels good to love love somebody And somebody loves you back But it feels one sided now It feels one sided now You don't have to return about it Cause it's crystal glad now, now Guess it's bye to the good times I'll be gone by the sunrise I'll be better on my own I'll better on my phone, nobody should call my phone. This is my last heartbreak song.
