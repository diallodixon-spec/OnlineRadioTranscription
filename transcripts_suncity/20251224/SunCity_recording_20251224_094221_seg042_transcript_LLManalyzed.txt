20251224 094221 get rid of religion, method or something. One of the worst evil that was placed on African people is a thing called religion. Don't get me wrong. Our ancestors had a certain African religious belief, which worked perfectly fine because it was in tune with nature, with the cosmos, which is real. You know what I'm saying? But this new version of religion that these people brought to Africa, I'm trying to control my tongue here, brought to Africa and placed it on us and then psychologically enslaved us, psychologically keeping us displaced. And so we're using, you know, religion is separating us and all African people have to do because Mother Nature gave us so much and everything to be a superpower and to promote the philosophy of the African resident. All we have to do is just unite. That's it. Tear down the borders. These are free. Listen, practice. Really, if you become a prime minister or a president, do me a favor. Practice on the religion and about you.
