Come on, get it together, B. It don't look good. Hey, what a way, Britney. Go on, Britney. I'm a nice and clean friend of Nicky's, 6A. So I don't want a place where I don't want to party. Do you know where it's going now? Casabelle, Marcus Garvey Drive. Hey, what about Claudette? Claudette, why are you setting so much fire for? I must say it's Sun City, you know. Hey, no way are you doing Claudette. Hey, shout out to the Central Village! Hey, Sun Millie! Here we go, put it by the time it's now 9.30 p.m.
