============================================================

For united we stand, divided we fall And if our backs should ever be against the wall We'll be together, together, you and I For united we stand, divided we fall And if we're bound together, be against tomorrow We'll be together, together, you and I. And if the world around you falls apart, my love, then I'll still be here.
