20251222 183619 Having gone to the western parishes and having seen the destruction there, I started singing We Shall Rise. But I know there was a song, We Shall Rise, some time ago. I think it was after one of the disasters in Haiti. So I was mindful not to mimic what was already out there. But then I came up with the words for this song it's it's the title is of course we shall rise and it's it's quite fitting because the storm the effect of it means that persons are at their lowest but together we will of course rise from it So I sort of put the lyrics together to match the circumstances. We shall rise, we shall rise, yeah, yeah. We shall rise in the aftermath, yeah.
