I'm already falling in for ya Falling in love with who I am I don't have time for anything that's gonna harm me It may be hard to understand Words have the power to empower or destroy me now I'm looking in the inside now Claiming what I lost and found I'm on this journey Returning to the old me So I can fix your lonely Gotta fix the homie now Don't need no one to hold me But only if you can hold me down Some things really happen for the better I had to take a fall so I could settle Found my peace and grounding now I'm leveled
