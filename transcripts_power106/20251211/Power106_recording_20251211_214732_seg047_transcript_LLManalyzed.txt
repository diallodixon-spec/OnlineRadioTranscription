And just have something to eat and drink and share with others, you know. Oh, so you're not a fussy man? Eh? You're not fussy? Says Minata. I said you're not very fussy. Yes, man. We just want to know if we can eat and drink and share what we have with each other, man, and just make yourself happy. Yeah, man, because we appreciate you, you know. So I like him. He blesses me that I can call him some people and say, come with me, because some people, they have nothing in here, you know, so we still have to look out for one another.
