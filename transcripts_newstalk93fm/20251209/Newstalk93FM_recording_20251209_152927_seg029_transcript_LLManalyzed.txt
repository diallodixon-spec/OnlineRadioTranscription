And I think you're ready for more. Yeah, now let's get on up. See, oh, a lot of mirrors When you put the bones next to mine, the brains go crazy And I love what you do, it's so sad Can't go missing, could stop for now You know I'm crazy, for you I'm ready Boy, I like your style The way you put it down Let's go another round Ooh, tell me how that sounds, how that sounds Make your body wet wet wet wet wet So can you let up and down?
