20251226 214734 No faces, no cares in this world Where a girl loves a boy and a boy Loves a girl Last night I dreamt of San Pedro It all seems like yesterday, not far away Travelling through the island rivers, all of nature wild and free This is where I long to be, La Isla Bonita And when the sun will play, the sun will set so, ring through my ears and sing my ad, your Spanish lullaby. Tropical, the island breeze, all nature wild and free, this is where I long to be, La Isla Bonita, and when the summer plays.
