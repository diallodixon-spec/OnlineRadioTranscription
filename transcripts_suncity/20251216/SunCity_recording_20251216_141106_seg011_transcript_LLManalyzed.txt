20251216 141106 We're gonna pass out this message once again, shout out to Frostdash! Remember, you know, we're trying to see if we can organize that thing and, you know, prep and go out there and up to 200 people, you know, the least 200 people, we're gonna see if we can try and help out, but you must include having a baby at home. So, you know, once you got a kid or if you know a family out there in needs of support and, you know, in basic needs, because you know, after the passing of a category five, you know, it ain't so straight, you understand? So, yeah, we're campaignin' and see if we can go out there and just fix things. But you gotta have, you have to, you have to. It's a must. You have to have a child at home also, alright? We're not catering for nobody. Yeah, you know how the life is spreading love, but the future is a must. So, we're spreading the love. Once again, Frosty.
