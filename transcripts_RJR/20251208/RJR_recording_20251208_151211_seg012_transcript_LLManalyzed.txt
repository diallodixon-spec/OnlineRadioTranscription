When you get lost and caught up in the clouds of doubt And time confused you can't find your way out Now for the thieves who over stand you feel alone in the crowd Just keep marching on Oh, yeah Come make we stand up big up high, the freedom warrior From Egypt, Turkey, North Korea, Iran and Syria Pray for the victims of the madness in Nigeria The looting and the shootings are with fear Time and keep on moving Freedom our animes. Keep improving, that it's up to people on earth to run red. Keep it moving, Freedom in our animes, keep improving, that it is up to people on Earth to run red.
