In the September general election, they increased their support for us by some 100,000 votes and doubled the number of constituencies we represent in parliament, increasing our members of parliament to 28.

As Jamaica faces this long and hard road to recovery, the parliamentary opposition has sought to play our constitutional role responsibly.
