Oh, baby, I love you every day. I want to tell you I love you everyday. I want wanna be with you night and day. The moon appears to shine and light the sky. With the help of some fine fly. I wonder how they have the fire to shine, shine, shine. Well, I can see them under the vine. But don't, oh, no, no, hesitate, la-di-da, cause you're alone.
