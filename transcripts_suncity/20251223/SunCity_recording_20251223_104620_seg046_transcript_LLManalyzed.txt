20251223 104620 Please don't speak my name Just say goodbye It's too late to lie I've been in love already so I felt re-learned But I couldn't have imagined it could get any worse Realizing I don't know you is just real absurd I really got to say you got away with words All those moments we shared, you bare me your soul Behind the perfect smile were just lies that you told Said you'd always be there, I believed you for sure By what you disappeared when I needed you most My life will never be the same You made your choice And I will not complain Don't raise your voice Please don't speak my name Just say goodbye
