I know it's gonna be the way. Oh, yes, it's gonna make me stronger. Hey, watch out now. Hey, see y'all now. You see the yandex and the struggle and the hustle. He'll be back on and be to sell and be muscle. So we fight it with the rain and adrenocle. So we can't go built under depression or no buckle. Get free and just banter disappointment and no nothing. Cause when one's low like a boat, I'm in the air and I won't move. But if I swear to God, that me to be a commander doesn't, we all live on, we won't know why no trouble. But anyway, it can't say yams because inna we may be calling. If we're on the stage, if we jump, I'm on a set. If everything gets smooth every day, we would know we could overcome. Because if we don't, kill me. It's just kidding. I know it's gonna kill me.
