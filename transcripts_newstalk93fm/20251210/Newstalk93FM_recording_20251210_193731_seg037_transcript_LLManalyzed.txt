I need to get the sadness out my brain. It's driving me insane, Lord. I think I'm losing it. I could be where my body's crept in. Cause it's so long I've waited. I think I am a groupie for crept in. I think I a groupie for winding down. And if I am groupie, die not dead. I will be a groupie, till can even die Yeah They calling me a Onana boy Onana boy Hear me now Say what you want I have nothing to prove I ain't fessin' so long, think I'll be fessin' today I walk in around, like I just lose my puppy I feelin' so down, I think I really lose it next I need to get this sadness out my chest
