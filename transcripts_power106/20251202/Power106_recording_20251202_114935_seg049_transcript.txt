That's the point. So we need to hear all of those details from the Minister of Finance today when she speaks in Parliament. And we need opposition people to ask relevant questions and don't be stonewalled and then run from Parliament and go up on social media. Because that not help the people. You have 28 stand up and ask questions in the interest of the people. You know, I keep saying to people that the opposition is actually government and they seem not to be able to get it. Yesterday was quite interesting. You know, they don't seem to get it at all. They don't seem to know that Mark Golden gets a salary and that the the members of parliament where opposition gets a salary. They get a salary and they actually are part of the legislature. Precisely. They don't get that. So they must resist any attempts to exclude them through Stonewall.
