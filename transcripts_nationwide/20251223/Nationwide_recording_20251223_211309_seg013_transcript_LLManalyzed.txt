I don't have to like her. I'll probably tell him I don't like her, but I don't HAVE to like her because it's not my choice at the end of the day. She better off if you like her, though. No, not really, because it's his decision at the end of day. No, no, no. I never ask going to ask about him. I said she's better off if you like love. Join the family. Super happy, super healthy, Super Med.
