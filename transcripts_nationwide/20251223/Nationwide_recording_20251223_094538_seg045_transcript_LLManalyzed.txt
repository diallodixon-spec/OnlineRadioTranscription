That don't do it, but they should. But it's not enforced, it's not enforced. But then that's on you though. If you want to do something further down the line and your taxes are checked and they are not in order, it's on you. You will have to go and find the money when that time comes to pay. If you don't, then sure, it's not enforced, but there is a system in place for you to do that. You know, one of my points on that matter is that these people don't pay their income tax, don't file their tax returns to pay their portion of the income tax in the country.
