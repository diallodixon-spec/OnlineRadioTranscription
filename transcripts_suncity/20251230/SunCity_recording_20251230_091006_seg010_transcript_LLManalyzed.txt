20251230 091006 I walk like it's already done They've been attached to my name Since before I was born I don't shrink to make room Rooms rise when I come Alignment ain't a moment Baby it's where I'm from I don't beg for access I am the access I don't chase the seat I inherit the Nothing about me is pending or trying. I live in a prayer I used to pray for. I'm already hurt, chosen before I ever arrived. You can see it in my aura. You can hear it in my life. I don't want force. What's mine? It comes because I'm alone. I'm not becoming the woman. I am the woman. I'm already her. I don't compete. There's no race when you're close. I don't lower myself. I cost too much to fall. I don't convince anyone ever to fall.
