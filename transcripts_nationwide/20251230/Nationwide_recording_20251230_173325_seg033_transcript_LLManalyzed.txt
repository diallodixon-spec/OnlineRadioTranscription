20251230 173325 attorneys were adamant, although we asked them to consider trying the matter as a judge alone, they said that they wanted the jury. So that was another two and a half years. So thankfully, the matter went to the Westman and was transferred, and we were able to get the matter started. And Ms. Jackson, the law allows us, once we are able to establish the criteria, even if a witness is dead, a witness cannot be found. Once we have our legal research, we have our authority, once we lay the foundation, we can still put in a statement. So we were able to do that with a couple of the witnesses. So I can say once again, yes, it may be that it went through at this slowly, but I always like to put context so that people can understand. And then we take it from there in a positive way to make sure we try to minimize along with the other stakeholders. Because one hand cannot clap. The DPP's office alone cannot.
