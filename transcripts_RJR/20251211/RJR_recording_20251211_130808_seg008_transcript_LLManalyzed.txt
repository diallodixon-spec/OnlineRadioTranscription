ever loved me you are my shining star my guiding light my love as you see there's not a minute hour day or night that i don't love you you're at the top of my list cause i'm always thinking of you i still remember in the days when i was scared to touch you how i spent my day dreaming planning how to say i love you you must have known that i had feelings deep enough to swim in That's when you opened up your heart and you told me to come in Oh, my love A thousand kisses from you is never enough I just don't wanna to stop all my love A million days in your arms is now too much
