20251229 204229 I should've seen who I thought was my friend. They wouldn't answer my phone calls. I'm walking pregnant in the snow trying to get a record deal. You know how bad it can get sometimes. I never thought I'd get out of pain. And I know a lot of you felt the same. But I'm standing here today to testify. I got joy in the morning. I've got joy in the evening. I've got in the midnight hour. I got joy, joy, joy. So much joy. I've got so much joy. See one day I was walking along the street with my head down so low.
