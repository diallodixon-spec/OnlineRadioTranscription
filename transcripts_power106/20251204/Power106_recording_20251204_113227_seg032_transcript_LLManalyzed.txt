I may have to withdraw at least some of my criticism of the minister, because be it someone, I see with the technocrat them. Them chair helper. Them chair helper, shenanah. Shenanah means trope and all them people down there. I don't know, I don't know. I'm being facetious, of course. But we shall see. We have to make sure that there's this broad-based committee, that this money is spent properly, because the man already said this is the most massive, the man said that 50 years is the most massive outflow, while we can't feed the people, we can't provide a good education. We can't provide good education. But you have to pay back the developed countries for the money. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So we have to be sober about this thing, man. We can't be a one-man show. I'm not sure I love this sober part, but never mind. We know. All right. So what can I say? You can say something.
