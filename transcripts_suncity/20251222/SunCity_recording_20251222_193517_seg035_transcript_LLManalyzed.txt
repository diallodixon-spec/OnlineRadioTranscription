You only live once, you're not live twice, yo. Follow the road on the righteous path, stay focused and conscious, put your head on the side. Don't make the wicked, them corrupt your heart. Do the right thing, become the work, yes, yes, all. Take away yourself from trouble. Better move, cause it come in a double way. Take away yourself, from trouble. From trouble. I say mind is sinking, son. Take away yourself. From trouble, take away yourself.
