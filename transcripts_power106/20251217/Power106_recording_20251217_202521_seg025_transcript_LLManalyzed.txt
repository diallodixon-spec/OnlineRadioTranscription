But you have food to eat, you are able to get to work every morning whether it be you drive your own car, your walk, whatever. Small things, it don't have to be big things. And the small things add up. And if we keep focus on those things, rather than on the things that are difficult, then you know, I think that helps. But for me as a Christian, one of the things that, one of my favorite verses, we go to Philippians, it says be anxious for nothing. But in everything through prayer and publication, with thanksgiving, which is what gratitude is, make your request known unto God. And when we do that, it promises that the peace of God will decide our hearts and our minds, Christ Jesus.
