Did the house thing and but the water lever? When we got with this when I went when medicine took off the the top of the garage and the young men came in, you know, I and Kathy from the community came and pulled pull the thing Apart and just put them one side so I could take out the car and they said Take it up the road and I go up the road with it by the the time I got there was a race with Keva, Rita and Ricky. They were about to get, you know, houses. What? Yes, I saw the water coming and racing and I'm saying, my God, I need to, everybody was shocked because we had about five or six cars that covered in the community. We didn't get enough time, we didn't get the water comes in so quickly that when I got in the hose and my laptop, I had it packed, I had some food packed somewhere in the car already and so forth and by the time I turn around the water was at my waist and by this I was scared.
