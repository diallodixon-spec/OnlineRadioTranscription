20251218 133919 Hey, we play this one for Cindy from Puppy Lofty. You were the key. You got out the best in me. You helped me to be stronger. You kept me moving longer, baby. You were the light. You brightened up my darkest nights. Now you say I'm strong enough to be on my own. I can't make it all alone.
