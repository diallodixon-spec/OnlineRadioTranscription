============================================================

I love you more than anything, anything. More than my money, more than my job, more than mama and my daddy. Come on, say I love you. I worship and adore you. You just had to take a minute and tell you. Lord, I love you. Can't nobody do me like you can. I love you. Nobody deserves the glory.
