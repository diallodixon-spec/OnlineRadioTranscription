20251222 183233 Hello, good evening and welcome to the Business Report here on Nationwide 90FM. Governor of the Bank of Jamaica, Richard Biles, says controlling inflation following Hurricane Melissa is a key priority for the central bank. Governor Biles stressed the importance of the mandate during a media briefing on Monday. He says taming inflation at this time is at the forefront of the bank's thinking, even at the cost of short-term economic growth. The country has already seen steep price hikes following Hurricane Melissa. There are expectations there will be further increases in the coming months. The increases are seen as unavoidable following the significant loss in productive capacity triggered by the unprecedented hurricane. And internationally the US is immediately pausing leases for offshore wind energy projects currently being built near the Atlantic Ocean.
