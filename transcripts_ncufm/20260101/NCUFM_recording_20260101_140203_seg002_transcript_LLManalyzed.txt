20260101 140203 paid with our driver for this afternoon's show, so whether Michael, whatever you do, just plant it with hope, water it with faith, and trust God to give the a.k.a. Pal from Portmore, on the drive. Blessings. Even though I've been here for a while I smile, smile It's so hard to live up when you've been down Sure would hate to see you give up now You look so much better when you smile, smile
