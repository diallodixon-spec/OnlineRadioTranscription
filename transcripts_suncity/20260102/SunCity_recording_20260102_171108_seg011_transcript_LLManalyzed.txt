The men, identified as 37-year-old Silva Santos and 44-year-old Antonio, were working at the S Bend back dam when a quantity of sand collapsed into a pit on December 30. While other workers escaped, the two men became trapped and were later retrieved unresponsive. Police say the remote location has delayed transportation of the bodies, which are to be taken to the Madea District Hospital for postpartum examinations. Investigations are continuing.
