20251216 164928 You Underneath the Christmas tree, I don't need to end my talking, live upon the fireplace. Step across to make me happy, when the soil's Christmas dead. I just want you for my own, more than you could ever know. Make my wish come true. All I want for Christmas is you. You, baby. Oh, I won't ask for much this Christmas. I'm only here for you.
