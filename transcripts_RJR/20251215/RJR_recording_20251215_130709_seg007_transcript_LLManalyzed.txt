20251215 130709 I miss you. Every time I think I'm falling, I know you're falling too. There's no doubt you're holding on. If you ever think you're falling, you know I'll catch you too. Cause all I am is you. Every day dream I have stars and ends with you i wanna play it one more time when i need an alibi you're my perfect excuse you're always on my side cause all i know and all i am is you i'm breaking my silence cause i've had a few i just can't deny it from love at all
