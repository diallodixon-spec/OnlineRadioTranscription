20251222 174228 moment when you all realized okay the final five years old, you were watching State Celebrate and wanting to be a part of that? when I was attending Santa Fe and I was asking dad when is the celebration so he told me that I had to go to school so I was like no dad but I attended school that day and I told him after I will win that as the cup for myself then so I can get the celebration of my own so I think I've deserved it now. Sounds like it for sure.
