20251225 164622 I do so empty my heart, my soul Can't go on, go on baby without you Rainy days fade away When you come around, say you're here to stay With me boy, I don't want you to leave me I, I need you Never knew what I was missing I never knew When I shut my eyes please for a kiss I found, I found you Never never knew I'd never miss you Never, never knew what we'd start kissing I found you, I found you
