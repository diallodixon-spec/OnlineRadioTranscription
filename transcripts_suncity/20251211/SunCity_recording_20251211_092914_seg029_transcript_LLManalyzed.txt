I was in like high school when this started to happen, more advanced social media, internet thing. And the thing used to come up on the screen about you winning something or click on this and you can win things. And of course we gave the computers virus at school and all of that. But after a while you learn. What I'm saying is, and you said it too, if somebody said to you, or you get an email and they say congratulations, you have have won all you have to do is send $200 okay take the $200 out of what I've won and send me the rest and if you can't do that then keep your money yes and Kimi says I always say those who got scammed as greedy if you didn't enter competition how can you win yep we all agree all right guys we have to take a quick break but when we come back we will be speaking to our doctors so stay tuned and next up is black healthcare
