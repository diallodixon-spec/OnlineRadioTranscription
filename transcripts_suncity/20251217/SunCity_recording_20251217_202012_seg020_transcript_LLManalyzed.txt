20251217 202012 You give me the strength and me bless you give me grace and me powers. Not without you. Nothing could happen without you. That's not my life, not without alone. Told them find me, set me hard, nailed up strong. But I got to praise the most I sit upon the throne. Sometimes I think I'm doing so wrong. But the most I hope kept me strong. Let me know my purpose and where I belong. So I got to sing my song. Not without future. Not no good, not awful without future. Not without future, are you givin' me the strength? I need less who give me grace, I need more what? Not without future. No no good, no awful without future.
