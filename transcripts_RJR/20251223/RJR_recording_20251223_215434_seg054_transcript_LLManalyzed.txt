20251223 215434 Thank you for staying with me on Balancing Justice. I'm your host, Andre Earle, sharing tales from the courthouse. So let me go straight now to Anthony. Anthony, go ahead for me, please. Yes. So my friend from the West mentioned about some rum. So I did a murder, a rape case. Very, very interesting. I had some great laughter because the judge had laughed as well. So my client was charged with rape, but the long and short of it is that he had sexual intercourse with this young miss. Of course, in our 30s. But that young miss had a relationship with another gentleman and so when she had sexual intercourse with my client she came home late and so she had to give her a perfect excuse or an alibi so to speak accounting for her lateness.
