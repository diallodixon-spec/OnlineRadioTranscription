It's just me, myself and I Solo ride until I die Cause I got me for life I don't need a hand to hold Even when the night is cold if the clouds were shedding no tears I'd have everything I need right here As long as you're next to me And even if the stars forgot to shine Even if the moon escaped the sky And even if I search out till I'm blind
