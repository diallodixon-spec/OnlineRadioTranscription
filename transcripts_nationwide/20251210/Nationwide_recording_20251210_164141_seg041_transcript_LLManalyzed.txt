You are walking through me Like a girl you are walking through me Too nice people I'm on problems So I don't worry about them I depend on baby I'm in Bangkok apart I don't need boyfriends But too real for you to worry about fitness I don't care about all who narr know They don't know that I'm a real top gel They don't know I'm real top gel, real top gel Real top gel, I can do it natural They don't know, they don't know They don't know that I'm a real top girl They must know that I'm real top girl Real top girl, real top girl I can do it naturally If your bed don't got no bed head baby girl You won't sleep on table And if you still don't wanna come back Wanna seek a real life on stage
