Get out of sight And while the entertainer's singing his song I hold a feeling oh so strong I never thought love would look me in the eyes I lift my head oh what a big surprise I may have won the prize From the very first time I looked in your eyes I knew love would last forever It's a blessing to be with someone like you No no baby, can't let you go Oh no no no no no I can't let you walk out of my life No no baby Can't let you go. It seemed like only yesterday.
