20251217 170708 arrived in the island to assist in the restoration exercise. The workers arrived over the past two days from Canada and the United States. In a media release, the JPS and the Linesmen were brought in as part of its continued efforts to accelerate electricity restoration for customers impacted by Hurricane Melissa. On Monday, over 60 line workers from the recently contracted company Greystone Utility Services in Canada arrived in the island. On Tuesday, another set of over 40-line workers from Tempest Energy landed joining their colleagues, some of whom have been in Jamaica from just before the hurricane. The JPS said the arriving teams represent a significant boost in field resources focused on repairing and rebuilding damaged electricity infrastructure, now mainly in the hardest hit western parishes. The new line workers are being immediately deployed to join the restoration teams in these parishes. Another contingent of workers from Greystone arrives in the island tonight.
