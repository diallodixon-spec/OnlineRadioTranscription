20260101 162019 Your eyes only can see me through the night For your eyes only, I never need to hide You can see so much in me, so much in me that's new I never felt till I looked at you For your eyes are blue, only for you You see what no one else can see And now I'm breaking free from your eyes of blue Only for you, the love I know you needed me It's better to see you dreamin' me Only for you
