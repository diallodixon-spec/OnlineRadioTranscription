20251212 102417 I have a lightning spirit Early in the morning I hat it Me cooler ready, me eyes done ready Me punching that's automatic I have a lightning jumbie A kind of energy inside me And it ready for the rum Ready ready for the rum, ready ready for the rum ready for the action A spiritual encounter in me soul faking over telling me to start up the drinking and do away with good behaviour so let we go, let we go down the road let we go, it's action time let we go it's bacchanal time let we go
