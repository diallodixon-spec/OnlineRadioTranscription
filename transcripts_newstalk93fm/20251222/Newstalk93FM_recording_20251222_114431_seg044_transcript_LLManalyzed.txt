It's Mars and Riddy Man Soaker And I'm ready for the rum Ready, ready for the rum, ready, ready, ready For the rum, ready for the action, boom! The sweating spirit havin' me feelin' good! I have a linin' spirit Early in the mornin' I hat it Me cooler ready, me high's done ready Me punchin' that's automatic I have a Linin' Jumby A kind of energy inside me And it ready for the rum, ready ready for the rum Ready ready for the rum ready for the action A spiritual encounter in me soul taking over Telling me to start up the drinking and do away with good behaviour So let we go, let we go down the road
