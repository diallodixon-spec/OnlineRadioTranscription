20251223 202313 Sweet, sweet Jamaica The sun will shine, the pain will fade We'll rise again, unafraid We see the look on every angle Neighbours come together Love gets stronger, no light, but still we see If no food, oh, I tell you, we got plenty on board Be proud of the island fight Spirit of the people, spill the light We rebuild with hearts and pride One love, one key, together we're strong, one family. Be the bad Jamaica. Sweet, sweet Jamaica. Be only to you, let our new bad sweet Jamaica. From the hills to the sea, let love be the key.
