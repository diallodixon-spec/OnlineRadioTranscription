20260101 102922 I know you feel where I'm coming from Regardless of the things in my past that I've done Most of it really was for the hell of the fun On a carousel so around I spun With no direction just trying to get some Trying to chase skirts living in the summer sun And so I lost more than I had ever it out And I don't wanna sound redundant But I was wondering if there was something that you wanna know But never mind that, we should let it go Cause we don't wanna be a TV episode And all the bad thoughts, just let it go Beautiful ghosts all over the world I could be chasing but my time would be wasted They got nothing on you, baby Nothing on you, baby They might say hi, and I might say hey But you shouldn't worry about what they say
