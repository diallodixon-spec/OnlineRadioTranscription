20251226 115531 This is how we do it All hands are in the air And wave them from here to there If you're're an OG Mac or a wannabe player, you see the hood's been good to me. Ever since I was a lowercase G, but now I'm a big G. The girls say I got the money, hundred dollar bills y'all. If you were from where I'm from, then you would know that I gotta get mine in a big black truck. You can get yours in a six ball. Whatever it is, the party's underwear. So tip up your cup and throw your hands up and never hear the party say, I'm kind of a sorokan. This is how we do it.
