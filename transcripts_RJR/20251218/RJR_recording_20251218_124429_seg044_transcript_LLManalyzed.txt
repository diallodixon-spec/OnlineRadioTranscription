20251218 124429 to start our tour distribution soon. So, we hope you can stop by the ministry's tent. Yes. To help to distribute those but that's that's absolutely. Absolutely. So, really, really thank you so much. Let me say hi to Simon Shields who is part of the Shields team and he's capturing great photography, great videography at the moment. Thank you to Judith as soon as they hover around and make sure I say that because I'm going to forget. So Mr. Price, when you think you're going to come back with some more cake? Because I think it's about between 600 people and probably 700 who are here. So when you're gonna come back with one extra? Well, the team is actively in the community. Actually, we are here every week because to replenish the tanks at the water shop, they normally last like two to three days. So by the time we fill them up, people come and take from them. So on the schedule that we have, we are in the community at least once every week. So we'll be here and the team, as you have your team here, our team is also here.
