I have no idea what kombucha is. What is kombucha? Okay, kombucha is a fermented tea. Now, they say that soda is like an imitation of kombucha. So imagine this is a discovery hundreds of years ago. In fact, it's so ancient, they're not sure if it's China or Korea. They're not quite sure where the story comes from, but someone was ill, and tea was fermented by accident. You know, these things always happen by accident. And they said, oh, but it tastes good, and it felt good, and it cured a person. And that is the ancient story of kombucha. Now, modern science does prove that there are beneficial bacteria in this fermented tea. And so, yes, it does help with digestion. It helps with bloating. And we use natural fertilizers.
