20251212 124728 I might as well get over the blues Just like fishing in the ocean There'll always be someone new Love's a bad time You didn't know But I've been through stormy weather Baby, baby, baby Just like my life, my last day Baby, baby, yeah Baby, believe it This time I keep my feet on solid ground Now I understand myself When I'm down Like the sweet sound of hit music There'll always be something new To keep the tables turning Hate is just a song But there'll never be an ending
