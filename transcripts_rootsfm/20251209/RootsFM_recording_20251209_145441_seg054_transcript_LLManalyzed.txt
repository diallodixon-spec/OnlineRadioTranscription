============================================================

in the street, in the street they say poor people ballin'. The juvenile living yam from manning. Where the black woman future me askin', where the system a do fishin', no. They hook the gallin' with five little lords on a race two, three, pickin' up on their own. Where the man, there no man on their own. Babylon up them in a jeep. They hook the juvenile living on the street, where you set them off and make it come out touchy-crum They don't know how if we clean or we're on But that freak can't not form no fool in our own Hallelujah! Get your youth we go on and on Are we gone? Hungry from morning till night come? No! Then what if we live our life so? No! Then I wonder if the youth them all go stop? No! I wonder if the ghetto all go drop? No. No. Then, I wonder if we're catching all the trap? No. No I wonder if job turning bad? No. No, no. Thank you, John. I wake up this morning, stand up and smile out when we see it storming. My vision's a better day's call.
