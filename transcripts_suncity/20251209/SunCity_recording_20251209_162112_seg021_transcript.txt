============================================================

I was holding on for a better day. The road is runny, but I'm strong. People want to hold you down. That is all a part of it. Realization on my destination. I don't have no time to stray I had this thing from birth Mama done tell me already I got this thing from Earth Mother nature beautiful I got to wake up this thing Put it on stereo I want you know, I want to know. Get the things higher, mash up the breath and go start fire. Hold on, get the things higher. Mash up the seat and go retire. See I was holding on, see I was holding strong.
