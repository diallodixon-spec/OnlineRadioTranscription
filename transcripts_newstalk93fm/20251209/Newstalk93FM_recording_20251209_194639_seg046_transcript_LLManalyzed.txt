You're man know that you out here over Getting on bad like that Girl what you do, tell me now Your girl know that you're breaking your back Belt in your waist like that, jamming on a bumper Cause every time you go home, you looking high It go cause problems Oh yeah, it go cause problems If you're constantly telling lie lie lie lie lie It go cause problems Oh yeah it go cause problems You better not guess like I'm the best Don't forget You must go back home Go home I'm telling you fast Don't forget you must go back home So go home So when you see Mama Lydia, why ain't you low, low, low? When you see she brand new stuff, so why ain't low, low? Rockstar!
