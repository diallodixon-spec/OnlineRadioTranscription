20251229 120605 And we have been praying about the murder rate to go down, and this year, God Almighty have answered our prayer. So for that, I'm giving God thanks for His goodness and for His mercies towards us today. So in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, and by the power of the Holy Ghost, Matthew chapter 18 and verse 18, it tells us today, whatever is bound and hurt is bound in heaven. And whatever is loose and hurt, it is loose in heaven. So in the name of Jesus Christ, we bind the strongman of motor vehicle accident.
