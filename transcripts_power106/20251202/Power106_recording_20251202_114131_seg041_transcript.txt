So we're saying to her, we want to hear from you now, what is the new debt-to-GDP ratio? That's one of the questions that she must answer in the Parliament today. That's another question that opposition people must insist that she answer because the nation needs to know. All right, so let's look at, let's take the idea then of paying down the debt so rapid and allowing infrastructure to become, you know, fragile and vulnerable. Okay, now let's say that we had not pursued it, we had gone the direction of barbados. We can't escape that. Let's say that we have looked at infrastructure, we have worked on some things, we had freed up some monies, we had made some areas in St. Elizabeth, West Milan, the rural areas are a little bit stronger. Would we be in this bind now? No, I wouldn't be needing to borrow so much money.
