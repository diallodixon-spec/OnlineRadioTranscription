20251216 135539 of the people of Jamaica is one thing but the poor reception is equally frustrating. Oh boy I'm sorry. Dr. Gale, your caller Alvin is right that they should boycott JPS but some people only drink ice water. What will those people do when JPS cut off? Dr. G, the severs who are supposedly good politicians promised during the election campaign to shed the current JPS contract and force them to reduce their prices or lose their ability to continue doing business. Instead, we are now giving them so much money that it would be quite unwise to get rid of them anytime in the future. Thank you very much. I hate when people are trying to apologize for a government and then their apology can only be constructed within the frame of attacking someone in a very thin, uninterrupted way.
