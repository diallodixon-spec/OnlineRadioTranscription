Dr. Maurice Dixon also noted that approximately 111,177 students and approximately 5,000 staff members have been affected by the hurricane. The Ministry of Labour and Social Security has set up an oversight committee to coordinate welfare interventions for its staff members impacted by Hurricane Melissa. Portfolio Minister Pranil Charles Junior says the committee will ensure that the activities are transparent, fair and responsive to the individual needs of the workers. The ministry will be making available to our staff counselling services, particularly to those who have experienced trauma or loss. We will be introducing more extended flexible work arrangements to help the affected employees return to work gradually based on their circumstances.
