20260102 185538 Oh, baby, why, why do you think that love just former me? Not on the dot, oh, baby, why? Why do you think that you're going to be sincere, darling, dear, all right. Love should have brought you home to me last night. You should have been with me, darling. Should have been right by my side, baby. Don't you care about me darling do to me what you do to me last night
