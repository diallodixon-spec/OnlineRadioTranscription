20251225 163421 Now virtue ethics emphasise that morality is about who a person is, not just what they do. A virtuous person acts rightly because their character naturally inclines them towards the good, rather than because of a desire for reward or fear of punishment. For instance, Billy, who is a student, he values honesty, and Billy will avoid cheating. Not just to avoid the consequence of cheating, but because dishonesty contradicts his moral identity. Billy is a good youth. But this is a key distinction from rule-based ethics, which focuses primarily on compliance with external standards. Christian ethics also teaches that virtues are developed through practice and repetition.
