But you know, it's not gonna get better. Well, it will get better. But some people are just gonna end up having their vehicle seized and then lose their license and all those things eventually little by little. And I bet you that the man who drives your vehicle. No, seriously, you don't have to drive your vehicle. Your own vehicle. No, you have other people's vehicle driving. And then the poor owners of it don. My grouse is about the taxes here in Kingston. All of them are charging us $180. We want to know what is the right fare. It's a rampart on every route. If you give them $200, they don't give you back any change.
