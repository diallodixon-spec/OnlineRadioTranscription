You just put John's name on the title for whatever reason. Mary now wants to sell the property. John has to be a party to that agreement because John's name is on the sale agreement. So that's one thing you have to be mindful of. And when the sale is finished, money has to be paid out to both John and Mary, unless John agrees otherwise. So early on the program, I was talking about the documents to be signed when we're selling property. I mentioned the sale agreement and the instrument of transfer. Another document I do right when everything is being signed upfront in the early stages is a disbursement document saying how the money should be shared between the sellers. You get that out of the way, you have that signed. So once the sale is finished, you don't have to be asking any questions. Once the money is coming to me, I just pay out to the persons on the title, however they instruct me to do.
