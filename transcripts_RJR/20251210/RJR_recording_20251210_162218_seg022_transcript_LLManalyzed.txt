Heart when a heart can be broken I've been taking on a new direction But I have to say I've been thinking about my own protection It scares me to feel this way Oh, what's love got to do? It's got to do with it. What's love, but a second-hand emotion? What's love, got to do? Got to do with it? Who takes a heart when a heart can be broken?
