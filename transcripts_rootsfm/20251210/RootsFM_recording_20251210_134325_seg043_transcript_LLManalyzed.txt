============================================================

And you see that I'm a happy man, a really grateful man, and that I'm living for love. Those lonely teardrops, I don't have to cry on them anymore. Those restless nights, no, I don't really know them anymore. Those awful days, no, they don't really stress me anymore. Cause you're as sick as me, my baby, with the strength of your love. Freedom! How is this true? A bunch of psychopaths, totally insane Are dented in a flick of rain And other men bring shame To those who wish to maintain life Good blood runs through their veins And mostly acid rain
