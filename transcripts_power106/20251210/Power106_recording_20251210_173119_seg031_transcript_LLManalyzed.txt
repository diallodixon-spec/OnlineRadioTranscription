And by the way, before you go, how can persons contact you and the team at Jamaica Turbo Repair? You can find us on the internet at jamaicaturbo.com. You can call us at 876-622-6294 or just visit us on our social media pages, jamaicaturbo.com, and you will find us there. Well said. Thank you, sir. Catch you next week. Thank you, Jesse. Thanks for having me again. Yeah, man, you take care. Great. Bye bye. Bye bye. Roger Biles there, the managing director of Jamaica Turbo Repair Services Company Limited. Please catch us next week, Wednesday, for part two of the discussion of the costs to repair damage to your vehicle caused by potholes on the road. It can add up to a pretty penny. We'll try to do better next week. That's it for today's edition of the Auto World. A big thank you to our production team.
