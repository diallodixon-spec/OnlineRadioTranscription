20260102 151909 Trust in love today Folks talk, that's what they do best But don't you let it get you down What scares us today, we will laugh at tomorrow. It's worth the chance you take for love. Cause when I look in your eyes, I realize there's no mountain too high for me to climb. So baby, why should we wait? We're just victims of fate. So hurry on. Hurry on. And follow your heart, baby. Give in to love. Follow your heart. Let love show the way.
