20260101 104223 How deep is your love, how deep is your love I really need to learn Cause we're living in a world of fools Breaking us down When they all should let us be We belong to you and me I believe in you You know the door to my baby's soul You're the light in my deepest, darkest hour You're my savior when I fall And you may not think that I came for you When you know down inside that I really do And it's me you need to show How deep is your love, is your love
