20251229 210304 I'm not the first to know There's just no getting over you You know I'm just a fool who's willing To sit around and wait for you. But baby, can't you see there's nothing else for me to do? I'm hopelessly devoted to you. But, there's nowhere to hide. Didn't you push my love aside? I'm out of my head. Hope you'll see devotion to me.
