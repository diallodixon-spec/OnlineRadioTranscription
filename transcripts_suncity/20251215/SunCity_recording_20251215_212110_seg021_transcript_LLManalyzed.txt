20251215 212110 To all of my jiggas and my kensies. If you're not here, if you're lovely. If you're Joshua, you're one, you're one. You're not in my category, see. All of my Jiggas and my Kensies. I guess I'm know it's fine. I never give up. I think it's time. I've got a picture of you beside me. And I can let you speak in my heart. So long, my cock-a-pops. Oh, yeah. Ooh, baby, Got a fist up your emotion. Got a hand inside the dreams. Got to leave it, got to leave it on the island now.
