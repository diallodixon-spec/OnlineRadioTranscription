20251226 151208 I wouldn't go to school, never fail up in a class No, I don't know what to do Papa never had me, so no money to run I know, better must come one day Better must come, try give me wings to fly So I can touch the sky Wings to fly me out. Check me out. You in to your speaker. House on the hillside, kickin' some FIFA. Mama in the kitchen, makin' chicken, act like FIFA. Tala, dala, dala beans. Life's sweeter, hard work pay a bretta. Hotscalifa wings to fly, so I can touch the sky.
