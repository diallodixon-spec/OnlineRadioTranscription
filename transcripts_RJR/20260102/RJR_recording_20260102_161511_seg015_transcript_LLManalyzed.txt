20260102 161511 I love you, everything I have is yours And nothing's gonna change my love from you. Nothing's gonna matter what you're gonna be. I love you. Everything I have is yours. And nothing's going to change my love. Nothing's gonna change, my love, from you. I love you, everything I have. Look up on the stage, it's a bird, it's a plane, it's the innocent crew. Ain't a damn thing changed too Who's next on the DJ train? Come in, kapak, and drive them insane! Ya, ya, ya, hey! Ya, ya ya, hey!
