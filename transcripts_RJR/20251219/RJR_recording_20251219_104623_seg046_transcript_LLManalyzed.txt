20251219 104623 Hello. Try this one one more time. Minister? Yes, I'm hearing you. Okay. All right. I'm holding on for a call to come through. Anything you want to say to us, a bit of information you want to get out while we're waiting for this call to be processed? Well, next year, we're hoping to get through this year, God's willing, and we have been championing the cause of mental health, especially for everybody. You know, Orville, Christmas as part of our Christian calendar is an amazing time of year for most of us it's a time when we Family members come home to visit and you cook the big food and relax enjoy get a little holiday You know gathering and so on but it's also a time of significant sadness for a lot of people
