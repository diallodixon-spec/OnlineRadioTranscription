20251226 105230 It's the beginning of her misery Cause I don't care whose school she's been, you see Cause she's still taking lessons from me Though she isn't in my top ten, still she is on my top. Sitting in the back bench, still she's a student of my class. The way she loves brings sweet, sweet memories. Maybe it's the beginning of a misery Please give me a chance So I can make my confession Although I was wrong Won't you please overreact
