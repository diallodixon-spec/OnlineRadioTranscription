============================================================

The time can never end The careless whispers are a good friend To the heart and mind Oh I've got no rhythm, but what's easy to pretend, I know you're not a fool. Should've known, should've had to cheat her. It's a waste of checks that I could've been given. So I'm never gonna dance again, the way I do.
