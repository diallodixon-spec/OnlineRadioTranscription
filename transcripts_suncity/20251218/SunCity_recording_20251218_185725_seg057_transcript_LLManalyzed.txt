20251218 185725 Thank you so much. So as we wrap up today's Sun City Youth Forum, which is going to be the final episode for twenty twenty-five. But fret not, we'll be back in twenty twenty-six. Different day and time though. All right. So fret not yourself to our Sunites who feel like we're a medal in their love of Thursday. Fret not, we'll be on another day, all right? So as we wrap for today's Sun City Youth Forum, we're reminded that Christmas is not only about what we receive, but about the impact we can make when we choose to give our time, our skills, our compassion, and our presence. We've heard today that service doesn't require wealth or status, just a willing heart and a desire to uplift others. To our young people listening, remember that even the smallest act of kindness can create lasting change in a community. Thank you to our panelists for sharing your insights and experiences
