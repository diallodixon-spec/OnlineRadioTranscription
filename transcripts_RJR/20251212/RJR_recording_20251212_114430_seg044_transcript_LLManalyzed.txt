2025-12-12 12:25:55 We're going to join head of group marketing and communications with NTB KC of Vaughan. This is a hotline. Tracy? Hey, girl, what's up? So, hold on. Why you look so vexed this early? They ain't just start. Lisa, it is so good to see you. But sorry you catch me like this, girl. My uncle said when I'm bailing, when my family go for clarity, you don't wanna hear the cries of the people they put on or something. Make matters worse, me hear hear half of the things they're missing and I don't sell customs. Girl, how you don't sell customs? Lisa, stop going like you don't have any sense. You don't see everybody talk about it in the media. You don't want to stop listening to hearsay. You ever experience that? Customs don't go in your package, suitcase.
