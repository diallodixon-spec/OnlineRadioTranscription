20251225 140205 I'm making sure this is a brighter day Christmas time again, time for family and good friends Christmas time again, oh I wish it would never end That special time of year, plenty good will and good cheer Let us celebrate and share, like howada is here Time we hug up, love up and ting Yam up, drink up and swing Cool and I'm clearing things This is what Christmas brings Remember loved ones Keep pleasant memories Count the good times by ones, twos and threes Many, many good times You will soon see the many blessings you've had Most definitely And that the good times are always the best
