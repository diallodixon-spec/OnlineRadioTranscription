When you want it to grow, call the pro. You may also grow your crop indoor, in containers from the confines of your patio, balcony or acres outside directly in soil. Whatever your choice, you'll need soil or potting media to anchor the plant roots, which also supply water and nutrients. Water is also a growing medium if you practice hydroponics. For best results, do soil and irrigation water tests before use. The preceding growing tape was brought to you by Evergo Hotline. Radio Jamaica, active for the good of our nation.
