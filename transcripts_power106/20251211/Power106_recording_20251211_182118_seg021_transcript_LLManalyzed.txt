2025-12-11 19:42:13 to be scoring more than one goal per match. Never mind your opponent. I think it's pretty special. That's a superb feat. I don't even think some of the greatest male players have anything remotely close to that. She's extremely dominant for Manchester City though. She's the goal to strike and she knows how to top the ball in the back of the net. It's always going to be something like that. But to say a 1.33, that's phenomenal. That's really phenomenal. That's something that I'm so proud of her for. I can't see her keeping up that strike rate for a long time. Because as she goes along, coaches will start to work her out. They will start to put a lot more pressure on her and stuff like that. But anything within a 1 or even a 0.8, 0.9 is a superb rate in this world of football right now.
