20260102 113422 talk. Andre Earl here sitting in for my friend and sister Emily Shields. Happy New Year again to you all and reminding you of the thought for the day, progress not perfection is what moves life forward. Even a small step is still a step. Go back to the phones. Hello, good morning. Hello. Good morning. Good morning. Happy New Year to you, sir. And to you, and you, and you and you too. It's a long time. A long time. Good to hear you. I trust all went well for you over the Christmas season?
