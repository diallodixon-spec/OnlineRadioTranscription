Let's give it this time. She get a lot of that from King Kabbakam I said this a nut shot this action A long time on the DJ in a dog A long time on a DJ rubber dog I come from nice off the air, yeah I come from nice of Jamaica But what you dread? Dance off to cop Dance off to laugh Click off to laugh Told you once to laugh People really see it and have to laugh What say my love? From out around the side you have to laugh Oh dem laugh? Oh, Lord, have mercy. In life.
