20251224 123424 I want you to know I wanna believe If I never hear I'm sorry I can't let it go Gotta let you go Cause it's killing me Jesus you know how it feels Cause you've been hurt before Don't wanna hurt no more I'm trying to hear you speak But my heart is growing weaker. Take this cup from me. But if you choose not to follow, please. Help me believe. Try. Can I believe? Help me. Let me believe. Jesus.
