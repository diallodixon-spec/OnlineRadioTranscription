Upon reaching the intersection of Anderson Drive, there was a buildup of traffic to the right, and then to the left was a group of persons, but because the sun was positioned, the position of the sun was directly in eyes, so it was difficult to see what was happening ahead until we get close to that location. We realized it was a group of person that were heavily vegetated, like they were looking for something.

Upon reaching Buster Mountain Highway, there I behold, with some man on the right hand side, we're going east.
