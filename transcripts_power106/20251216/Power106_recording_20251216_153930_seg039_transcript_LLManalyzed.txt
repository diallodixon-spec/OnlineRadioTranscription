20251216 153930 I want to thank JPS. I want to single out JPS on this program and give them, you know, tremendous thanks to the JPS team in Navarre and all the team in our parishes, LaVarre Allen and the team in all the parishes that have been there, supported us. Yes, we know that we are not 100% yet, but believe you me, they are doing whatever they can and I want to thank JPS and as I said the other but I have to think about JPS as well as one of those that has really. Our hotels, majority of them are opened. Our attractions are open. Our tours are open. Our inbound merchants are open. We have cruise shipping in our town. Everything basically is open.
