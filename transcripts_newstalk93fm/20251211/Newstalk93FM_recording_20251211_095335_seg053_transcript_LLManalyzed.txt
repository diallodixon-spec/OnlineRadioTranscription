have to take the child to the service vehicle and they took her, well I left before, you know I left the scene before but they said they were going to take her to the hospital where the parents would have met me, meet up with them there. Have you been able yourself or your wife, have you been able, have you able to get in contact to eyeball the parents of the child since? Yes, I was fortunate enough to meet the parents, both my mom and dad, and a little girl. Very jovial, very pleasant, very polite, smart, intelligent. I must tell you, if you interaction just seen her, when she saw him, she said, that's the man who come and save me. That's the man who was wearing the pink shirt. She remember the color of your shirt? Well, it was more orange than pink. She would have really seen it as pink, but that's alright. But nevertheless, just her saying that, for me it's a sense of gratitude to say thank you.
