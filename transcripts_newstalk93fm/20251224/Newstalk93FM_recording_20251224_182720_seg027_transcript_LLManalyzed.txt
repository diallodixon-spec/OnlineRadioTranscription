20251224 182720 Fuck it's cheap, so show me That you understand I like it Can you blow my mind? Set off my whole body If I give you my time Can you stretch my soul from it? If I don't wanna wait, I'm taking, take me where I ain't been before. Can you blow my breath, make me water. Make me swig. Make me harder. Make me lose my breath. Make me water. Hopefully, you can hear me.
