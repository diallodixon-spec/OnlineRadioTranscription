20251223 124333 I don't sail, but I seek you Till I found strength for my life And now I feel joy That no words can describe Oh, where, where else can I go? Until you hold on I know you'll restore me I can't live without you Lord Won't make it done by you I'm begging you Lord, please have mercy Thank you for one more chance
