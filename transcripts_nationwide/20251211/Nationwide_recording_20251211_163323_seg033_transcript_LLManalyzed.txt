2025-12-11 16:42:12 I'm never feeling down. You are my trusted friend. You take me away from the pain, and you bring me paradise. And when I look back, the days you brought sunshine in my life. It never occurred to me the first time I saw your face. I would fall so deep in love That your love can't be replaced Don't let it go, don't let it go
