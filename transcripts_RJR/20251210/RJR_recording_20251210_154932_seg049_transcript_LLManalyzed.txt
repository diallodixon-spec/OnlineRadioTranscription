wealth so while we're earning whatever it is we are earning we need to have a disciplined approach where we are putting aside and not just putting aside some of it having it put on instruments to earn income on top of the on top of your money for you all right so what the importance of that is when you have situations occur like Melissa, unforeseen circumstances, you would have funding in place because you would have prepared, right? When we don't prepare, just like if we didn't prepare for Melissa, anybody that didn't button down, do whatever, things can occur. It's the same thing with your financial planning. We need to be putting aside, because things are going to occur in life, whether a hurricane, some other form of emergency, etc. And we should have a little kitty that we could want, and the only way to have that is to prepare for it.
