20251231 200002 I think I've finally had enough I think I maybe think too much I think this might be it for us You know the bed feels warmer Sleeping here alone You know I dream in color And do the things I want You think you got the best of me Think you've had the last laugh Bet you think that everything good is gone And you left me broken down Think that I'll come on and back Baby you don't know me cause you're dead wrong What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
