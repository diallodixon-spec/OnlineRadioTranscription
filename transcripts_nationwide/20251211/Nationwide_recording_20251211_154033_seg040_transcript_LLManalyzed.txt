album on apple music jamaica of all time like that's a massive feat yes major it just hasn't translated to the billboard and that's what i want to see honeybee right um like why this story is so important to me and we've said this before even before we interviewed jr what case um that we kind of want to just understand how the sales and the things go right right because for me there's there's so many albums that have been released there's so many artists you know who've been doing things and by the way kudos to the top 10 always that every week when we report it as one of you said they must have swapped positions right you know it's bob is shaggy you'll be fantastic figure shawn paul and now sister nancy and sister nancy so i just want to see you know or current artists you know try and figure out what the blueprint is yeah and see how best you can follow that in your own way obviously but we want to see some more i recently yeah absolutely and it's to dominate across all arenas it's if because if the thing is right as we know reggae is more universally embraced
