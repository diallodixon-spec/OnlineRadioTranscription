Dominica's prime minister says the United States has not suspended its December 16 proclamation, imposing partial entry restriction on Dominican nationals. But clarifications from U.S. authorities mean most visa holders can continue traveling as normal. Skirt says Dominican citizens with valid U.S. visas, including tourist, business and student visas, may still enter the United States, with no existing visas being revoked. However, while visa applications can still be submitted after January 1st, 2026, new visas will not be issued for those affected while the restrictions remain in place. The government has been engaging U.S. officials and is seeking dialogue ahead of a formal review of the measures 90 days after they take effect.
