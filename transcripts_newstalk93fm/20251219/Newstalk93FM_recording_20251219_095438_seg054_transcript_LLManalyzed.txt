20251219 095438 I relax and take it easy. Cause you give me hope, hope. You're like the morning sun and I'm not alone. You give me hope, you're like the sunrise. No, I'm not afraid Cause you give me hope When I walk on sinking sand Feeling lonely in a crowd When everything's pulling me in every direction You're my anchor. You're my solid ground. All I'm searching for are five. You're medicine for my mind. You give me hope.
