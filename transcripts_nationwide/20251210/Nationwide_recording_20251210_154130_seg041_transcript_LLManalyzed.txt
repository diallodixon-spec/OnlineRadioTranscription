============================================================

I've loved and I've lost I've asked about you and they told me things But my mind didn't change, I still feel the same What's a life with no fun, please don't be so ashamed I've had mine, you've had yours, we both know, we know They won't get you like I will, my only wish is I die real Cause that truth hurts and those lies heal And you can't sleep thinking that he is still, steal So you cry still, tears all in a pillowcase Big girls all get a little taste, I'm pushin' me away so I give a space I'm feelin' with a heart that I didn't break I'll be there for you, I will care for you I keep thinkin' you just don't know Tryin' to run from that, say you're doin' that On your face, girl, it just don't show When you're ready
