2025-12-12 11:43:00 whether it was on the 25th of December that is disputable and we're not going there that's not what I'm talking about I'm saying that Christ did come in the world if there's some people that believe that this is the time and they want to celebrate it I know that Christ entered the world to die for my sin and so therefore what I am interested in doing is to appreciate to give God glory to recognize to love and adore and to magnify the name of the Lord God Almighty who came in the world for my sins. Amen. Hallelujah. Now, unfortunately, it has become commercialized too much and way out of work and it's not what it's really was intended for initially. But I want to remind somebody that every single one of us we have a responsibility to play and that responsibility is to look to the Almighty God and to seek him men are planning parties and dances and all kind of different things
