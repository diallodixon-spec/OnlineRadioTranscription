Wednesday at 8pm, right here on Power 106 and we're going to be talking football and what made a presentation of football with Mr. Charles Edwards, outstanding football instructor, particularly on the female side of Dean Trophies to his credit already and a man who knows the game in and off the field. Well, good evening to you, Charles. Welcome to Power Play once again. Cliff here. Good evening, Cliff. How are you? Not bad at all, my friend. And of course, it's a football discussion. So I'm very happy to hear from you. Sounds like I'm going to owe you a big check for that introduction there, though.
