The rain is gone. I can see all our stickers in my way. Gone are the dark clouds that had me blind. It's gonna be a bright, bright, bright, bright sunshiney day. It's gonna be a bright, right, right sunshiney day. Yes, I can make it now. The pain is gone. All of the bad feelings I've been suffering Here is the rainbow I've been praying for It's gonna be alright
