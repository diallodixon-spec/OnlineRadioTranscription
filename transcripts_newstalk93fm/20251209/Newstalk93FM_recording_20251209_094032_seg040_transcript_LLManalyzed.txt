Thanks a lot, Senator. All the best. God bless you. Good, good. All right. Good. Good. All right. So that's Senator Marlon Morgan there. And, you know, we want to speak with Marlon. All we ask is just for decency and just do it in a civilized manner. You know, the campaign is over. We seek to get information out there on this program for our people. That's all. That's my only interest here not about PNP JLP government or opposition you know we go to the heart of-op and allow things to just flow. And we have standard that we set here.
