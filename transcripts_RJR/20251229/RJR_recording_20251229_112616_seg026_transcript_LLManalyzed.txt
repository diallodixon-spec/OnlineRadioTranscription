20251229 112616 Good morning. Welcome to Hotline. This is Clive Mullings. Hello. Good morning. Hello. Good Morning. Good morning. Welcome. You can't turn the radio off. It'll confuse you. Hold on for a minute. Sure. Okay. All right. Back at me. And the same to you. All of the time it was not that I watched Mr. Mullins, so I have nothing to watch other than TVJ and CVM. All of my stations are gone.
