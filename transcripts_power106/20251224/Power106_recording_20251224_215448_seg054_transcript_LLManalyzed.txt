20251224 215448 it there when I got here. I don't want to say how many years I've been in this judgment, but you know, I'm here and I'm thinking of getting out of this judgment because this place is a nightmare. And your friend from New York, you know, that's your good friend from New York. That's Trump friend that he support friend Trump so much that whatever people said about Trump, he's defending Trump. But this guy's a nightmare. He's your friend. I don't want to say too much about that, too. So, I'm just here listening, and I don't wanna call you so regular, because the last time I called, people, you know, throw me under the bus, run me over. Even my local friends from Thailand, local here, there's a local place in Thailand they call local woods, that he's from that place in Thailand because I know he's a local midget so you know I don't want to say too much about that
