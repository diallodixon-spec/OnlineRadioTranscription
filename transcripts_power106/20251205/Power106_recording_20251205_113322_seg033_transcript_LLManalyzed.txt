So you have to protect your dome. I don't wear caps. One reason is there's very few caps made big enough to fit my head. So I have one that Kat Kordy gave me, which is a third world cap, and it barely fit the head. And then I have another one now from my son-in-law and daughter companies. And it fit my hand.
