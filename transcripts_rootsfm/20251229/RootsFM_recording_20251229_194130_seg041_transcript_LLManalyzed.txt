20251229 194130 Good bye my love You know that I wish you well, I wish you well I couldn't give you heaven, so I'm releasing you from hell You know that leaving you, oh it's so very hard to do And by the look in your eyes you feel the same way too so hold your head up high and try not to feel bad cause we gave it our all going on and on and on. Do, do, do.
