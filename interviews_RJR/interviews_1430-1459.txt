**Gospel Singer Josie Inspires with Powerful Message of Hope and Transformation**

In an exclusive interview on Radio Jamaica, gospel singer Josie shared her inspiring story of how she found her purpose in singing about God and spreading the gospel. Josie, who is married to a Jamaican, has been immersed in the island's culture and has fallen in love with the music, people, and food.

Josie's journey into gospel music began when she felt a calling to write songs about faith and transformation. She was signed to Quincy Jones' record label, but after feeling unfulfilled, she decided to pursue a career in gospel music. Her latest song, "Jesus is the Answer," is a reggae version of the classic Andre Crouch song, and it has been well-received by audiences.

When asked about her experience singing reggae, Josie said, "It feels natural to me... It's the only music I can dance to." She also shared that she loves arranging vocals and background vocals, and that she enjoys the process of making music in Jamaica.

Josie's music is not just about entertainment, but about spreading a message of hope and transformation. She hopes that her music will reach people who may not have a church background or who may be struggling with their faith. She wants her music to inspire people to drop their baggage and remember that they are new creations in God's eyes.

Josie's powerful message is evident in her songs, including "Everything About Your Name is Power" and "Jesus is the Answer." Her music is a testament to the transformative power of God's love, and her story is an inspiration to anyone who has ever felt lost or uncertain about their purpose.

When asked what message she would like to leave with her listeners, Josie said, "Don't feel like you've done something bad and you can't go to church... You are who God says you are... You are a child of God, you have purpose." Her music can be found on all major platforms, including Instagram, Facebook, and TikTok, under the name J-O-Z-E-E.

Josie's interview on Radio Jamaica was a breath of fresh air, and her music is a must-listen for anyone looking for inspiration and hope. As she prepares to return to Jamaica in March or April, fans can look forward to more music and performances from this talented gospel singer.
