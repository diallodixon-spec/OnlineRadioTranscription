God is always there for me Through the sunshine or through the rain Through the blizzard or through the rain God is always there For me Father, God, I just want to thank you for this chain link of love Brother JT, testify! Lord, I live to name one high. Lord, I love to sing your praises. Yeah, yeah. I'm so glad you're in my life. And I'm so glad You came to save us You came from heaven to earth to show the way From the earth to the cross my debt to pay From the cross to the grave
