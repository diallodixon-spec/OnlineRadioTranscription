I don't like it unless it from Linstead. Because mam was a teacher, so everybody used to care about bun coming here. And there was a bun there, you see man? It's round. Tough, but it's nice, you know? It's nice. You have to know how to cut it, Johnny. You have know how to soak it and eat it. So I tell you, you have different types of ways and guess what, everybody like them born different. I never like when people eat a bun and they say, my friend born you have to eat, I feel my auntie born you have to taste.
