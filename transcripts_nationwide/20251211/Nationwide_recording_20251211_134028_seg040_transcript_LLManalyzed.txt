She's like a blessing from above got to let them know that Talking about you Might as well I tell you by the thoughts that I've been hiding Unless so long I only know where to start Don't be offended if I tell you You're a hell of a kind woman Will you do something special tonight? I see you as a queen, and a lady No miss, no best, no lady The only thing sweeter than my honeycomb Keep up as the same, queen and lady Keep the standards steady The only thing sweet than my honeycomb Watch out, it's my world on the edge
