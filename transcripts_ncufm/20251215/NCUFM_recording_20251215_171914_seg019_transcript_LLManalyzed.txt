20251215 171914 Tell me how you feel, how you feel When you're feeling all alone, all alone No one to say I love you Feel like all your hope is gone, yes you do Try to call your best friend, yes you do. No one, no one has made it here, oh yes. Feeling kind of empty, yeah. Feeling like no one cares, no. My brother, don't you worry now. Your stars won't last forever. There's a man from glory Full of mercy and grace He'll pick you up from where you are Hold your hands to Him
