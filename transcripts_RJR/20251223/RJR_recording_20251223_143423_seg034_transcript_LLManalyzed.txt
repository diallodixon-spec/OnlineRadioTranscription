20251223 143423 just something that I you know enjoy well you still enjoy your serious career but when did it become a career path I want to say from I think as a teen because I started gigging at that time and my practice it was a discipline so I realized I took you know the discipline of having dedicated time for practice and then getting getting gigs to rehearse for and you have to be punctual with that you know so you gotta be you know know about time and stuff so yeah it became a career path after that i left high school and went to Edna and different opportunities presented itself from there yeah this is my path how do you think that formal foundation we talk about discipline which is a part of that, but that classical training, how do you think that shaped the way you approach other genres, reggae, soul and contemporary music today? I want to say it definitely shaped it.
