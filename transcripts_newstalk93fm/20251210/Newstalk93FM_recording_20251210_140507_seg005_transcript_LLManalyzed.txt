I'm not coming home tonight, not coming home tonight Inside the party, Carlos sent us a party to find me Not coming home tonight Not coming home tonight I'm drunk in the party, so why don't you go to the party to find me I was grabbed by the melodies, now the liquor take all of me And the bass knock my soul out and make sure soca won't let me leave I don't know if I'll survive Song after song, wine after wine I go sing strong and fit for life Weak like the masses, kryptonites You can't find me, we're bound for shaking Higher meeting, people vetting Soka playing, if they want it, no Tell them you can't find me out on the road I'm ready to, just left work, time to free up God I won't let me go Go send a search party to find me I out on the road all night Tell them that this room got hungry They will see me Wednesday
