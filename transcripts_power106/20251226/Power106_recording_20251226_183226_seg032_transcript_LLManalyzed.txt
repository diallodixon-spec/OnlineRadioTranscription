20251226 183226 Last night your eyes were telling me what words could never sing You needed room to breathe, you needed time to get away It's a will from your heart And I know just how you feel Your dreams are real And I would never hold you against your will And so I will wait for you Just as long as you want me to Yes, I'll wait for you I know you'll come through I hope you'll find the good things you need All the things you had with me Yes, I will wait for you, you know I'll wait
