However, there are some actions that actually do work. In a previous life, I focused heavily on land tenure, formalizing informal communities by giving people types of land and giving them a stake in where they live. There are some counter-intuitive programs I believe that we have to pursue. Touching on your favorite topic, that of re-socialization of our young people. That would mean a revolution in education and the state having to take on a parenting role for a few generations until we get parenthood.
