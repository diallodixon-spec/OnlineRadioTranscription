20251217 124421 I love you higher than anyone can count into the amount of love I have. And to inspire you when love is over, I can't do without your love. I love you higher than anyone can count. No way into the amount of love I have. And you explore what love is all about. Girl, I can't live with without your love. I love you harder than anyone can count. No way to be around. I could never arrive. What we have.
