20251215 190508 Hate speech proliferate in this country directed at the Jewish Australian community that needs to be curtailed Her report goes to ways to deal with that on campuses in the private sector in government in the community more broadly There are measures there that should be taken up as a matter of urgency But they're not and I think they're sort of squibbing it by saying they're still working on it We've got to get on and do this urgently. So Cam Redden just ran through. We'll get to gun reform now because, I mean, this has become the focus for the government now, wants to put restrictions, the amount of guns you can have only by Australian citizens. That's just a few. Would you support that? Do you support that or should it go beyond that? Look, I think let's see the detail. What they've asked is state and territory governments to go away and work up options and that will take time. If they had these reforms in place before these awful events occurred, would they have still occurred? Who knows? But people who want to inflict harm are going to do it, if not with guns, with explosive devices, with knives. That's not a reason not to act. As an opposition, we'll see what's put forward by way of reforms.
