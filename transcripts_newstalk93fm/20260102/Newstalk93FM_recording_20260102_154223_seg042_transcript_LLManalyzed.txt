20260102 154223 I've been wandering all day I tried to be fine but I can't be The noise in my mind wouldn't leave me I tried to get by but I'm burning And behind my mind it runs All these thoughts I'm traveling Fighting to give up my pain Fighting to be on my lane My, running to the other side When it's time to leave my life, then it tries to take me love that you cannot mix one is the joy
