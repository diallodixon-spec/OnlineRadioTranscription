20251231 115331 Gracious and eternal Father, we come before you acknowledging your goodness, your compassion, your love, and your care. As this year draws to its quiet close, I pause now along with those who are listening, not rushing ahead, but really reflecting on how good you have been to us, how good your presence has taken us through what can be considered a fairly challenging year for many. We thank you for carrying us through days that sometimes it seems as if we understood what was happening, then we realized we really did not and also nights that we never understood what was really taking place you gave us strength and for that we are happy strength when we were weary for mercy when we fell short
