2025-12-12 15:28:25 What's the name of the primary school? Goshen, Goshen Primary School. Goshen Primary School, okay, good. And in front of her parents' home, there is a broken pipe. Yes. And I saw her in person and asked, did you report it to the water commission? She told me yes, twice. And just you know, it's two weeks now and nobody pay any attention to it. Listen to me. I called Simon's program today. I was explaining to him. And he said I should call the water commission despite the fact that somebody did it. And I called that place around two hours straight. And every time they tried to transfer my call, the operator answered me. The phone just rang until they just hear it cut off. Now you want them to say that the government have paid them money that is not offering a service?
