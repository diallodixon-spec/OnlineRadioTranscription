We don't know who they are. Okay. I know though. Okay. Okay. Thank you. All right. Somebody was asking me the source of the article that the title is law and the maroon state and it was published in the Jamaica Observer on January 8, 2022. I recommend it to you. I found I'm not finished reading it but I found it very insightful and helpful and very comprehensive. Law and the Maroon State by Professor Steven Vassiani, January 8, 2022, published in the Jamaica Observer. Yep. media, public radio. So we have to be careful. You on social media, you're not policed.
