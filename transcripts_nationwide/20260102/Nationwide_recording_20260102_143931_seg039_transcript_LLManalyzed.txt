20260102 143931 What I do for a little bit of peace and quiet Without you I keep slipping into bad dreams The days go by you and I Lose some when I fight I love you more than I need you to set me free From all of these bad dreams Made it on the other side Oh, so when I cry I love you when I need you To set me free From all of these, all of these Bad dreams Let it be, let it please come around Help me settle down, help me have some clouds in my head
