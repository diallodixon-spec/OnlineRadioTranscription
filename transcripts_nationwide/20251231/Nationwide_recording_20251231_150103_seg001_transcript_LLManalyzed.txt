Look, the boat don't sleep there Tell them we not leaving Till the last drop of a can of this Madness in the capital zone I feel like I run in town again Jump and shake the ground again We with all the run and them No place like home, home, home When we are signing this ocean of love All that we are lining to the stars above Let we dance now, take a chance now with me And we go down till morning, look the moon gone sleeping Tell them we not leaving, till we last drop off a cannon
