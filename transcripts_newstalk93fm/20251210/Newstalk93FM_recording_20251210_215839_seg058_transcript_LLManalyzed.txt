============================================================

I don't wish upon a star You're the answer to my prayers Was a dream, now reality True love is here with me You are, you are, you are You're the, answer to my prayers I love you so Never gonna let you go Wonder what to know, the answer to my prayers Loving you so loud, louder than the loudest loudest loudest Higher than the highest, the answer to the highest The answer to my prayers, the answer to my prayers. I know that God has me, cause you're with me.
