Residents of Windsor Housing Scheme in Silo, St Elizabeth are still awaiting action from the JPS three months after massive power surge damaged their appliances. The surge caused by a broken electrical wire on August 31 destroyed items including refrigerators, stoves, air conditioning units and other appliances. Although technicians repaired the line shortly after the incident and residents submitted claims, the JPS has not conducted damage assessments. Residents of Rocky Point in St Thomas are calling for the roadway leading from Hampton Court to be cleared of overgrown vegetation. The community is concerned that poor visibility could lead to motor vehicle-related incidents. Farmers and residents of Mount Vernon and nearby communities in western St. Thomas are appealing to the municipal corporation to address the poor condition of their roads, particularly their route to the Mount Vernon Primary and Infant Schools.
