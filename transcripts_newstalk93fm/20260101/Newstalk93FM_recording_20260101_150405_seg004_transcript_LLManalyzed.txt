Good people It's good people, we only unloved And you model and pose like you never do bad Things where you do say you never do that Run for the dream and you never look back Now money in your pocket say you're never too sad Boy, if money make you dance You'll be dancing forever To the beat of a drum that never go help ya But now hear me story, is you lax with me? Like I do you something, like I do you something. When I hear this show now, is you Lax with me?
