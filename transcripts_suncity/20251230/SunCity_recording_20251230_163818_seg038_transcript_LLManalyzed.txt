20251230 163818 With a heart of love that finds true love In a special way The closer I get to you The more you make me sick Sorry I left you Left you crying Since you've been gone, I've been all alone All of my tears, they left me drowning Baby I'm begging you to stay at home. Tonight, let's start our love again. Tonight, we can be more than just friends. The sun is burning.
