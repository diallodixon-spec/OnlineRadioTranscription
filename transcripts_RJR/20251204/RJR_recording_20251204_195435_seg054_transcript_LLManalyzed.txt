============================================================

Secure garbage in tied bags and covered bins and declare debris around your home where rats can hide. If you start to feel sick or notice any symptoms such as high fever, headache and muscle ache, see a doctor as soon as possible. That's it for today's program. I'm Monique Whitfield. Thanks for listening. The blood bank is always in need of blood. Give generously. The blood you give today may save your life tomorrow.
