============================================================

I didn't ask to go with you to Mexico I really didn't need the shopping spree in LA or Mero's Boy, if you didn't know it, well now you know I didn't need the furs or the jewelry Because material things don't mean much to me and ever since you've been gone I've been holding us down on my own and no I never let you, I never ever let you stop asking, asking me why why I never left you and why I kept it real and why I'm still with you You shouldn't know better than to think I believe You shouldn't know Better than to doubt me It don't matter if you're up, matter if you're down You shouldn't know that I will stay by your side
