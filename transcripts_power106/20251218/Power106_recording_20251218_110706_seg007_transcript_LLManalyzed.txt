20251218 110706 who would have been impacted and not doing anything at the moment. Tourist workers in the hotel industry who probably won't, and some of them not going to get jobs until next year. What kind of calculation in terms of the 3.5 unemployment rate? It can't be, it can't be because we have 250,000 farmers, right? Many of them are out of work right now. 20,000 BPO workers out of work. And a significant sum in the hotel sector which are out of work. So the unemployment rate can't be 3%. We had 1.4 million persons working when we said that the unemployment rate was 3.3%. Now when you look at what is happening, more than 300,000, 400,000 persons are out of work as we speak. And that is why we are saying to the governor of the Bank of Jamaica today, we don't want you to make a decision based on the flawed assumption that unemployment rate is 3.3%. It is not 3.3% as we speak now. That was July. We are now in December after the devastation.
