20251226 215238 I wake up every morning, I stumble out of bed Stretching and yawning, another day ahead It seems to last forever, and time goes slowly by The baby meets together, then it starts to fly There's a moment that is with me, time can take a flight The moment that it's with me, everything's fine My baby takes the morning train. He works from nine to five. And then he takes another home again to find me waiting for him. My baby take the morning train.
