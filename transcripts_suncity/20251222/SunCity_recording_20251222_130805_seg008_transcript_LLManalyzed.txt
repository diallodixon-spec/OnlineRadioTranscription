20251222 130805 Oh, my son, please be careful. And don't make me cry. I don't want to hold a minute or wipe the tears from my eyes. I'm feeling young once when I go to school. Go to school and learn to read and write. It's not just physical badness going on, it's spiritual badness. And if you cannot see with two eyes, then how are you going to open your third eye? Don't let the devil catch you. No, no.
