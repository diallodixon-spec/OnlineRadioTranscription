we have it sweet woman we have it greatest on the planet boy so for the radio love playing a song and it's going to fuck and if i lose myself inside this place well i show my shit up if this hookah unblast when the beat drop past the madness ones up just give me one more shot inside my glass and watch me level up Oh As soon as I reach the dance I leave my conduct on zero I love my culture and love where we from We get these powers from this same nation Sweet like steel, drum is with these vibrations Don't let the rhythm get you, just run, run
