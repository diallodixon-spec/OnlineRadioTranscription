20251218 201509 I'm gonna break these chains around me I'm gonna learn to fly again Maybe hard, maybe hard, but I'll do it When I'm back on my feet again Soon these tears will all be dryin' Soon these eyes will see the sun Might take time, might take time, but I'll see it When I'm back on my feet again When I'm on my feet again
