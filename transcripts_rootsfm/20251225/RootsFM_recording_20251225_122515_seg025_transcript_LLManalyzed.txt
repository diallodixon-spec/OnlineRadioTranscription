20251225 122515 Thursday night is jimmy night the hawk uptown on a friday night Now the youth man make them have some fun Let them know on them, they go lick no shot Low the sound since they make it nice off the spot They might tell us to turn it off They might tell us turn it down so low Not knowing that the people can't feel the vibe And the session can't stay alive They want us to turn it up They want us to play the song so soft
