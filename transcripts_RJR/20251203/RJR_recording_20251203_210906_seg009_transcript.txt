Without apology! They call him beg you, try to hold it off if you don't wanna wait Nobody wanna be themself, they want me wanna be It's like who love me gets a jam, make one of you and one of me Why they want me, modify and alter them and not admit them under the influence of sinfulness and vanity Less leaders but follow rise of the majority It's like the world lose them sanity Follow me, without apology, without apology Me pick up on a little trend, we start from bad to me No man know how fi look a work an earn a salary dem brad a fi Teeth and pick a leaf a for the dollar tree Just fi wear a jod and desert a roll a wallaby Body in a riches but the mind still in a poverty Nah breathe properly
