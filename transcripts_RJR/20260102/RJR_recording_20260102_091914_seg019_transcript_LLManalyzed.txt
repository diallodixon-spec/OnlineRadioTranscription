20260102 091914 and one that deserves commendation. Some other good news, the stolen shipping container was found, remember that shipping container that we had heard was stolen from the storage facility in Mississauga, Ontario, Canada on December 3rd, well the good news is that it has been found. The police in the York region found the container on December 19th and it has since been shipped to Jamaica on Christmas Eve. That's a good part of the news. So we want to thank those hard-working group or that hard-working group of volunteers including Mr Isaac Laird formerly of Shar Schmidt Prospect in Trelawny and that group
