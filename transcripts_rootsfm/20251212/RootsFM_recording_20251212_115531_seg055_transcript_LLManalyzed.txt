20251212 115531 Christmas time Don't have to be concerned Show some love and let the peace my friend Oh, I wish for all and kind A world to make in Christmas time Where there is no snow Where the good sense of media grows Oh, I wish that we could find true love at Christmas Don't have to be concerned, show some love and let the peace my friend Relax in all the sun and drink a red shy fear Take a puff up on me and blow the smoke in all the air And listen reggae music from the old barber here
