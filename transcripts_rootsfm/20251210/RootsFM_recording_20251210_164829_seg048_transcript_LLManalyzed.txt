============================================================

I want you to give all the words that you have to me And make sure that your coffee has it's shiver and creep Your eggs are over easy, you're destined like me All that's missing is your morning kiss that you used to greet me Now you see the Jesus To be so sweet and I can't help but to wonder if you're talking about me We used to talk It's hurting so deep I've got my pride, I will not cry But it's making me wait I'm not your superwoman I'm not the kind of girl that you can let go
