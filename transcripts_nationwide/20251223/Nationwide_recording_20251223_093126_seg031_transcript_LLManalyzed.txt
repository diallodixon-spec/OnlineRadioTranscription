20251223 093126 As I said earlier, the water situation in your area is a total different ballgame because there's no official connection for you guys in that area. So that's a different because it's not as if it's the hurricane that caused the lack of supply for you. No, it has been a long running issue from before the hurricane. So that's something your MP will have to advocate for on your behalf and deal with separately. But thank you for the call. JPS, the residents in Rosetta St. Anne, they're wondering when they'll be back up. I know they are working to restore, but they did come out to say that many will go into the new year without electricity. I don't know. I hope you're not a part of that list but it is a reality. It is a reality.
