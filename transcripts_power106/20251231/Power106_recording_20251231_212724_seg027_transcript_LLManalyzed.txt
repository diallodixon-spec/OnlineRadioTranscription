20251231 212724 I guess there's a system on working on me Now I'm just a victim of poverty Where there is life, then there's hope, they say So I know that there'll be a better day All I got to do is open the chest and pray And I know that my God will lead the way I say it's not easy on my pilgrim's journey The burden I carry is more than I can bear Why should I worry when I can't pray?
