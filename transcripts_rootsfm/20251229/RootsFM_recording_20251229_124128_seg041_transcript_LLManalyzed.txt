However, Harrison's attorney, Marcus Goff, says the police have not returned the roughly £45 of ganja that was confiscated. According to Goff, repeated attempts were made to recover the ganja, including before the hurricane, but those efforts were unsuccessful. Goff says police later indicated that a specific court order was required for the ganja to be returned, despite written confirmation that the charges were dismissed on religious grounds. He argued that the continued retention of the ganja violates his client's constitutional rights to property and freedom of religion. In a formal letter to the JCF, Gov has demanded the immediate return of the ganja and warned that legal proceedings will be filed if the matter is not resolved within seven days.
