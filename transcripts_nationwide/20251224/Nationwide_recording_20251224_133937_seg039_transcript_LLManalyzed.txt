20251224 133937 Drifting through the wind, wanting to start again Do you ever feel, this so paper thin? Like a house of cards, one blow from caving in Do you ever feel already buried deep? Six feet under screens where no one seems to hear a thing Do you know that there's still a chance for you? Cause there's a spark in you you just gotta ignite the light and let it shine just on the night like the 5th of July cause baby you're a firework come, show them what you're worth Make them go ah, ah, ah As you shoot across the sky Baby, you're firework Come on let your colors burn
