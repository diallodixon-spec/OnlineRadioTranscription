because English is the language of our former slave master the British it is not our language it's a forced language not in our DNA density yeah that's true too but let's ask a question you don't think you have English DNA seriously you don't think that you have English DNA, right?

So my friend Otele Matehari from Nigeria says in the 30 years that he's been here, he's never heard anyone pronounce his name the proper way. Neither my friend Jimmy Tindigarukayo as well as Professor Ismukumba Kawa.
