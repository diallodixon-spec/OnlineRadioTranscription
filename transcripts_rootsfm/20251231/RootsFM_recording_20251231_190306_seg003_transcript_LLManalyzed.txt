20251231 190306 When we go to different parties, the meal is late. So before you leave, just have a little sandwich or something before so you're not so hungry before you leave. So you don't skip a meal. You're not skipping a breakfast, you're not skipping a lunch. Some people want to save room for them work, I don't know. And then you overeat, try not to stick to a regular meal. So we need not to go to these functions hungry. Take your water if you need to, because sometimes you may be delayed on your journey to these events. So it's important that we are not hungry on our way to the events some persons may say oh listen man I'm gonna full my belly
