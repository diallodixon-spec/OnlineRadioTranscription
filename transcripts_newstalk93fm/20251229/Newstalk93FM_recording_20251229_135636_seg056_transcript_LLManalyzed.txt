You wanna move, you bought your bed, but you a real one. You fine as hell, you know just how to treat a woman. Yeah, I never met nobody like a you, boy. And in my heart, you are so gentle, but you still are. Baby, I love you when you make me, make me feel, yeah. But I don't want to be naive, don't want to regret. Because your love will let me know you was like the worst. Before I let you in, I got to get to know you first. My love, love, can't just give you my love. Love, love, sweat, sweat, sweat for real. Love, love. Baby girl. Can't just give me my love.
