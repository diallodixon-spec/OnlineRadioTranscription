20251223 123324 has surrendered to the authorities in St. Andrew. The suspect, 29-year-old Ricardo McCarty, otherwise called Crow, turned himself in at the Lawrence Tavern police station yesterday, accompanied by a relative. Hours later, he was transferred to the Constant Spring police station, where he remains in custody. Head of the St. Andrew North Police Division Superintendent of Police, Randy Sweeney, confirmed the surrender and welcomed the move. He again urged members of the public to the October 21st killing of Sashana Shaw and the injuring of her teenage daughter during a violent attack at their home in Rose Hill, St. Andrew. Investigators say Shaw, McCarty's former partner, was attacked with a machete outside her house and later died from her injury.
