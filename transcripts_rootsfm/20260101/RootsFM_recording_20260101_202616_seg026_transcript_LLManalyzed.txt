20260101 202616 Baby, I love you. You are my life. The happiest moments were incomplete if you weren't by my side. You're my relation, connection to the sun. If you're next to me, there's no darkness I can't overcome. You are my raindrops. I am a seed. If you and God host my sunlight, I bloom and grow so beautifully. Oh I can't do this thing called life without you Be with me, cause I'm dangerous taking love with you I'll never leave, just keep loving me The way you love, you're loving me And I know when you love me
