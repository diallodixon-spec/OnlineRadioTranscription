20251212 120606 Ministry of Health and Wellness is training 3,000 individuals in psychological first aid to help deliver emotional support to those affected by Hurricane Melissa. Chief Medical Officer CMO Dr. Jacqueline Bissessa-Mackenzie says 1,250 individuals have already been trained under the initiative. Dr. Bissessa- Mackenzie notes that the ministry is also training teachers, community leaders, guidance counselors, health care workers, members of the security forces and church groups as psychological first aid responders. What we expect also is that knowledge will translate into the next step. Where it is within communities and within families, that kind of support is provided so persons understand what it is that persons are going through and are able to pick up on certain things that they will be trained on and be trained on what it is that they are to say so that within the community and within the family we can provide support.
