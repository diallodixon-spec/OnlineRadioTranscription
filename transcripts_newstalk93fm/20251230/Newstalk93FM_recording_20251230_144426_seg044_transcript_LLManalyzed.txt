20251230 144426 I heard you calling on the megaphone You wanna see me all alone As legend has it, you are quite the pyro You like the match to watch it blow And if you'd never come for me I might have drowned in melancholy I swore my loyalty to me, myself, and I Right before you lit my sky up All that time I sat alone in my tower You were just haunting your powers Now I can see it all They wanna know you took me out of my grave And saved my heart from the fate of Ophelia
