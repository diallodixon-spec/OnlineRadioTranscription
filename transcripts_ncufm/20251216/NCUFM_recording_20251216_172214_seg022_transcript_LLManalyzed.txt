20251216 172214 I don't need you to get tired now. I need those of you that want to help us stand up and we're gonna give God glory. We praise God. He has a name that's above every name. So the song just simply says this. I call you holy. Your name is holy. You are so holy to me. Somebody say, I call you holy, your name is holy. Holy you are, and holy you are. Come on, I want you to raise your voice all throughout this room. Let the world hear you, let the world catch up. I call you holy said, I call you holy.
