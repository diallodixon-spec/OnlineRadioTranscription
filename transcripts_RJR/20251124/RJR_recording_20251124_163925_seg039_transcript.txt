We don't have a mistletoe, we don't have no snow or ice. What do we have with Jamaican Christmas? And Lord, the Christmas breeze, I blow. Can you feel it? Christmas breeze, Christmas breeze I blow. Hear me now, I want to put a new time this Christmas. I want to hear you feelin' it. I want to put the time this Christmas. For in the heart of Jesus' name, let angels cross straight forth. Bring forth the royal diadem And crown him, crown him Crown him, crown him
