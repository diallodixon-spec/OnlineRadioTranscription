20251218 161310 I just want you to come and bite it up Just a little winding up Come and meet me behind the truck and we rev it up Whole day, keep throwing it back at the way you stop Baby, no way We could post up all the pictures you want When you're ready I go over here, darling You go over there But we could meet in the middle and start a bacchanal Play in the middle, hey What we gonna do now? You know, I want your company. And it's nothing too risky Limited liability Don't worry If you try all the things I like You could still be shy in the morning So don't feel away
