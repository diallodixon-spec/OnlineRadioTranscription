I'm gonna make this here. I'm gonna win this year. I feel it. And if you're not see the progress, don't you come near. So focused this year. I'm going to get my share. Progress, progress, progress, progress. We in Australia. And I do want something God to give. Oh, Lord, bless the life I live. Bless the life I live, ah, ah, ah. Something's got to give, oh, God. Bless the life. Bless the life, bless the life, the life I give.
