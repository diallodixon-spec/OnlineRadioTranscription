20260101 141810 I also want to send a happy birthday greetings to Jadani Boucher, a young lady from the Seaford Seventh-day Adventist Church. May God continue to bless her and to grant her a long and happy life as she continues to serve the Lord. I wish her a great celebration as she celebrates another milestone in her life. May God bless and prosper her. And as she attends school, may the Holy Spirit guide her into all the truths that she needs to know in school. May he help her to accept the good and reject the bad as she go forward. Have a great celebration today. God bless you. Greetings from Elder Forsyte and the C-47 Day at the Dischurch.
