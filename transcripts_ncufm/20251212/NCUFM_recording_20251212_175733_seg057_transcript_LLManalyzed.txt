20251212 175733 There's a man in Georgia He's fortunate he is He springs down at the coffee shop Don't see his pain Or lonely tears He has some children somewhere So he lingers by the phone. He's afraid of dying, but he's more afraid of dying. Who would be the one to let him know Someone needs to tell them Someone needs to share Show them life eternal And Jesus loving care
