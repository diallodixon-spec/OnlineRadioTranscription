20251226 145024 I will sing and shout When I get there Hallelujah When I get there Now hear this, I'm gonna ring out those heavenly bells When I get there. Now hear this, I'm gonna ring out those heavenly bells. When I get there. I'm gonna ring up those heavenly bells, when I get there, my summer's really over, and heaven and joys come over.
