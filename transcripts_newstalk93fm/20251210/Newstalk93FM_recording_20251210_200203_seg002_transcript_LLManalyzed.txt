============================================================

With one wine, baby. With you, I want to dance the night away. One jam, turn a lifetime, baby. So don't feel away. You don't like the fast life. They look on the bright side, girl. I go take the blame. I just want you to come and bite it up Just a little winding up Come and meet me behind the truck and we rev it up Whole day Keep throwing it back, I know why you stop Baby, no way We could post up all the pictures you want When you're ready I go over here, darling You go over there. But we compete in the middle and start a bacchanal. Play in the middle, hey. What we gonna do now? Jam to a rhythm in the heat. I got evil up in the heat. Hey, what we go do now? Start a wine on it. I say compromise on it, baby.
