It's never changing, can't you hear me? I'm saying I want you for the rest of my life. Together forever and ever too fast. Together forever we do. And don't you know I would move heaven and earth to be together forever with you we started dancing and love put us into a groove as soon as we started to move the music played while our bodies displayed through the dance then love picked us up for romance
