They're not playing good songs as much as the slackness. They're fighting against blackness. They're toxic. They're glorifying their grave and taxes. Watch this. The wicked don't want to come here and share. They want that had the flesh, the one feel bite and tear. Why are they so unfair? The man ask and it's done. And it's done too. The more the wicked, the more reggae spread. Let my teeth on cigarette. One love is more than reggae flesh. No deeper reggae dead. Burn house reggae dead. The more the wickets on reggae dead. More reggae then. The more reggae spread, the more reggae spread. Burn on reggae red. Don't fight to be the reggae head. Get them on clean and now we're the reggae men. All over the world, reggae music rotate. Pure positive vibes.
