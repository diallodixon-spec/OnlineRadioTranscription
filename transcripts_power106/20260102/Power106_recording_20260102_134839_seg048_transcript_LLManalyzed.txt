20260102 134839 that lost the election supported the issue in their manifesto while the winners were silent on that issue. Quite true, Scott, quite true. And that's the point I make. We can, yes, sure, we want food on our table and we want to increase wages and whatever, whatever. Those things are part of why we vote. But that's the same anywhere in the world. So we have to have these other issues that should be important to us and vote on those rather than just the popularity of somebody who have sweet mouth etc. We need to vote on issues not just hardcore issues about putting food on the table and you know our pocketbooks making sure that our taxes are such that we have enough money in our pocket but we have to vote on other social issues as well they need to be just as important and I'm afraid that's not the case
