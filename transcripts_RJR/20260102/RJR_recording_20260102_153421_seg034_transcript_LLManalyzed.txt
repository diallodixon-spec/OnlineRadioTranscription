It's interesting poetry because I know some people who they'll write poetry or poems and they'll keep them in their books. They won't expose anyone to them. And then there's another set, you know, another type of poet who decides, okay, I've written these, you know, lovely things down and I want people to, I want to share it. I want people to hear it, you know, and they'll go and perform it. Did you start, did you start writing and skipping them to yourself or you decided the minute you wrote your poetry, you wanted the world to hear them? Yeah, for me me it was a bit of a gradual transition from exploring writing for personal, I would just say no, personal consumption and then eventually keep towing into sharing with family
