20251219 130204 This was a lonely online. It's my testimony. Told so much that I wasn't worth it. I even tried love, but then love hurt me. Ah, you've been there. Come on! Shouted, but the God never heard me. I began to beat the mind. Let me talk to you. I see everybody go through the fight. But not everyone comes out with hope I started lowly but took me high He gets the praise and the world will know I will live and I die I will win with tears in my eyes I'll be judged and criticized Only by those who are free to try I'm living it for seeds and favor So you gotta change, don't trade for something greater for me
