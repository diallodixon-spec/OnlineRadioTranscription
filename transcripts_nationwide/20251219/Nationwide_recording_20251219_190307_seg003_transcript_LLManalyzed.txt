So I think that's also a caution that we need to be aware of how fast is as soon as possible, but I certainly think that once things start to happen in the US, you can treat it as saying that it's on the mark and we're on the get set position, that we should get ready and try to make sure that our whole order and we will look for opportunities as to where and what we can do. Certainly, if we don't address the issues that are on the ground, you know, these things will test and create problems in the overall industry. So I would say that I don't know that I am in a position to say when, but from what is there and what the different news media people are banned saying three months, six months, but nothing is definitive. It just says as fast as possible. But as soon as that is happening, then I would imagine that things will be happening fast.
