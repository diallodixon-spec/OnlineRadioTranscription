20251224 202614 It's a love we could never ever compare. Feelings just a mobile whisper in my ears. A true lover you are real to tear. Pay no attention to the name of love's tears. Work we are work now for days and days. Love is like a bubble up the atmosphere. Double, double, double, little sheets spread tear. Never had it like this, Lord, I'm losing my spirit This I love with the life I ever come to This I love is physically B.A.B., this I love is spiritually B.A., me I go love it internationally
