============================================================

I hope we never get tired. And I never have to go to work. No one knocking on the door. Disrespecting will no not say it, but she needs tenderness for your life. When I look in your eyes, baby, I see clear as a morning sun. I got to take some more time off and give you extra fun. And I know you like it. I hope we never get tired. And I never have to go to work.
