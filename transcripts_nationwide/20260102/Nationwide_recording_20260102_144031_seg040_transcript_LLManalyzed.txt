20260102 144031 What you waiting for, sounds a bit cold I can't do this by myself Without you, there ain't no place for me to hide Without you, there's no way I can see you tonight I'd look for a little bit of peace and quiet Without you, I can't keep sippin' in a black dream There is no more you and I need you to set me free I took the page out of your favorite book You sold me lies just by the way you look, boo Taught me a language that I never speak Baby, that ain't for me, that, that ain't from me I dug my grave, I checked where you moved You took me higher than I ever flew
