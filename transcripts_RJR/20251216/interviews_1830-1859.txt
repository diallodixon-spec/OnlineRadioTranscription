National Chorale Brings Hope and Unity through Music in Post-Hurricane Jamaica

In the aftermath of Hurricane Melissa, the National Chorale of Jamaica is set to bring hope and unity to the island through their upcoming concert, "Caroling". The event, which is free to the public, aims to uplift the spirits of Jamaicans and provide a sense of community and solidarity. According to Kerri-Ann Palmer, Programs Outreach Manager at the Institute of Jamaica, "It's an opportunity for us to contribute to the Hurricane Melissa relief, bringing hope, life, light, and love to persons who are not necessarily feeling the Christmas vibe as it is right now."

Herbie Miller, Curator at the Jamaica Music Museum, emphasized the importance of using music to bring people together and build hope. "We don't utilize culture sufficiently, music in particular, to bring our people together, to use it to build hope," he said. Miller also highlighted the National Chorale's unique ability to blend European and Afro-Jamaican sensibilities, making their music a true representation of Jamaican culture.

The concert, which will feature a range of traditional and modern Christmas carols with a Jamaican twist, promises to be an unforgettable experience. As Miller noted, "The National Chorale is poised to do it, because to begin with, they bring your Christmas with a lilt, a sort of our own voice, our own way of expressing ourselves." The event will also include a sing-along, allowing the audience to participate and become a part of the experience.

In a time of need, the National Chorale's concert is a beacon of hope and unity for the people of Jamaica. As Palmer said, "It's just a wonderful thing to have them in the space, unified and enjoying the spirit of Christmas." The concert will take place on Thursday, December 18th, at the Institute of Jamaica's Lecture Hall, and donations will be accepted to support the Hurricane Melissa relief efforts.
