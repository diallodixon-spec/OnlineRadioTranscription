20251223 200103 We'll let this place go down in flames only one more time You'll kill the lights, they'll draw the blinds Don't throw the sparkle in your eyes I know that we were made to break so what? Don't mind I'm gonna stay the night Are you gonna stay the night, you're gonna, you're gonna Stay the sun, when it starts to snow Only know you love her when you let her go Only know you can hide when you're feeling low Only ain't the road when you're missing home Only know you love the way you let her go
