Keep on working on it, keep on working on it. Work it on it, live all your sweet, sweet love in me. Keep working on it, live it, work it on me? Work it on me You're all you sweet sweet lovin' on me When we go to work How the days seem so long The only thing to think about Can we do wig at home. Cause we got a way of talking, and it's better than words. It's the strangest kind of relationship, but at least it always works, yeah.
