I'm the butterfly When I look into your eyes I wanna fly But I don't got no wings to fly Do you know where your faith is? Do you know where you love is? Do you think you lost it somewhere? Did you get it coming? I'm the man that you've been looking for I'm the man to put when you love me so Baby, look around, look around and tell me what you see, girl
