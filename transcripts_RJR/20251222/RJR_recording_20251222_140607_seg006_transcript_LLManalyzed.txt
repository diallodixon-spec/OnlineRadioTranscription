20251222 140607 This is the time to shine, start the fire within. Now watch the nights where they may make. No fuller chat, but we still a step. One thing you know, we're blessed and we're sure. We not make them try to bring we don't know. We shine bright, we rise up like the sun, glow, glow, glow. We not make them try flipping, we don't know. We shine bright, we raise up like the sun go.
