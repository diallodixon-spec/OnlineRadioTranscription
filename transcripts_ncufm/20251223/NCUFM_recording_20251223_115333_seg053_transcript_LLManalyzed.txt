20251223 115333 us back from bondage, the bondage of sin. It's a love that takes us away from the shame and the pain and even takes away the desire to sin. And it's so difficult for us, Father, to overcome sin when we enjoy it so much. There are things that each of us enjoy, all of us like to do, and we know we shouldn't. We know that it doesn't please you, we know that it does not make you smile. We know it doesn't reflect your character. But we do it anyway. And we enjoy doing it. But I'm asking you to take away that desire. Remove the lust of the world. Our pride. Remove our self-righteousness and help us to focus on you. Help us to put our minds into your Word. Apply our hearts to your Word so that we can be filled with your Spirit. And once we're filled with your Spirit, then we will not even be interested in sinning.
