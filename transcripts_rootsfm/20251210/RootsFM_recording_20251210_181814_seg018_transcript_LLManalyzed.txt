living the blue nile whence it pours smoke of the nile some call it this epitome of nature's halido casting a halo like stratus over lotic spirits rolling to the delta from the Aksumite kingdom Ethiopia you shall welcome me home I am a homeward bound.

The Ark of the Covenant constitutes the Solomonic high levity which manifests the Christ's righteous blest on the terrestrial plain. Ethiopia!
