20251222 204943 I'm losing control, giving me more than I need. Everything where you got it for party, even if what I got in me, baby. Nothing to device you, my old reggae. My ready, my blues. My activity, all the things from Monday to Sunday. Say you be my ghost. I see you, and I have everything I go do for my baby. My ready my blues, my activity, all the thing from Monday to Sunday, say you be my ghost, yeah. And I have you do. Everything my baby, everything my blues come through. Now you be my person, a person. Forget each other, I need blessing. Other guys, you don't teach me lesson.
