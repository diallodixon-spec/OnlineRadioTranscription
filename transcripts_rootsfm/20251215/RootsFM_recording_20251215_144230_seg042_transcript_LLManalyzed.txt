20251215 144230 I was young, just dreaming, you know, see. They pull up in a beam, I sweep her off her feet. Believe me, when I speak, it's real how I explain. When I met your girl, this feeling was the same. Couldn't get you out my brain, can't get you out of my heart. So come and be my partner, my every part I thought. My days are really past, my mind is just a race, but them couldn't take your place. You don't look on your face, tell whoever up on your case. Too late for the dinner too. Take the lunch from them plate and the dinner too. New dawn, new day, looking to see the view. Feel like should stop there if I have a chance to do it again. Why not? Why not?
