20251223 165640 I would wait till the end of time for you and do it again. It's true. Don't you know? Because I can't measure my love. There's nothing to compare it to But I want you to know that if I could fly I'd pick you up, I'd take you into the night And show you love what I've never seen, I've ever seen. I'm ready. Love you.
