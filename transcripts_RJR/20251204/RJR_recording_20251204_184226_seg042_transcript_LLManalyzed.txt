We talked to my producer who asked you to come back and we have questions coming in from all my listeners as well. We're talking to Tasha Watson. She's a Jamaican math teacher now teaching in New York and absolutely loving this interview. So make sure you stay with us and remember our WhatsApp line 5535908 soon come. Thank you so much for staying with us. We continue with you on Beyond the Headlines. I'm Dionne Jackson-Millow and we're continuing our special.

And well, just before I read some of these comments, let me let you finish your point, Mrs. Watson, because you were talking to us before the break about the fact that you had this class of athletes that people hadn't expected would be able to do well or to pass math and so the school I guess wasn't expecting to sign them up and you thought they should sit CSEC
