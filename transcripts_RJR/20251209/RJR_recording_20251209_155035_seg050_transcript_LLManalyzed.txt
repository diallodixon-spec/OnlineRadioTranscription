So how are you trying to pivot? How are you trying to ensure that even though we've just been hit, what are you doing in this space to make sure that you still can at least make some sales, you know, try to see that this season can work for you? Yeah, well, luckily, some I had stuck from before the storm that was not damaged. So I'm really grateful for that. So I'm able to still go to some of the craft fairs that I had planned to from before the storm with the undamaged stock. And then I'm trying to see how I can maybe create pieces that don't require me to use some of the equipment that was destroyed in the interim before I can replace them, the equipment. So that's kind of what I'm trying to do right now, you know, but it's hard as well mentally to be creative when you've just gone through a traumatic event.
