20251215 094738 and we are taking your calls if you have any questions immigration related questions for the United States or Canada then you can give us a call the numbers to call 8 7 6 6 3 0 9 3 7 1 that goes up to 4 and the 6 1 8 6 7 3 0 still seeing some questions coming in on the YouTube chat just to follow up on that question previously about renewing a Canadian visa for the retirees the person followed up to say they are not visiting a child they're just going to Canada as tourists. Okay so then they would need to show their ties to Jamaica and again if you're visiting someone in Canada yes you can get an invitation letter from the person or if you're staying at an Airbnb you would show the cost of your accommodation and that of course you have enough funds to cover the cost for your accommodation and airline tickets and so on. Okay good.
