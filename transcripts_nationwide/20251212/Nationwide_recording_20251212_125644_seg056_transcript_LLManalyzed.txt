2025-12-12 13:25:18 have started the task of looking at how we're going to re-engineer and the type of pipe, the size of pipe to include in the restoration the future demand that we have on books. So just not to replace but also to increase to meet the future demand. So the distribution of the buckets of clean water, sanitary buckets out of the water and notice people leaving with their buckets. How is that process going across the way? We have a very high demand, more than anticipated to be honest, but we're trying our best to distribute today and we'll be distributing at the Santa Cruz office as well and in various communities across St. Elizabeth and even Manchester, Westmoreland and overall St. James, Trelawny and St. Anne. And so for persons who may have come and you see that you had about a hundred here today right? About a hundred. Right and if they don't get in today can you just turn up to the office? What do they need to do? They just turn up?
