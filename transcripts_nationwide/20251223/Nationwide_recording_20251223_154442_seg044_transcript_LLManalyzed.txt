20251223 154442 I woulda liked one of these mornings to wake up and find your face on a field of lion right next to mine I woulda cut through the party in the smoking and the rum and bust a extra wine I'm liquid every time I fantasize me see your lips me see your eyes I left the road where I hypnotized for you it's just a thing just another little fling but for me this is heaven, and the angels, they must sing it's a pity You already have a wife And missing you like crazy Missing you, oh girl Baby, you're L-O-V-E by O-U L-O-Z-E, I love you
