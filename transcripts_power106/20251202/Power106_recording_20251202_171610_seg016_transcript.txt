daily. Mr. Jones said some communities are generating far more waste than usual, in some cases increasing from one truckload to as many as eight. One of the things that we encourage persons to do is to ensure that you separate the storm waste, so it means the tree curtains, the zinc, the board and the bulky waste, etc. Separate it from the residential waste because that makes it easier for compactors to come in. So rats typically, they'll hide under the zinc or they'll probably hide under the board, but they feed on what is produced in the household waste. We're encouraging persons to just ensure that they continue to bag their waste until you get there. Ensure that you separate from the bulky waste because whenever our teams call, they have to spend an additional time and kick through the bulk waste or separate the bulk waste for you.
