============================================================

they say the holy water's watered down and this town's lost its faith our colors will fade eventually so if our time is running out day after day we'll make the mundane our masterpiece oh my my oh my my love i take one look at you you're taking me out of the ordinary. I want you laying me down to the dead and buried. On the edge of your knife, stay in trunk of your vine. The angels up in the clouds are gentle.
