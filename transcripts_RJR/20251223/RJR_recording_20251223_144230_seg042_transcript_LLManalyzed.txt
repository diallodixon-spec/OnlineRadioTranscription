20251223 144230 I came back and then I took a trip down to the country and I want to say that really inspired. A couple days after I went home I wrote a song and I was saying I want to sing this and I said you know what, I'm going to sing this one. And even in writing it, it became bigger than just the devastation, it became a life thing, a life lesson. So in mid-January definitely the sun will shine again coming out with me playing and singing. you get greater performance is the more you understand the instrument that you have and how you can make it work so everything you get a bread in you get something go do it and everything are gonna be the big stage show can you go up there and care manage if they need the steps to that of course not true yeah
