I am strong enough. I know to pull my own weight. And I love China. I know to hold my faith. Well, let me tell you something, miss, you tell them the next time around. We read between the lines, we overstand certain. Some man and a fish, we can't swim. And so them left way for drown. Like the sun, the next morning we rebound. Pretend that's paradise. No for them no nice. Would a never day a any how them have a choice If you want survive and stay alive The fantastic plastic smile you have to recognize Oh I will never go dancing In no enemy zone where they are aiming at I will never go blinding I've been around long enough I know when it's a danger place
