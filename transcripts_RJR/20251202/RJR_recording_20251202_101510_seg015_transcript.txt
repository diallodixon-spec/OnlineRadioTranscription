You know that when you become ill and you're not able to function, that will also affect your adherence. You may interrupt your routine in taking your medication. And so that is another point that we want to make clear that during this time, it is so important that you do everything to stick to your routine of following the doctor's instruction, taking your medication so that you can avoid having to be hospitalized, avoid becoming ill and not being your very best, given all the challenges that we have to be facing at this time. Absolutely. Well, I want to thank you so much,. Michelle Douglas-Shaw, Clinical Pharmacist at the Malibu Regional Drug Service, and also want to thank Mr. Andre Taylor, Chief Pharmacist at Union Square Drug Service Natural Health Fund, for joining us on Healthy Interest, and of course, thank you for Extended State, so you could get this important information out.
