2025-12-12 11:22:33 What a song to take us out this evening. I worship you. Thank you Drive Time family for tuning in. And Forbes. Hopefully you enjoyed today's show. Apart from Texas, I'll see you checking out. Hopefully it was a good show for you. Seeing Sister Marcia first lady says she's getting home from her grandson's PTA. All right, wonderful. That's right, shortened edition of another drive tomorrow, Marcia. Auntie Sharon, blessings. Shirley Anne, thank you very much.
