Like, I'd be honest, it was one of my most humbling experiences. You know, as an artist, enough times, you go out there and you want a boop boop boop, you want to mash up the show. And I just went out there and I just sang and I just kind of embraced what was happening because there was so much respect for what we do. You know so that was lovely and then from there I went to New York for the Caribbean Music Awards that was awesome it was so much fun because not only was I there obviously as a nominee but then they asked me to co-host the BET livestream red carpet
