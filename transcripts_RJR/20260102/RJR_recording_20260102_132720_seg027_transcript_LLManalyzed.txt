That's really, that's happening still. Listen, young people, especially here in Jamaica, we're not going. We don't have the resources. Yeah. We don't. Listen, we don't have the resource. Yeah, we don't. For you guys to be calling and pranking Fire Brigade. We don't have it. So parents, just tell your children, no matter what that, please.
