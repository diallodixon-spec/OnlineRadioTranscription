government minister Desmond McKenzie has expressed disappointment with what he called the poor quality of work done to construct the Savannah Lamar Infirmary in Westmoreland. The infirmary, which was only recently constructed, suffered significant damage during the passage of Hurricane Melissa. During a visit to the infirmary this week, Mr. McKenzie said the municipal authorities and the ministry's technical team should be held accountable but the work was not done.
