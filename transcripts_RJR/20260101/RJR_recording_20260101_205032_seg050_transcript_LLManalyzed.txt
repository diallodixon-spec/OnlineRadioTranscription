When the road is hollow I'll be standing taller To face the darkest and the hardest of times We'll be taking care of all the children thereof But if it's required we'll be on the front line You can call me by my name I am ready to roll Once the rules remain the same, all the stories been told. But any time, never stop out. Liarness is on the rise, don't you ever up down. Never say never will.
