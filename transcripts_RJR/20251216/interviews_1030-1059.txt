JPS Director of Corporate Communications Winsome Callum Discusses Recent Bill Increase and Restoration Efforts

In a recent interview on Radio Jamaica's Hotline program, Winsome Callum, Director of Corporate Communications at the Jamaica Public Service Company Limited (JPS), addressed the recent announcement of a 7% increase in bills. Callum explained that the increase is due to the higher cost of fuel and the unavailability of renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar power, following Hurricane Melissa.

Callum stated, "The reality is that when you have an event of this nature, there are certain things that happen that could cause the fuel charge on bills to go up. And that's what we are actually seeing." She emphasized that the increase is not a permanent one, but rather a reflection of the fluctuating cost of fuel, which can change from month to month.

The JPS Director also highlighted the company's efforts to mitigate the impact of the increase on customers, including working with partners to partially offset the costs. "Had the company decided to pass through all of the costs that were incurred during this time, it would have been a much more significant increase on customer bills," Callum noted.

In addition to discussing the bill increase, Callum provided an update on the restoration efforts following Hurricane Melissa. She reported that 84% of JPS customers have had their electricity restored, with the company working to rebuild and repair the grid. Callum acknowledged that while the pace of restoration may seem slow to some, it is actually quite good considering the severity of the hurricane.

Callum also emphasized the importance of partnerships in the restoration efforts, including the arrival of 67 line workers from North America to assist with the process. She expressed appreciation for the support of the regulator and other stakeholders, saying, "We're working every single day to bring on more people onto the grid."

The interview concluded with Callum reassuring customers that JPS is committed to expediting the restoration process and getting power back to those affected as quickly and safely as possible. She encouraged customers to be patient and to remember that the company is working tirelessly to rebuild and restore the grid.
