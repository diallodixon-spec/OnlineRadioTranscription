It's like a textbook guide really. And so it's a go-to. And I guess programs like this and the fact that you're highlighting the results with equal prominence, you know, because back in the days when this actually happened, then, I mean, it went out there. And so a certain impression was formed. So it's important that now that there's a reversal and there's a position adopted, that that is also given equal prominence. All right. Going to leave it there. Appreciate you both. Thank you so much for your time and your thoughts. All right. Attorney-at-law Nigel Jones represented CVM in this defamation case brought by councilors or former councils, Michael Troup and Sylvain Reid and Gary Allen, RGR Glena Communications Group Senior Executive. Let's go for the break. When we come back, schools as shelters soon come.
