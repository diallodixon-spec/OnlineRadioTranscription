20260101 190705 You heard me and put tears on my face And even now when I hate you, it pains me to say I know I'll be there at the end of the day I don't wanna be without you, babe I don't want a broken heart Don't wanna take a breath without you, baby I don't wanna play that break without you, babe. I don't wanna play that part. I know that I love you. But let me just say, I don't wanna love you in no kind of way. No, no. I don't want a broken heart. And I don't wanna be play the broken-hearted girl. No, no, no broken-hearted girl, no broken hearted girl.
