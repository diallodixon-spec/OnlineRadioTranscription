20251219 094127 Elizabeth Taylor, tell me for real. Do you think it's forever? Been number one, but I never had two. And I can't have fun if I can't have you. Me, I, and why? Hollywood hates me. Hollywood's hot as your last hit. Been number one, But I never had two, And I can't Have fun if I can't have you. All my white diamonds, and there's a big deal, forever. And the paper's on the screen, and in the minds, all my white diamonds and lovers are forever. Don't you ever end up anything but more. So long untouched, bone dry, not a plant can grow. About time I get back.
