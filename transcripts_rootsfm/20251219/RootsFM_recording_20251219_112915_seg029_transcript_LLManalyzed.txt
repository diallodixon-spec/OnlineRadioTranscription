So is it that you do now at this time mainly pop-ups or you have a space where people can actually get your things? Are you online? We're online. So we're on Instagram at Country Girl Classics. And usually we have our products at the Kingston Creative Hub. We would need to stop up, but next year you can find us there. And we'll usually at the Art Walk Festival as well. We took a little break, but we're back December and we should be back next year. But you can just check out our Instagram page.
