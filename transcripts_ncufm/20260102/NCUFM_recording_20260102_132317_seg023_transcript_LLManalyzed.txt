20260102 132317 from the very beginning this life that I'm living was part of your plan all along so I don't thank my lucky stars cause that's not where my blessings are Nor they come from the father's heart Not the sky, not chance, but truth is I'm not lucky in love Yeah, I'm unlucky enough. I'm unlucky enough, baby. Oh, yes, Jesus loves me.
