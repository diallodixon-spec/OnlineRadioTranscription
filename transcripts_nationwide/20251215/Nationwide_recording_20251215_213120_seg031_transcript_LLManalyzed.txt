20251215 213120 For somebody like me, come and now follow my lead I may be crazy, don't mind me, safe boy Let's not talk too much, discovering something brand new I'm in love your body Come and move that in my direction She thankful for that, it's such a pleasure Turn every situation into heaven, yeah Oh, oh, you are My sunrise on the darkest day Got me feeling some kinda way Make me wanna savor every moment, slowly, slowly You fit me, tell her, may love how you put it on
