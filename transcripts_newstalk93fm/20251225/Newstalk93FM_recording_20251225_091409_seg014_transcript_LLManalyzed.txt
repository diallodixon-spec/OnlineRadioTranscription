20251225 091409 We all need love Jump up and show me love, raise up and show me Love Together, say we all need Love Jump up, show me Love, raise up, and show me Love Sucker makes we shun up together No place that I'd rather be Shun up together Right now is our energy Shun up together Sucker is our partner We shun up together I tell you so much of my mind that I can't sleep. I'm stressing all the time. I can't sleep because I'm always on the grind. My body's not keep up. People can't follow me my whole week. Take your troubles and throw them all away. Get ready to run across the stage. Get ready. Get ready. Give me energy. Real energy. I tell you so we all need love
