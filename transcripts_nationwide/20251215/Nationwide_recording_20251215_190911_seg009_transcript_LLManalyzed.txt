20251215 190911 Not actually watching them, there's a difference. They were aware of them. I mean, is there questions from you on that this morning? Well, look, I think ASIO do a terrific job with the resources they've got available to them, and they could do a lot more if they had more resources, of course. But I do have to wonder how an individual is able to go and train, acquire the necessary weapons, plan and undertake an attack of this nature, and for, as it's been reported, to have flags of a certain nature in their vehicle. It does speak to me of something a lot more sinister, and that concerns me. Is there a feeling though, and Malcolm Turnbull I think touched on this yesterday when he was asked about it, is there a feeling that you just can't watch everybody? You know, someone, if they have this twisted ideology, and you pointed this to one of your early answers, they're going to do it anyway and not everyone can be watched. So it's difficult for the authorities to actually track everyone. Yeah, and look, that is a fair assessment. They can't watch everybody.
