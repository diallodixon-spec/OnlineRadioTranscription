20251217 210306 Seasons change, but our love stays the same. This is our spot. Our love is like summer time. Healing my mind, our love like summer time. Ooh, feels so cool to me. This is a fact. Our love is like summer. You are hot like summer. Warm my heart, I don't need no other. I love spending time with you like the sunlight. You see me through, it's a holiday when we love this way.
