20260101 101409 Have you ever happened to me yet? Oh baby, so I can be forever I'll take what I can get Cause baby you're the best thing that's ever happened to me yet. Take good care of me. Cause my heart's a tender thing. Oh, oh, oh, oh. Take, take it out on me. Cause the heart of so much pain And could never, ever learn it again So take, take a little more time You've got my heart in your hands this time
