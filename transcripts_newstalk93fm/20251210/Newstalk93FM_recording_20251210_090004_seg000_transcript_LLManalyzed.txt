This is Ira Glass. On This American Life, we tell stories about when things change. Like for this guy David, whose entire life took a sharp, unexpected, and very unpleasant turn. And it did take me a while to realize that it's basically because the monkey pressed the button. That's right, because the monkey Pressed the Button. Surprising stories every week, wherever you get your podcasts. Live from NPR News in Washington, I'm Corva Coleman. The Norwegian Nobel Committee is presenting this year's Peace Prize to Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado. Machado has been living and hiding, and Venezuela has imposed a travel ban on her. So her daughter is accepting the award on her mother's behalf. The chair of the Norwegian Nobel Committee, Jørgen Vatne Fridnes, says Machado is coming to Norway. Although she will not be able to reach this ceremony and today's events, we are profoundly happy to confirm that she is safe and that she will be with us here in Oslo.
