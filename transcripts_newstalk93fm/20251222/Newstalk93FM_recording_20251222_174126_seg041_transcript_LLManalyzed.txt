And you don't try to stop me vibe, so don't say You do what you want, I do what I like You ain't have to get no shit, cause when it comes to party, I ain't such a man And I know when we come to party, we don't have a plan You don't tell me, why don't I want you to go. Why not who you like, baby? We do it with me. You're sick. So when you're ready, you do it. Why not follow your heart and never why not follow who I like, yeah? And it's your kid, so why not everybody inside, yeah? Like yourself, like yourself, like yourself until the party comes to an end.
