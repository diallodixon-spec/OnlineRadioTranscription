20251230 135532 baby scales, infusion pumps, and a pediatric larynx scope is expected to strengthen the hospital's capacity to deliver safe, quality care to newborns and pediatric patients across Western Jamaica. Public Relations Officer for the Hummingbird's Association, Sharon Persa Cooper, says the donation is in keeping with the 47-year-old organization's long-standing commitment to public health care in Jamaica. And so we're donating here today to the pediatric department. We were advised by the Ministry of Health that there is a focus in Jamaica on improving pediatric health care quality. And so we asked for a needs list.
