So we have another situation of great governance where you have two people getting a salary to do one job. Mr. Barnett's contract, I'm told, expires next year and the relevant authorities, i.e. the Ministry of Water, Environment and Climate Change are simply waiting for the expiration of that contract to not renew it and say goodbye. I'm also understanding if they try to do anything else in that regard, they're likely to face a hefty lawsuit from Mr. Barnett, which would probably cost them more than it is to continue paying him. With relation to SSL, I'll try and find out more about that because there's been few questions, there's been few articles or media reports in relation to SSL.
