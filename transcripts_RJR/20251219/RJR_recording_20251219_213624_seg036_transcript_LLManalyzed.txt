Roll in, roll in with your friend them. Hot body girl them, me defend them. Overseas currency we a spend them. No wars in no shot, no no special wheeler. Play back a big tune then. Make it people them, catch it and smooth them. Who don't know this we a go school them. Watch how the whole place a rock right now.
