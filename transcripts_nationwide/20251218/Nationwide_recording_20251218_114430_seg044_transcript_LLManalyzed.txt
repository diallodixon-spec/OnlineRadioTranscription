20251218 114430 I am a culture man. Before starting the company, I would have been traveling, doing a lot of corporate events, events like this nature that we're at this morning, performing, dub poetry. So that's how I started again, started performing from school, high school. So that's where that skill was honed. Excelsior? Excelsior High School, that's where it started for me. You got a good education? I did, sir. A very solid one. I'm a'm a proud former head boy of Excelsior High School. Oh, you were a former head boy too? Yes, yes, yes, yes. Oh, I didn't see you're a top a top. No, I don't ever top a top more than you, but, you know, once again anymore. Yeah. Um, you know, so I did five years at Excelsior. I don't know if you did sixth form at Excelsior, sixth form when you were there. I did, uh, come college. Come college. So, so there was no sixth form when I was there, so I had to go to sixth form at Woolmore's Boys. And then I was deputed by Woolmore's Boys as well in my short time there. So those were my two high schools. The business.
