It's like a hymn get dominated, watch the grammy side of me That's how much people can you say Would feed you when you hungry, when your brother miss you with money But I have been so fortunate Surrounded by so many people, make sure said me gone pathetic And everything me can't forget Your daughter and me daughter wants me even she no happy friend If I ever make it in a lawy If I go be zippy like royalty So me happy zippy in a lawy Like royalty, royalty, hey, what up? Manna set it like G-A-Card Remember when me get me first under a card Fart, else I clap, so pattern it did record Say the word, me first, did record All of your sisters reap it, they reward Got me first, did I remember when me used to start?
