20251222 125029 George and the family from Melbourne. George, Australia, all the very best to you and the team at Big 94 for the holiday season. And thus, with Miss Joyce and her comment of being on the right track. By the time you read this, I will be over the hill with sleep. So George isn't here with us. George is all the way in Australia. It does take time to listen and to send comments. But of course, you know, he can't stay through the course of the program or he'll never get any sleep. Thank you, George. Appreciate that. Let's pick up another one. Let's see. This one says, thank you very much for relaying the message to JPS on our behalf. We truly appreciate your assistance as our electricity was restored the same day and the damaged light wire was also removed that same day. Your prompt support made a big difference for us. Thank you for giving us the feedback and of course to JPS for responding in a timely manner and in the way they did.
