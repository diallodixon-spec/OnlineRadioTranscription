20251229 141312 We did down full style, strictly up full vibes I pick it up when the bills them, the rent and the mortgage due When me chalice, when your best friends are gone and it's only you Like up a splittin' up the music For every pain there's a melody For every, there's a harmony That brings everything together So make us sing together And who said life not order? And every money got this joker I beg you to end it with love
