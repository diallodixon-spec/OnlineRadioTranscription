Dr. Christopher Tilfton, Minister of Health and Wellness. The incidence of bush and garbage fires on the increase in the western section of the island. Assistant Commissioner in Charge of the Jamaica Fire Brigades Area 4, Rudolf Set are in a surge in bushfires, and especially garbage fires. Melissa resulted in a lot of trees and shrubs being totally scorched, and so this year we have seen a lot of fires. Normally we have the dry season which starts in the latter part of November, but then from the 4th week of November this year, we realized that we have been getting a lot of bushfires and we are getting a lot of garbage fires also. And that is right across the parishes of St. Elizabeth, Westmoreland and St. James. And over to a lesser extent.
