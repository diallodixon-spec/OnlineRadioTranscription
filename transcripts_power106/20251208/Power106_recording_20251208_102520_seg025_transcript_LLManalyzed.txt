Of course, the administration wants lower rates, but you have to be careful what you ask for, because you know the short-term rate, inflation is still above the target level, then you know, the long end will naturally adjust higher, because if you have the inflation, the risk associated with it, and you also have to pay attention to the Bank of Japan and what they do as well, in terms of their hike, then you might very well see funds flowing outside of the US, which could put some pressure on yields and upside. And as a result of that, you might see rates moving higher, not something that the administration would like to see.
