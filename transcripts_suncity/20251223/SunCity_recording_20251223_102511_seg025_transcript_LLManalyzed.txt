20251223 102511 be mean to your children, but we're saying have them understand the value of what you're doing and understanding that in the real world, nobody never. It won't be like this. There'll be no handout. No handout. Look, the world has changed and we too as parents, we need to be blamed. When my daughter started going to primary school, I recall the first couple of mornings, I would put her on a bus to take her own bus and I would slowly drive behind that bus to make sure that she get to school without her knowing that I'm trailing her to go to school. Yes. Fast forward to now, her brother who is younger, right? The thing changed with the mother said, boy, we can't put him on a bus, you know, like we charter one of them little buses to pick you up, pick up kids in the mornings, right? So, that child grew up and I'm serious as God, I'm very serious. That child grew up and now he's 20 years old and don't know what bus goes anywhere. He knows zero as it relates to public transport.
