I don't know what happened but I think he's getting worse as the days go by because they have never done that before all these years that i have known him and i think he needs medication but there's no family member right now in jamaica to assist him but i think he's going through a lot and he's doing things that that he's not supposed to be doing he's taking up rubbish now that I never used to see him doing those stuff. Old toilet, bicycle room, things like that. So something it is getting worse and worse as the days goes by. I think he's badly in need of help.
