We are truly the better station, of course, by choice, owned and operated by the Mustard Seat Communities, headquarters at One More All Drive, Kingston, 11 Jamaica. After the lunch break, my dearest Adira will be moving along aisles, you know what I'm talking about, from left to right, and of course you're gonna be interacting with a few people, not only from the community, but also out of the community. My youngest, talented, when I talk about looks, she got it. Tammy, woo. Social media personnel. One of the youngest and the finest. And don't ask me why I say that. Let me just play this one back again. Don't question my intelligence.
