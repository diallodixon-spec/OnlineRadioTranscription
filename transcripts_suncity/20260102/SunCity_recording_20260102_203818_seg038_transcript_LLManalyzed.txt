20260102 203818 So I give them hell, call me mystic. Lips for the gang of trash. Riskless now, cause I made a gang of cash. Life's bland, still freaks with the durang. Slang, spit, gang, chain, speak, they do that. Watch they mouths drop, watch the crowds pop up. Right there, with the school face, smash on and knock out. Chain, gang, or me, I run the game. If I gotta keep it greedy, so be it, I'm supposed to stay. Fizzy raws ain't messing with my memory. Wanna hustling shit, check what I've been through. Got minds took it from you, and they can slot minds exact to my own shit, dawgs. I'm only dot com. 30 minutes of continuous female music. Question, tell me, when will you grow me? I'm having gummies and I've got my own room. I'm living in a celly when I'm feeling lonely. When it's all over, please get up and leave.
