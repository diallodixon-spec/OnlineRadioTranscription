20251225 145347 No game. You gotta get something. You gotta give something. You gotta do something. You gotta go through something. Be a cook in the kitchen, a lady in the street. You can't show your teeth to every guy you meet. It's all right to be a little sweet. Or be a model with the kids, and you know where to go. No pain, no pain, no gain. See you can't give up, cause times get hard. It's just that old devil trying to keep us apart. Say devil, you ain't got nothing here. I'm holding to my man and he has no fear. No pain, no pain, no pain.
