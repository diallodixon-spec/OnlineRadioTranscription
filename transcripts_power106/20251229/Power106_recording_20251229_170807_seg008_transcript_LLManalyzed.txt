20251229 170807 fraud-related charges against a former SSL employee, Genean Panton, in February of that year. Head of the constabulary financial unit, Inspector Brenton Williams, says what followed next was the meticulous gathering of key evidence. He says notwithstanding the public's impatience to have the matter brought to a close, the process cannot be overstated. The alleged fraud was long-standing and sophisticated. Probing it required a comprehensive review of events dating back to SSL's inception in 2006, including careful analysis of investor activity and how funds moved across the entire period. Work of this nature takes time and must be done diligently. We understand the public's expectation for swift results and that delays can be viewed negatively. However, the JCF, the FID and our law enforcement partners, including MoCA, have the capacity and expertise to conduct these investigations.
