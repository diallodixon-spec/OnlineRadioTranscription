And Ms. Ruth Ann Lawrence, thanks again, a digital and youth consultant at Power Her Move services. Thank you so much. And we cannot forget our students, Nicania Brown-Patrick and Raim Hall from UE and Ashay Baker from CMU. And course this conversation would not be possible without Alaska Serials Curves, the Ministry of Health and Wellness Youth Services Unit, Wendy's Hamtastic Holiday and the Council of Community Colleges of Jamaica. So stay tuned Jamaica and remember and remember your digital footprint is permanent. So make it powerful and make it purposeful. Up next is more music and good vibes here on Sun City 104.9 FM. All day, every day, I listen to Sun City Radio.
