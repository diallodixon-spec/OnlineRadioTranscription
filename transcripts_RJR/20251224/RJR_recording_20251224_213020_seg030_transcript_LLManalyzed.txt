20251224 213020 Nice Jamaica! For those stepping in from the cold, heading outside the airport, I say yes man, I dare you to say no. Welcome! For those heading in from No Man's Land International Airport, good to have you back for Christmas 2025. If you're stepping out of a Sankster's inside a Montego Bay, it'll help in the colleagues as well. Thank you, sir
