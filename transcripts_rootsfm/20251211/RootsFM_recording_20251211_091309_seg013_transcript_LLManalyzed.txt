RIP RIP RIP! You reach to your eyes can see so me preach when mommy diamonds really Got speed me a burn up the street The dark frees cause I never believe Me not bleed but them cutters no yield Me no show a emotion, me no talk how me feel Me never fumble the bag yet when me go for the cheese And if a nothing we hard member we do this with these Pressure coffee spit Boy we not take talk them drunk off the sweep
