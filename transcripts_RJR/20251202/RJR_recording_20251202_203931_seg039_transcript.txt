So you might not get full function back. However, however, here's what's interesting with the brain, especially if you start the process early enough is that the brain has the ability to create new pathways. What does that mean? It means that especially in a newborn is like you have a road that you would normally drive to go to a certain destination and the younger the baby is is the more roads that the baby has that can get to the same destination. It's like the baby can open up new roads where he didn't know a road could be and create a new road that gets you there. It might take a little longer but at at least it will get you to the same destination. So, and this is why when a baby is learning a new language, if you drop them in Jamaica when they're one year old, they're going to start to pick up the rhythm of the language, the accent of the language, and all these things.
