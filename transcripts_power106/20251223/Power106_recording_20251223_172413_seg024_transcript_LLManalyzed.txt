20251223 172413 But I know the discussion has been good with the Mayor of Kingston and the CEO as well as other stakeholders in how we operate. So we will get that leeway, but we are saying to our members, please, for heaven's sake, just do the right thing on our own. Don't block up your eyes. Especially, and I must make mention of certain streets. Duke Street, Duke Street, Upper Duke Street, King Street, Orange Street, places like those. Just park properly, get your pickup, and move on. Because the taxi don't park at one spot for more than four or five minutes. When you're doing that, especially at stop lights on King Street, don't block it up. If you do so, then the police will have its way to either pick up your vehicle or provide you with some tickets. And they can be blamed for doing that. But once you stop, pick up right, then they will allow you to stop to pick up your passengers.
