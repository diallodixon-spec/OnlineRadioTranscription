You know, I found out, yeah, a long time ago that you have to name it and claim it, you know. You can't just say it's a beautiful day. You have to confirm it so you can earn it. Yeah, man. And say it out loud and say it out clear and be intentional about it. So, you know, you wake up in the morning, you might feel kind of down and out, but listen, man and say it out loud and say it out clear and be intentional about it So, you know you wake up in the morning. You might feel kind of down and out. But listen, man Name it and claim it Jermaine Edwards.
