20251218 142621 Come forward Cheyenne, come take your props. Good afternoon Cheyenne, how you do? I'm good Altia, how are you? I'm in excellent shape because of you Cheyenne. So thank you so very much. The farmers are drawn from a number of parishes, St. Anne, St. Catherine, St. Andrew. And St. Andrew, Kingstown and St. Andrew. How were you able to pull them together like this? You know we have a good rapport with RADA and GES so we get them from them. Okay and of course these are farmers that continue to support your any initiative that you have because of the work that you have done with them over the year. Which is correct yeah and tomorrow tomorrow will also be the Minister of Agricultural Farmers Market so the same one will be there tomorrow. Which is why we had to have ours today, because the ministry is having theirs tomorrow, so we first them. Yes, I agree with you. Alright, so you also have products on sale today. Tell me what you have. So we have just only one pumpkin leaf.
