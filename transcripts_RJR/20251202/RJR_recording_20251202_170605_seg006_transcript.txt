and Prime Minister Holness today accused the parliamentary opposition of sowing division and seeking to discredit the government over the distribution of relief aid to residents in ravaged communities. This follows accusations from the parliamentary opposition that their MPs, whose constituencies were destroyed in the storm, have been left out of the process to distribute government relief to their constituents. Speaking in parliament this afternoon, Dr. Holness instead accused the opposition of distributing aid in a biased fashion in constituencies controlled by their MPs. Dr. Holness also dismissed growing allegations of bias and mismanagement on the part of government agencies in the distribution of relief aid to needy residents.
