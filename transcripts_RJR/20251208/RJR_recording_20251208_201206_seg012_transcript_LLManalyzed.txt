============================================================

I'll be able to share with the world this love that you've given the day that you were risen. To reach it soon, everyone's got their opinion. Practice what you preach. Be careful what you teach. Don't be hasty in your judgment today. Seek guidance from above. He'll surely want to love you. If God is for us, who can be against us? I know, I know we'll live forever. And God on our side True love will abide Will abide forever If God is for us Who can be against us?
