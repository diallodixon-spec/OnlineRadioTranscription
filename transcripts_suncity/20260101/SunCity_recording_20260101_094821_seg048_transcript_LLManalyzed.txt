20260101 094821 I never knew when you stayed and said I'm telling you You, you, you imagine nothing so new There's nothing love can make you do when love takes all of you You can have the purest talk and the funnest attitude But I swear that don't mean nothing When your heart's under the spell If you ever spin your mind around that careful self I'm telling you love makes things happen You never know where it's coming from. You never know who you're gonna love. You never know what you're gonna do. You'll never true love take so long.
