20251224 203828 And at one school in particular, one of my co-workers here, her son attends one of those schools, that some of the students were locked out. That may not agree, pan. Instead of lock out somebody, when I lock out them outside, I definitely don't agree to that at all. I do think that you guys should have them on the campus, on the compound, maybe in the auditorium, whatever the case is, you contact their parents. You understand me? Because some of them have nowhere to to go. Some of them parents are going to school, some of them don't have the key for going to their yard. When you basically do that, you're setting them up now to go get in a problem. So that I don't agree with, but I agree with rules and rules are rules. So back to my coworker with the child at the school, you know, like seventh graders, they had about, apparently from from July until Monday about 10 meetings with the principal and she would say oh guys you guys can wear clocks but it can't be suede clocks you guys can wear this and I can wear that and I can wear this right and everybody agreed and then Monday first day of school you're better on suede
