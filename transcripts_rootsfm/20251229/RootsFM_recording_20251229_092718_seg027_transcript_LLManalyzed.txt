Now that I roll with Dre, everybody show me love. When you sell like Eminem, you get plenty of groupie love. Look, homie, ain't nothing change. Roll down, G's up. I see exhibit in the cutting, man. If you watch how I move, you mistake before I play up here. Been hit with a few, but I don't walk with a limp. In the hood, in the letters saying 50, you hot? They like me. I want them to love me like they love me. But I live in New York for sure. I tell y'all I'm local. And the plan is to put the rap game in the trunk for a focus match. Money on my mind. Come on, y'all. I had a scene in America.
