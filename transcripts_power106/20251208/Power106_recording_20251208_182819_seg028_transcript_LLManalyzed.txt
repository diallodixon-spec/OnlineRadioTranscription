============================================================

now and what we've always said is make my job difficult, make our jobs difficult as a coaching staff in terms of who those 23 players are and so we're going to have a whole lot of time with them prior to the match but we'll be monitoring them and checking in on them and having conversations where needed to make sure that they know what the task is but areas in which we can see them improve, even in their club environments. And I'm really pleased that even when we have those conversations with them, they ask from us sometimes in terms of things that we see that they're doing in their club environments, and that's not to give them, tell them to do something different from what they do in their club, it It's just to kind of reinforce them with things that are similar and to kind of encourage them to raise the bar even higher. Of course, the current squad you have, you are happy with the squad in terms of the cover that each player would have going into this very important fixture.
