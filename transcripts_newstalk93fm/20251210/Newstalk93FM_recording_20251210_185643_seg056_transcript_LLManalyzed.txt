Check it to the max, but did you please turn up the bass to the max? Please just rewind, let me check it to the max. Don't have to fear, number one in command. I came just to make two militants. They won't figure it out, but I don't need a mask. So they love how I rewind, I make true religions. You dealing of course Or you dealing with your boss If we break up then you know that it's a loss Upgraded every dude I ever toss So they want me back you can't touch this Baby I already leveled up You're looking for love and I'm looking for the love Baby you can't handle all this sauce
