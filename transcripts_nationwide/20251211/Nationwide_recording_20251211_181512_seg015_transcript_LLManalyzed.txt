Moving forward, I think, you know, these situations have to be thoroughly invested more, but I still give credit to Michael Johnson for attempting to do this.

I am not here to jump on the bandwagon and bash anybody because, like I said, we did receive 50% of our money. I want to look at the glasses half-fold and half-empty.
