Baby, baby, baby, baby Won't you mean so much to me? Now it's gonna take some workin' But I believe in you As long as your intentions are good First thing Monday morning I'm gonna paint my tears away Got no cause to look back I'm looking for me a better day See the thing about love is that it's not enough It's the only thing that brings you this pain
