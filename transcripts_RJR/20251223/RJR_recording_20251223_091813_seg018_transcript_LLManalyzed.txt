20251223 091813 Welcome to Hotline, this is Clive Mullins. Hello, morning. Sir Clive, good morning. Welcome, how are you doing, what's up? Compliments are this year, sir. And the same to you. Yeah, Mr. Mullins, I got a present yesterday, not monetary or gift, it was one of the greatest presents I've ever received. Yeah, what's that? Yeah, let me tell you something. I have some problem with, you know you know, the supermarket have a value price when you cash them out to find number and then you can exchange the points them for Christmas. Okay. Yes. Okay. Right. Well, I have one in crossroads in a Spanish store, but I didn't have a pass number password and then I didn't know that basically the change the formula from um in May, right? So I went to cash my points and then they didn't have any information so I went to Crossroads, right? And there's a lady named Miss Melvin. Apparently she's the manager.
