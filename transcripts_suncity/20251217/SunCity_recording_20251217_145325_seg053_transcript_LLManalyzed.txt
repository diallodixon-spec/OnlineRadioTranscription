And when the going get tough, I say the tough get going. My people don't give up. I say there aint no giving in. No. Just a far right guy that you're not from the beginning. A lot of youths in life say they can't take the pressure no more. But from your trust in the most high life, I go get better and be sure. The youth juggle on the roadside, Babylon says we take up your body.
