We out, hold me, let us shine together us shine together You can have me anytime wherever say the right words and I will give you pleasure and in the end no other love can measure Do you really love me? Because baby, I love you. I love you. Take your pain. Tell me what it's going to be. Am I going to be your one and only? Are you going to try to play and use me? Never try to listen, even knowing it's me.
