He is for toys, for little girls and boys Around the world, where'er they be He'll find them joyfully M is for manger, the place where he was born S is for angels angels who watched from dusk till dawn S is for star that led three men from afar And remembering these we hope you'll see A very merry Christmas wherever you may be Have yourselves a very Merry Christmas
