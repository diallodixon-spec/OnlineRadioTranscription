But I couldn't find my own place Caught a phallic shout Cause I got too wild But now that's how I'm getting paid Cause I'm she on stage I'm done hiding Now I'm shining Like I'm born to be We dreaming hard We came so far, I believe We're going up, up, up, it's our moment You know together we're glowing Gonna be, gonna be golden Up, up, up with our voices No one can change us so often Gonna be gonna be, I'm done hiding, now I'm shining like a butterfly Oh, our time, no fears, no lies, as who we're born to be
