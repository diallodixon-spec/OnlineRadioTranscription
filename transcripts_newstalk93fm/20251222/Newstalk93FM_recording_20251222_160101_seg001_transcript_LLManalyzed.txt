20251222 160101 You're listening to Sleek Radio, 93 FM. I love the way that you bring a vibe With your hands them up in the sky Rollin' back and havin' a time We ain't lying again And we haven't one little spin Yes, we jammin' down to the end. See me with me cannibal friend. Lord, me cannibal friend, I wish you come from there. London, I wish you'd come from there. New York, I wish you would come from there. When you come in, my baby, I wish you'll come from there.
