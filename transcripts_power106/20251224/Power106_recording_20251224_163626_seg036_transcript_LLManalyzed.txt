There are so many who still have that spirit of moving ahead with life, rolling with the punches, dancing through the raindrops, getting up after being knocked down. There are some people who are determined to have Christmas, regardless of whatever their present situation is. That's the spirit. That is the spirit. Definitely understanding that you yourself do have a role to play in bringing that joy and good time to your own life. That's the Spirit.
