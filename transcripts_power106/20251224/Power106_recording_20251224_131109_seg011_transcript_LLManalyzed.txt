The $16,000 where people are getting now, no value of $10,000 three or four years ago. So nobody not coming with their foolishness then. This $16,000 has no value now. Where you can buy with $16,000, where you could buy with a $16,000. All right, you know say also me when we buy the my purse also may buy in a pot more as 16,000 I made me bite for water for those are selling for seven thousand dollar them time there so some man coming if foolish about minimum
