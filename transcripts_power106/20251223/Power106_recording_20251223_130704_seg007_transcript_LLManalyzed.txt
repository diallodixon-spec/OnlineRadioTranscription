Still, these people are like one of the poorest nations in the world. For real? It's not trickling down to the people sir right right and the united states is one of the richest it's one of the top 10 economies in the world in terms of size it is the largest economy in the world and black people in the united states have to make the same income as jamaicans the second poorest country in the Western Hemisphere, income per capita. Mr. Black people, sir, I think you're wrong. I think you should just Google it. Hold on. Hold on. You should just Google what I've just said to you. Just Google it.
