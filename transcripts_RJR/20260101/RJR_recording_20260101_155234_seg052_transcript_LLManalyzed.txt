Well, we started a production company earlier with Ranchy, you know, from us to play a tiff with that. We have one or two little tune, but never really the major hit, you know? Because, you know, funds kind of rush on, you know? So when we thought about the label, you know, Robbie said, like when you have the tax label, you can use it, and we have to check a man called the cool ruler, Gregor Isaac. So when we check Gregor's man, Gregor said, yeah, man. So Gregor come in and Gregor did six songs, you know. And we play all the six songs the same then Friday morning, Gregor will reach the suitor before, we, you know, revise, you know, and revise everything now one day, you know. The six songs? Yeah, man. So, go and get that one tight, man, you know. If you want anything written for playing, I'm not worried. From the end of the screen, send the tape, I'll come over and just play it.
