20251217 153928 Forgive me, it sounds cocky Hypnotize me and open my eyes Redwood tree, it ain't hard to see His love was the key that opened my skies Girls, I don't need to catch the bouquet To know a hard rock is on the way And baby, I did have been a little superstitious The curse on me was broken by your magic wand Seems to me that you and me, we make our own love New hype, manhood. I ain't got a knock on wood. All of them miss how we stand.
