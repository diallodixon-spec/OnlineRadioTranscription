20251225 214830 I'll go from London, Ontario, down to Montego Bay Or fly Toronto to Kingston to take a little break And though I'm used to the weather, Canadian all the way I want to fly to Jamaica to spend the holidays Snow is Laying out on the beach while catching some rays Slip flops on your feet, ain't no need for a sleigh It's so lovely, got vibes all the way It's so lovely where the palm trees sway It's so lovely best place to get away Ain't nothing like Christmas in a J.A.
