20251223 131816 I'm standing here looking in the mirror Saying damn to myself I should have known the day would come That she would find somebody else And all the things I took her through And I shouldn't have lasted this long Never make this telephone call into our own Cause we don't wanna stay up It ain't nothing you can do about it It's like running out of love No matter what you say
