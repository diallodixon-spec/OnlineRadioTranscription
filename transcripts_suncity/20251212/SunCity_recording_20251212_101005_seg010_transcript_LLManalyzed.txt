20251212 101005 Hell, hugging on my mama from a jail cell. And who'd think in elementary, hey, I see the penitentiary one day. Running from the police, that's right. Mama cast me, put a woofer to my backside. And even as a crack fiend, mama, you always was a black queen. Mama, I finally understand for a woman, it ain't easy trying to raise a man You always was committed A poor single mother on welfare Tell me how you did There's no way I can pay you back But the plan is to show you that I understand There ain't nobody tell us it was fair No love for my daddy cause the coward wasn't there
