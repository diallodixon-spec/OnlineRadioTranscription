============================================================

No greater gift than the gift of love No greater joy than having you with me I'm so happy the holidays find us together No other place I'd rather be My wish for Christmas is having you here with me my wish for Christmas spending time with you my wish for Christmas as I was supposed to be My wish for Christmas is making dreams come true You're prettier than all the decorations That is also true Your smile is brighter than the stars More special than a special occasion
