20251225 194429 I stand with you. I remain committed to a Jamaica where our infrastructure is stronger, the system is fairer, and every community is safer. We will continue to push for a recovery that reaches everyone, no matter where they live. My family and I send warm Christmas greetings to all Jamaicans at home and across the diaspora. We wish you a season of joy and comfort with moments of true connection. May this Christmas bring peace and understanding in every home and may we all carry the spirit of unity and hope into the new year. So walk good and stay safe. Merry Christmas Jamaica. The proceeding was a Christmas Day message from Leader of the Opposition Mark Golding.
