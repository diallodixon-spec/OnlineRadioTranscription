Tracy? Hey, girl, what's up? So hold on. Why you look so vexed this early? Deena just talked. Lisa, it is so good to see you. But sorry you catch me like this, girl. My uncle sent me one barrel and when my family go for clarity, you don't want to hear the price of the people they put on the something. But matters worse, me hear say half of the thing they missing, and me know say a custom. Girl, how you know say a customs? Lisa, stop going like you're not having a sense, man. You know say everybody everybody talk about it in the media? You don't want me to stop listening to you, sir? You ever experience that? Customs don't go into your package, suitcase, barrel or cargo unless you worship the item or the agent stand up right there when they inspect it.
