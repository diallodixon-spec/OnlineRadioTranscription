20251225 143221 communities across Jamaica as they rebuild and move forward after Hurricane Melissa committed to providing reliable solutions that support homes and businesses. Season's greetings from Garrett Trading and my brother, Mior, from Manly Meadows. I'd like to send a shout out to all the staff of Radio Jamaica. Wishing everyone God's blessings on this day. Thank you so much my brother Muir. All the best to you too and the family.
