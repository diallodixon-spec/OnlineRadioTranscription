I'm going to make a hole in the bottom of the bottle. I'm going to put a bottle of feel whole. Whenever I'm lonely, you're there for my soul. Wherever you are, girl, that's where I call my own. Whenever you doubt it, I'll be letting you know. Oh, girl, I want to be dancing with you forever. You see through the storm and take me as I am. Baby, it's magic anytime that we're together. I'll make her just love you and hold you for my hand. Hold you for my hand, my hand.
