While we were coasting around the bend Checking on some friends we know We said, come let's go to a go-go So we took a stroll out on the bank Found the hottest pot there's around Then we start to check it through the sound Round we round me down, we chop me down When we break them down Oh, reggae down, Babylon Reggae down, Babylon, reggae down apartheid Reggae down, apartheid system. Jimmy Cliff.
