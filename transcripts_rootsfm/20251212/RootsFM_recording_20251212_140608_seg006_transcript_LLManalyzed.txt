I am one boat when I don't see no girl go dive. I don't charge the barge, no, I don't kiss pipe. Dance, we a dance, don't kill the vibes. We ever up like when the sun a rise. When we touch the road, every girl a go make nice. We a shell the place, the evil just mean nice. Oh my God! You better believe it! This dance is spinning! Stir right, stir right, stir right!
