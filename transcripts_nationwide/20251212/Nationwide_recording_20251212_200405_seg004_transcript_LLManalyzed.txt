This is the A-Team Radio Show, your on-air study program. And we are just going to get right into it. And as we are winding down the academic term this semester, we know that persons are gearing up for the holidays. But just before the holidays, we still have some work to do.

We had part one last week and I did say to you that we'll come back with part two for this weekend. So we have with us again this evening Mrs. Janelle
