20251212 101507 I remember Marvin Gaye used to sing to me He had me feelin' like black was the thing to be And suddenly the kettle didn't seem so tough And though we had it rough, we always had enough I'd flip off about my curfew and broke the rules Run with the local crew and had a smoker too I realized realized mama really paid the price. She nearly gave her life to raise new rights. And all I had to give her was my fight dream. An hour off the mic and make it to the fight screen. I'm trying to make a dollar out of 15 cents. It's hard to be legit. It's still failure written in the end. It seems I'm heading for the bend. I tried to find my friends, but they're blowing in the wind. Last night, my body lost its whole family. It's gonna take the man in me to conquer this insanity. It seems the rain'll never let up. I try to keep my head up and still keep from getting wetter. You know it's funny when it rains and pours and they got money for water.
