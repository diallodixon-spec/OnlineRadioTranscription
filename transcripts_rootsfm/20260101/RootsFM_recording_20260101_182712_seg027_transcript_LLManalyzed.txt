20260101 182712 Don't forget me, I beg Oh, I remember you said Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead Nothing compares, no worries or cares Regrets and mistakes, they're memories made Who would have known how bitter and sweet this would taste Never mind, I'll find someone like you I wish nothing but the best for you Don't forget me, I'll pay, I'll remember what you said Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead
