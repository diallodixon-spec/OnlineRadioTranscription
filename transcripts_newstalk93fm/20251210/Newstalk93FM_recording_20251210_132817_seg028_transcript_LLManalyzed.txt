============================================================

Oh, my life, I'll do you. Breathe it, take my breath away. At your altar, I will pray. You're the sculptor, I'm the clay. Oh, my, my, you're taking me out of the ordinary. I want you laying me down till we're dead and buried. On the edge of your night Staying drunk on your vibe The angels up in the clouds Are jealous now that we've found So this world is ordinary You've got me kissing the ground The saints you've heard Chatter me when you're done Oh Lord, return me to dust The angels up in clouds Are jealous, know what we've found. Something so heavenly, higher than ecstasy. Whenever you're next to me, oh mama.
