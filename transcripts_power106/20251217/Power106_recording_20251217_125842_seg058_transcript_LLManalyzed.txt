20251217 125842 these days because man is love of of themselves these days but let me tell you I believe by faith people is going to come together because I think this is a miracle to some people what happened recently with this lady so people is going to try them best to heal the land and to do better and and I think that would be good but I am saying to the community members please don't throw the garbage on the sidewalks put it into a drum or something and wait until the truck turns up you put it out because else rat going to cut our throat in this country. How can you throw in garbage and sidewalk? Who's going to pick it up? Why can't you put it in
