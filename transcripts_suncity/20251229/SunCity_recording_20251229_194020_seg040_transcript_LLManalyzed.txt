20251229 194020 I see you driving round town with the girl I love, and I like forget you. I guess the change in my pocket wasn't enough. I like forget you and forget her too. Said if I was richer, I'd still be wedger. Ain't that some shh? Ain't that so shh? And although that's praise in my chest, I can't afford a Ferrari. But that don't mean I can't get you there. I guess he's an Xbox, and I'm more of a T Atari. But the way you play your game ain't fair. I'm pitching a boo that falls in love with you. Oops, she's an old man. Well, just don't you she know. Ooh, I've got some news for you.
