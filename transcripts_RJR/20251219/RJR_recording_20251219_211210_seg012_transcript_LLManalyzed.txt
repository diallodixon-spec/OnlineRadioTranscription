Oh, thank you very much. And to all the crew. No respect. Alright, sir. Alright, that's singing Bird, 12 minutes past 9 on the 94. We go right back into the music on the E-Factor show. It's almost holiday time, so you know we gotta keep the vibe going, right? I'm a big deal, you're my friend and my big deal. Yeah, we're kind of important, for real. Boy, yeah, I'm big deal.
