None of we don faith I feel I'm impacted Telling the world I want the money better Weed seed's above but it's a waste of time Can't give him pick, need him no rescue No boy can give him a strap or a locket If I don't want it, we don't want it yet Weed seed is above but we are unfit to throw them a waste of time Badum, badum, weed seed till death We are broke like no grief and we are here to your knees Straight money we are free We go see your bill of pride signed niggas knee, if we get rich we walk and we rely for that. Wheatseeds spread old money, old like figary. New money in the ready and we consider we. Work hard, bring me money, give thanks in a fee, so we know it's any one of the funds we will have, so that faith from faith will be in our hands.
