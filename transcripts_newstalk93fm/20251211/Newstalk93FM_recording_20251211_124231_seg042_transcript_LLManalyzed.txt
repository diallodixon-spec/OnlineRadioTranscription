============================================================

I know better, it not easy Time testing but I'm strong With love on my mind, love in my thoughts carrying on Why nobody no believe, in a love again Because every love that lost, not believe You're not God again Seems our faith is lost Nobody not believe And it hurts my heart Turn the lights on the world so dark Still I believe That love is everlasting Yes I know love is everlasting i believe love is everlasting i know, love is everlasting
