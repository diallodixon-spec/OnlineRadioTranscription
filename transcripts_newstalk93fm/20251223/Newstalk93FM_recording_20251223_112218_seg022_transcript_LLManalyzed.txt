20251223 112218 I'll run this love is tough just let me know Deep as the blue sea, deep as the blue sea Love me really, actually And even though the storms will come No, we won't run, just love me Deep as the blue seas Nice and easy, so deeply We submerge under this emotion Like an anchor, you keep me safe I'm not afraid of the ocean I'll keep you warm cosy You'll be coming on me arms When the storms approaching So, wipe on it When all of us think like the titanic The lighthouse we are where I fall in Deep as the blue sea Your love's flowing into me And even though the waves are rough, this love is tough. Just love me. Deep as the blue sea, deep as the blue sea. Love me really and truly. And even though the storms will come, no, we won't run. Just love me, deep as blue sea. Wherever the wind may carry us.
