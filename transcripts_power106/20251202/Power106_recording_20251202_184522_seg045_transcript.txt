You know, we don't want them to just leave school to carry them through school and then some because of other entrances may go the wrong direction. But we feel that if we take mentors, assign them to a kid from an early age that works with them, committed to working with them, you know, continue communication, you know, in person, remote, you know, giving them advice around what other things they can do to counter the other influences that are facing them now. And we believe that that will make a major difference in what they do when they leave school or they try themselves even throughout school into the social network, into their communities, and even influence others in their communities by what experience they are getting from the mentorship program.
