20251216 190305 I am resting in your presence, Lord, you come for me. Come for me. No, I mean, I know your timing. I know you won't forget. You have given me your head. And you never failed me yet. Oh. Get up to me. Get under me. Let your promises come to pass. Let your promise come to pass. Be us and be. Be unto me. I need you. Your pain will come. Your pain will be letting in my life. I believe in your promise, Lord I believe. I am resting in your presence, Lord. For you comfort me. You comfort me.
