Be weak and do wrong, or be strong and do right. And I don't want to keep going to church, singing all about how much you're worth. And then continue doing my dirt dirt living as if I didn't care if you're hurt cuz if it's God that I'm after I just can't serve to master and before something happens I gotta turn it all around because I know I can't just have my cake and eat it too Cause it's really easy to stay on the fence and still do you It'd be cool if we could love the Lord and still go through our thing
