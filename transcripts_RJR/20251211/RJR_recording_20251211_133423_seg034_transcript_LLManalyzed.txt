I don't need no dreams when I'm by your side Every moment takes me to paradise Darling, let me hold you I'll warm you in my arms and melt your fears away Show you All the magic that a perfect love can make I need your love again so baby be mine Baby you gotta be mine And girl I gave you all I got to give So baby be mine girl And we can share this ecstasy As long as we believe in love
