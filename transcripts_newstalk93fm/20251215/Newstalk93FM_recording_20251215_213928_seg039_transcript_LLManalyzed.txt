20251215 213928 So many things where they trouble my mind One of you where they make me wake up early Me ain't no one make whoever break up early Me don't need no other girl to chase up nana Me know all these new emotions Many feelings that help us to love Show your friends don't go laughing now If I say me got your arm Tell me how you feel it baby, no pretend If not, no make you tell me now I'm walking on you there but smile you. I just need one girl with a lawyer. You know, same me. I go straight to the lawyer. He do me like shy.
