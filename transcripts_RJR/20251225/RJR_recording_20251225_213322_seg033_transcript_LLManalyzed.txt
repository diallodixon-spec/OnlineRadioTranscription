20251225 213322 There's no winter time There's a sweet sunshine At Christmas, Jamaican style Lots of rain in mid-December Grape red flowers, sweetly blue A true Jamaican Christmas greeting I extend to you Just come on over, there is room Jogging, shopping or just dancing On the beach or checking out a show In Jamaica it is fine to go fishing all the time It's lots more fun than fishing in the snow. In the West, in the West, every Christmas is a time for all to smile.
