20251219 185134 set up when the next set of games will be played, Wolves will be at Molyneux after a 2-1 defeat to Liverpool. When they are improving Wolves, probably Brentford, the visitors of course, Brentford, I think Brentford should be, but I think that what Wolves did was a one-off. I think Brentford will be good enough for the points here and probably will keep a clean sheet at two goals nearly. All right now here is another picture now. At 10 o'clock tomorrow Manchester City may be taking West Ham of course close to the bottom of the table. Now this West, this Manchester City, the team may in fact have fit, but to the consternation of my wife, to be honest, that has been her team for as long as we have been married. That's a lot of years.
