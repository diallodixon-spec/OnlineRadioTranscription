20251231 211411 I mean like as I'm listening I'm like so it was just awesome just being there and I will say that that award show is about to I don't even know I don't it's about to blow up because for the first time if you think about it in a long time there's one event an award show that honors the music coming out of this region I don't want to say Jamaica but this reason so like for example, Michelle Montana performed that night and and they honored a few soccer artists like Sherwin Winchester Winchester is his last name. So I said that to say we don't have to wait for the Grammys to give us nothing. We don't wait for the billboard to charters. We don't have to Wait for the rest of the world because guess what? Everybody comes here to take a chunk of our culture and put it into what they're doing and so i love that there's a higher level way of us honoring our own we don't have a way for other people you know so for me to have been there and seen what was going on because this award show has been going on for three years and see that wow yeah
