We fly We fly That style where you give me the top head Roll your bumper, just push it further Bubble up, sit down and drive like a learner You do the thing so me never get hurt One time, just bubble down there Two time, just bubble right there For the last time, girl, we are doing it over and over We call that a slow ride Just keep it, just keep it, just get it Right now, it is my time girl, we are doing it over and over. We call that a slow wine. Just keep it, just keep it. Right now, it is my time. It is my time, girl. Don't tell me to join in. Oh, no, no, no. All I want is waistline. Yeah, man. Right now.
