20251215 171511 I love the way that you bring a vibe With your hands them up in the sky Falling down and up in the time Wine in season again And we have the money to spend And we jammin' down to the end Rolling with me cannibal friend Lord, me cannibal friend Friend, friend, friend, friend Mmm me cannibal friend friend friend friend Who are you? Lord me cannibal friend, friend friend, friend Yeah, yeah Lord me cannibal, friend Until we meet up again Mmm everything on site, you know Mmm the bag gone packed, you, you know. She dreamin' to take a ride on me, cause she comin' down to please. When she ram a chair, she push it back, all the bambam rollin'. And she savin' some for me. I tellin' you, I love whenever you bring a vibe.
