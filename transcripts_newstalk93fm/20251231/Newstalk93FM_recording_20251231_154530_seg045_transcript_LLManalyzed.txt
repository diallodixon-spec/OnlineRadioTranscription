Guess you done and I get it Said you stand, you wanted my name and you left So I'm guessing that you never meant it Said you trying hard on cause the loot was so strong Now I'm standing alone in this kitchen Singing sad songs but I'm knowing that this don't last long If you leaving then leave cause your bags gone
