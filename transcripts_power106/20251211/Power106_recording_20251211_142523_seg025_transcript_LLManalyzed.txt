storm, which slammed into Jamaica on October 28, made landfall on the Western Belt, left much of the housing stock in tatters as it ripped off roofing and toppled houses, even as floodwaters poured into dwelling places, resulting in residents having to flee for their lives.

Several shelters have already reverted to regular use as residents made alternative arrangements. But among the questions raised during last week's sitting of the Public Administration and Appropriations Committee, PAAC was for continuous updates on the number of residents still being housed. ODPEM Director General Commander Alvin Gale revealed that, as expected, Westmoreland, where the hurricane made landfall, has the largest number of residents.
