20251223 173731 Good afternoon, good afternoon to you. Thank you so much for joining us here on Nationwide at Five. It's time for the cover story. My name is Ricardo Brooks. And I'm Siobhan Campbell. Are you the Siobhan? Doing alright. Yeah, you good? It's almost Christmas, getting better and better. In the cover story this afternoon, if only the technology would cooperate with me, I could tell you what's in the cover story this afternoon. Okay, here we go. In the cover story, this afternoon, the year in review. As the year 2025 draws to a close, we're reviewing the work done in several ministries, and this afternoon, we're turning to works. The minister with responsibility for this area joins us now, Robert Nestor Morgan. Good afternoon, minister. Hi, good evening to you and good evening, sister. All right, thank you so much for joining us. Let me start by getting an update on where we are in terms of clearing all the roads that were affected by Hurricane Melissa.
