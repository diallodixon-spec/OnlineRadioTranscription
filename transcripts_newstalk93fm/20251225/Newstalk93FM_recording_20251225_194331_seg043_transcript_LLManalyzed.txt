With you, I want to dance the night away One jam, ten a lifetime, baby So don't feel away You don't like the fast life You look on the bright side, girl I go take the blame I just want you to come and light it up Just a little winding up Come and meet me behind the truck and we rev it up All day, keep throwing it back, I know why you stop Baby, no way we could post up all the pictures you want when you're ready
