20251231 164725 Thank you for an unforgettable night. We will see you next time. Give it up for the band! And the dancers. And of course, Sabrina. I love you, Taylor. That's our show. We love you were young. We were lost in the cold. Pulled up to you in the jag. Turned your axe into gold. The winding road leads to the chateau. You remind me of a younger me. I saw potential. I'll be your father figure. I drink that brown liquor. I can make deals with the devil because my check's bigger this morning.
