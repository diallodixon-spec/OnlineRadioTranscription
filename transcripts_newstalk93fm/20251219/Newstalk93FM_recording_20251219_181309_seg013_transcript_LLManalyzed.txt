20251219 181309 The greatest pleasure in my life. Cause when you're living by the moon, honesty and replace, home is where the heart should be. Pretty feathers in disguise. Not to give up, we will rise. So don't you ever let me down again. Cause I'm depending on you, so you better come through this time Please hear my cry and if I ever Let you down my friend It was a misunderstanding So if I took it for granted Then I promise from today I'll go drunk like I never drunk Waved like I never waved W, like I never went before Just to show you I'm sorry, I'm sorry And I need you back in my life You got people by the truck Emotions running high We underpin the sky Tears running down we eye Can't you tell I'm sorry
