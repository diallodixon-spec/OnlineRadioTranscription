And as long as we are adhering to strict border protection initiatives, then we, on a mass scale, we're not expecting the introduction of bird flu. But I hasten to say that Jamaica is one of those countries where birds from other countries will migrate to in the winter. And by in so saying, we know that bird flu has been confirmed in the USA and in Canada. Birds do migrate south and migrate to Jamaica during the winter time. And we are in the winter time or just about to be in. So despite our best efforts in terms of managing what comes into Jamaica by our ports, our travel, our food imports, et cetera, there is always a risk that wild birds could bring this virus to Jamaica.
