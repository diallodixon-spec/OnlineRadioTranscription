20251223 194836 I gotta get my body moving, shake the stress away. I wasn't looking for nobody when you looked my way. I said, well, care today, yeah. Who knew that you'd be up in here looking like you do? You make staying over here impossible. Baby, I'mma say your aura is incredible if you don't have to go, though. Do you you know what you thought it? I just didn't hit a party. But now we're rocking down the dance floor at tonighty. Your hands are on my waist, just let the music play. We're hand in hand, just to trust, and now we face the waves. I want to take you away, stop the tape until the music, DJ, DJ let it play I just can't refuse ya, like the way you do ya, keep on rockin' to it Please don't stop the, please don't stop the music
