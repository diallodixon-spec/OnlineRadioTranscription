20251231 194436 So scared of breaking it that you won't let it bend And I wrote two hundred letters that I will never send Sometimes these cuts are so much deeper than they seem You'd rather cover up, I'd rather let them be So let me be, and I'll set you free, oh yeah I am in misery There ain't nobody who can comfort me, oh yeah Why won't you listen to me? The silence is slowly killing me, oh yeah You really got me bad, you really got me bad
