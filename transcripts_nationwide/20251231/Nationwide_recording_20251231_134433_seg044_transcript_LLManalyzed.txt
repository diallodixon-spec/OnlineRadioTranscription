I know you're just pretending, but everything is fine People saw you smiling, you were just putting the best outside I bet you had another fight again last night, oh baby But if ever you need a lover to take you by the hand I'll be waiting here for you, girl If there's trouble at home, then you can't take the pain, boy Baby come chill with me, baby come chill with me
