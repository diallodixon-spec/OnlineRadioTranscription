20251231 192213 No one else can touch my heart like you do I can search for all eternity long And find there is none like you I've had many tears and sorrows Questions for tomorrow There's been times I didn't know right from wrong But in every situation God gave me consolation That my trust has come to make me strong. Through it all, through it all, I've learned to trust in Jesus, I've learnt to trust in God.
