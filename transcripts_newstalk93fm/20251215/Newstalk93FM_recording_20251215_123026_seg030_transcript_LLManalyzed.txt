20251215 123026 We're alone again, every moment stolen, yeah Feelings I've been holding in, it must be love Whenever I'm broken, you make me feel whole Whenever I'm lonely, you're there for my soul Wherever you are, girl, that's why I call my own Whenever you doubt it, I'll be letting you know Girl, I want to be dancing with you forever You sit through the storm and take me as I am Baby, it's magic anytime that we're together I'll make her just love you and hold you for my hand Hold you for my hand, hold you for my hand
