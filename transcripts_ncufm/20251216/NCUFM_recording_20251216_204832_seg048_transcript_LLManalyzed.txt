20251216 204832 Lord our God is a sword and shield Fight our battles on our knees We are united in Jesus Christ We are the soldiers of the light We don't wrestle flesh and blood But principalities of the dark We too are marching to one beat Crushing the enemy under our feet We are mighty in a stand With God's Word in our hands. Lord our God is a sword and shield. The Lord our God is our sword and shield.
