20251223 142217 Last night, and the world was ending I wanna be next to you Lost, lost in the words that we speak I don't even wanna do this anymore Cause you already know what you mean to me And all of the only ones we're fighting for Wherever you go, that's where I'll follow Nobody's promised tomorrow So I'ma love you every night like it's the last night Like it's a last night If the world was ending I wanna be next to you If the party was over and our time on earth was through
