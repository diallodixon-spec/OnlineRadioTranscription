Working till the sun don't shine Looking forward to happier times on Blue Bayou I'm going back someday Come what may to Blue Bayou Where the folks are fun and the world is mine all blue by you. Where those fishing boats with their sails afloat, if I could only see that familiar sunrise through sleepy eyes, how happy I'd be. Gonna see my baby again.
