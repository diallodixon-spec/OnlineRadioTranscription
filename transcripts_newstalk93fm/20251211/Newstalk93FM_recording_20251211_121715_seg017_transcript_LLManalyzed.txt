I love my culture and love where we from We get these powers from this same nation. Sweet like steel, drop the sweetest vibrations. Don't let the rhythm get you, just run. Run, run, run. Even you could handle it, German. But like when the man will hide, we go rip it up a spike. Oh, lord. Goodbyes and party, we love it, sweet woman, we have it, greatest on the planet, boy. Somebody radio loud playin' a song and it goes and I fuck, and if I lose myself inside this place, well I show my shit up, empty soca and glass when the bitch across the mat.
