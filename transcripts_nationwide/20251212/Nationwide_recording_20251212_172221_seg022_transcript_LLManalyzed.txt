20251212 172221 images released to the House Oversight Committee that is looking into the actions and connections of Epstein. Among the notable figures shown are celebrities including the film director Woody Allen, the Microsoft founder Bill Gates, and Richard Branson, founder of the Virgin Empire. Trump features in three of the 19 images. In one, he's photographed with six women, some in Hawaii dress and whose faces are blacked out. In the second, he is seen alongside Epstein listening to a woman with blonde hair who appears to be sharing a joke. In the third, apparently taken aboard on an aircraft, he is sitting alongside another woman with another blonde hair, with longer blonde hair and whose face is also blacked out. The White House responded to the release in a statement accusing Democrats of selectively sherry-picking the photographs for political purposes and trying to create a false narrative.
