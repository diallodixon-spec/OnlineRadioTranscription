============================================================

I'm trying to get paid, take money, cash checks. You see the set, that's Lash, that's Dex. Young C, young Shorty, Milka Veli. White bricks, true religion on the telly, it's me. Wiz got the house full of freaks. That's why I haven't been around for a week. I'm getting pounds in my sleep. I'm at the top of the mountain, it's peak. Bring it back before the villain. I had a life, real talk, true religion. It's in the blood, in the genes, in the stitching. Walked in, no weapon, made a killing. Tongue kissing pretty women. New iPhone cause I'm done with all the... Trying to be in my position, keep my shades on cause they're trying to see the vision. You tell me bad man see I need your love, see I need you love. Me need you close to me, me tell her see me or stay on the road, bad energy stay far away.
