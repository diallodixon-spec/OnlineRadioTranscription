As I said, I noted before this scenario as it plays out with the US and Venezuela. And it seems to me that unless there is, as I indicated before, some resolution, it seems that involvement in Venezuela could very well be sooner rather than later. You don't have so much hardware so far at such a cost without intending to do something with it. That's a fact. The warship that is there, it costs millions a day to be there because enough of an airspace is more than saber-rling, because you're not limiting a sovereign nation's ability to have flights in and out. That, no doubt, was something precipitated by Maduro, who also indicated certain aircraft or airlines are banned from going into Venezuela, ramping up all of this.
