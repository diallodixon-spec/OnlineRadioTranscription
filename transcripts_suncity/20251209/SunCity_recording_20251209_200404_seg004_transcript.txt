You're sure you're not diabetic? When do you have to get your blood sugar checked? Blood sugar? You know business about them things. I just know it's food for eat. Join us for Talking Diabetes inside the Sun City Morning Show as we explore diabetes and how we can manage this condition. Learn more about health and wellness initiatives because when you have diabetes, every decision is important. Let's start the talk today and make a change.
