20251224 143829 That I'll be loving you As today I know I'm living for tomorrow Could make me the past, but that I mustn't fear For I know, deep in mind The love of me I've left behind Cause I'll be loving you away Until the day is night and night becomes the day Until the trees and seas just up and fly away until the day that eight times eight times eight is born until the day is the day
