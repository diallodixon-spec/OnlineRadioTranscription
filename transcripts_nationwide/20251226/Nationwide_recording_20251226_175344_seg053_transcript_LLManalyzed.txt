20251226 175344 Don't stop me fallin', it's destiny fallin' A power I just can't deny It's never changing, can't you hear me? I'm sayin' I want you for the rest of my life Together forever and never too fast Together forever we too And don't you know I would move heaven and earth To be together forever with you You, you, you say that you really love me I'm always on your mind And you say I should be alone And we should spend some time But I know, as sweet as that sweet thing My heart has been broken before you came So if you want to be my lover You have to prove your love
