20251216 153521 Thank you for the lovely bouquet. You're sweeter than a peach, but you don't know the life of a showgirl, babe. And you're never, ever gonna wait. The more you play, the more that you pay. You're softer than a kitten, so you don't the life of showgirl, babe, and you're never gonna wanna. I took her pearls of wisdom, hung them from my neck. I picked my dudes with every bruise I knew what to expect. Do you want to take a skate on the ice inside my veins? They ripped me off like false lashes and then threw me away. And all the headshots on the walls of the dance hall are of the witches who wish I'd hurry up and die But I'm immortal now, baby dolls I couldn't if I tried So I say Thank you for the lovely book
