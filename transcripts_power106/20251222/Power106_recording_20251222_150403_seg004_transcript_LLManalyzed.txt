20251222 150403 Let me just finish up that previous question where someone was asking if an elderly family member gets married without notifying any relatives if the marriage can be annulled. And simply because someone did not notify a relative isn't enough to justify or enough to apply for an annulment in Jamaica and in Jamaica it is almost impossible or I should say extremely difficult to have a marriage annulled and I just want to reiterate be very careful who you have taking care of your elderly relatives because some persons literally seek these jobs to get close to these persons. You know, these persons sometimes when they're alone, they're lonely.
