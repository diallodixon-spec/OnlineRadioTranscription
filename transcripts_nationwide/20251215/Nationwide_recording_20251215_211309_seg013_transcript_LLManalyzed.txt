20251215 211309 I like crashing waves But I wanna see them at first light After a long night And see the sky take shape But I wanna see the stars burn After I had my turn You're working so hard You played your card So what's the pay off? And ooh, ooh Big tool, kiss cheap You gotta go deeper than deep To get me up If you're picking up my gold Come and do your wash You know that I'm in control I'm in control Don't you know I want it all Put your hands against the wall I'm in control I'm in control
