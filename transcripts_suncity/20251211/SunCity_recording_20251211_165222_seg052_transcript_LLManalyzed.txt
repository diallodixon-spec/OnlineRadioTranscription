I know, I know, all the day you won't be perfect But tell me can you stand the rain Little lady, you look so fine Can't turn my eyes away You are now the next Alipatch. And dance so very slow I know that we don't know each other well But I can't believe I'm wasting your time Oh no, so tell me what to do
