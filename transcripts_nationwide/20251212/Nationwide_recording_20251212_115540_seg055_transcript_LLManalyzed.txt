2025-12-12 12:20:54 We're going to have an area. So, what we're going to be doing is free listings just to say that we were closed but now we're open for Hurricane Melissa. So, as usual, we are partner, we are community partner, we are business partner and we did kind of go a little bit left field with the water thing but but it's still with one of our advertisers. But bringing it back to what we know and what we do best on findyellow.com, we'll be securing our area free for a lot of businesses to come and say, hey senior public relations and marketing officer at the National Water Commission. Thank you so much. Thank you. Good, good. All right, that's where we're going to leave it for this morning, the morning session.
