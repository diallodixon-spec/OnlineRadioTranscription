Because when I'm with you, I just know I'm fine. Know I'm fine. You take all the pressure off my mind. All the time. Patient and kind will not be going out my mind. Say, from the problems, I don't worry, because I'm hard to find. I'm from the block, baby. It's you and I, baby. If the world turn against me, who I got, baby? I'll set you up, baby. I've been a block, baby, it's you and I, baby If the world turn against me, who I got, baby? But set your eyes, baby, up in a flock, baby I'm talkin' I-I-I, I-I, I, I, baby I know I just call you right now, yeah, yeah I feel it right at home, save me your arms, baby, come hold me down
