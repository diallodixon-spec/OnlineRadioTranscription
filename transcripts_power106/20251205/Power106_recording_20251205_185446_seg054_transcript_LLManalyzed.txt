Nothing less we'll do for those raucous fans in that stadium. Alright Manchester City, alright. Etihad and Sunderland with a great French coach. Talk quickly about that at 10 o'clock tomorrow. Manchester City have been the most entertaining team so far in the last few match days. They're in games that just goals are coming left, right and center. They were in a nine game thriller, nine goal thriller. Nobody expected them and for them to play a nine goal game ending 5-4. So they continue to entertain and they'll be playing against another entertaining team in Sunderland. So I can see five goals in that game, but I that Holland will be the difference-maker as he has been from the start of the season so a 3-2 win for Manchester City is what I'm looking for in this crazy Christmas period. Yes, as long as Holland continues to be fit then everybody else is in a problem. All right Spurs at home to Brentford 10 o'clock
