20251216 111915 If a boy is found with a bag of weed, he goes to pitney prison. What kind of country is this? And I would love for somebody, especially a lawyer, to contest me. Come and contest Herbert Samuel Gale. That's not what happens. The little girl gets counseling and the boy goes to a correctional center for having a bag of weed that his father, mother or auntie or uncle or somebody give him to go hustle with. And now we hear from our toy gun. Big problem. Now don't start me off today now. The entire approach towards boys in Jamaica itself is criminal. That's where the crime is. Okay. Crazy man. Don't tell me the state is contributing to the creation of some very horrible creatures because when you oppress them like that, what do you think they do? What do you think trauma does? Unnecessary trauma.
