20251216 181313 We're from a small island and we currently, you know, we don't have quite a number of like under 16 teams to compete with as in Jamaica where you have several high schools all across the islands, multiple high schools in different parishes. We just have a few major high schools like Clifton Hunter, John Gray, Cayman Prep, you know, CISver Fish, and just a few others. And the competition level here for the under 16 ladies that we have brought into the program since early September was not there. And so we decided, or the executive committee decided to try to find a competition for them since the ladies were playing and we wanted to find out where they're at because ultimately we would like to attend the Jean Pierre tournament in April of next year.
