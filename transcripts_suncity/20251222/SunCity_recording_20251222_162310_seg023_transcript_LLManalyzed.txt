20251222 162310 Jumping sailor baby All them things they're saying Can't stop me from jumping When I start to whine I have no control The carnival fever is in me soul When I hear them pan like I've gone insane The carnival blood running in me veins I love to feel Your body when it goes to mine. When you and I become as one, it's an extra degree. When we move to the melody, come on and give it to me, baby. When you up your wits You raise my passion Yes, come on And give it to me, baby When you up the wits I bet that it's the reaction You drill me the way you do
