travel and quality roads. Welcome to Auto World on Power 106 FM. I'm Shelen McLaggen. It's Thursday, December 4th, 2025, and today we're going to be joining Mr. Kevin McKenzie, Director of Motor Ventures Limited and ASC Mazda technician as we share with you a shortened version of our program today. We're looking at engine misfiring and what it is and some of the causes and repair options and we're talking about misfiring and the modern engine.
