20251224 090003 You're listening to Sleek Radio, 93 FM. I feel your frequency from miles away. You come alive with one wine, baby. With you, I want to dance the night away. One jam's in a lifetime, baby. So don't feel away. You don't like the fast life They look on the bright side I go take the blame I just want you come and bite it up Just a little whine enough Come and meet me behind the truck and we rev it up Whole day keep throwing it back I know why you stop Baby no way
