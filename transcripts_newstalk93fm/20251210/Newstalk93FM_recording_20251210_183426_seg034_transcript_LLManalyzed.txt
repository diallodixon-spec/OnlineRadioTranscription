Yeah. So put your number in my phone Cause I don't wanna judge a book by the drama But the way I see you, I let no bar for you I'm falling, falling, falling Be with me, can't just let you And I wanna keep your secret You got me falling, falling, love you till the sun starts to smile Tell your song and meet at night
