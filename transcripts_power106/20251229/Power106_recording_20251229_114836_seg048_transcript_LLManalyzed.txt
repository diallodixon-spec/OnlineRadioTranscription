20251229 114836 Hey, welcome back, everyone. Welcome back, folk. We are speaking with Grace Boston. She's coordinator of the Grade 7 Academy at Holy Trinity High School. And we're talking about how the school decided to address the literacy problem at the Grade 7 level, which we know is a problem across 80% of our schools in Jamaica. Sebastian, we're talking about the process of making this change. So we want to talk about food. We want to talk about self-esteem. We wanna talk about all of those things that were involved. Help us understand how schools can make this kind of change. I'm sorry, was the first word you said you want to talk about, did you say food? Food, yes. Absolutely, absolutely. So Dr. Gayle, one of the most expensive ticket items in the world.
