20251212 214021 You can last all night, don't get too excited Privacy You ain't gotta go nowhere, you can stay inside it Can you blow my mind? Set off my whole body If I give you my time Can you stretch my soul from me? I don't wanna wait Don't take it Take me where I ain't been before Can me lose my breath, make me water.
