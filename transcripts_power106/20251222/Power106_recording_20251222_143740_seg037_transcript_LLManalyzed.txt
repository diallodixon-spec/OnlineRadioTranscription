20251222 143740 I'm discussing the documents needed when buying and selling property. And there are two main documents that are going to be signed by the parties, the agreement for sale and the instrument of transfers. I was saying the instrument of transfer is a standard form document that's used toward the end of the transaction. That's what's submitted to the title's office to have the purchaser's name put on the title. Let me continue with our messages. I got a summons for non-payment of property taxes, but I had sent the money to a relative and I can prove this. Is this enough to get out of the summons? What do you think? You think the government is going to know, or better yet, do you think the government will care that you sent the money to a relative and whatever the relative did or didn't do with the money? Absolutely not. The government won't care.
