20251212 111809 I live my life by the moon If it's hot, let it low, if it's hot let's go slow And if it's full, then go But after midnight, morning will come And the day will see, if you're gonna get some They say that girl, you know she act too tough, tough, tough But it But still I turn off the light, turn off the light They say that girl you know she act so rough, rough, rough But still I turned off the light, turned off the light And I say follow me, follow me, follow down, down, down, till you see all my dreams Not everything in this magical world is quite what you see me like Where's the love that I'm looking for?
