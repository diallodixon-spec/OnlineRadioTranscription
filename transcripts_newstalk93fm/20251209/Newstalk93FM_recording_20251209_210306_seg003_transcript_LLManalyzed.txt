Prepare a place in your heart That's where it all starts A place in your heart Make love very soft Then baby, prepare a place In your heart Let me take you to the fall In the roundabout Wedding bells in my ears You in my thoughts I keep every secret Your victory or loss You see every mistake You see every flaw Still I love you the you, me love you, me baby Love you, me, love you, hey, look at me. Look at me, baby. I, I'm in love with you. Look at me. Love me, baby. In love with you. And you fall in love. It's like a brand new time. It fills you up. You are.
