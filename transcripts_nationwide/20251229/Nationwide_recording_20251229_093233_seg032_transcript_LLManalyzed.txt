You can use it to drive on like on your temporary visa, but not pass your I-94 for sure. And remember, guys, every state is different. So you'd have to, my best advice to you is to check with a DMV in whatever state you're going to. Florida's going to be different, maybe from New York. So you will have to just check, please just Google the DMV in whatever State you're going to be visiting to see if they will accept the regular driver's license or the international, but usually it's the international. Mostly from Jamaica, they kind of have an international license too. All right, thank you. That's it. I have been driving with a regular Jamaican driver's license for years and never thought about it.
