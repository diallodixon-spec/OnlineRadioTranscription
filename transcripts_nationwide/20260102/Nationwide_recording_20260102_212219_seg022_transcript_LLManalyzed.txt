20260102 212219 expansionary policy. I think the government needs to support or put measures in place to really induce expansionary, you know, you have to have expansionary kind of thinking going forward. How do you expand the economy? How do you increase GDP? What is needed? One of the most important things is financing and support for those sectors that are going to drive both agriculture, building and construction, some of the service industries, manufacturing of all kinds. Those are things that need support to push the GDP of the country. If you don't do that, then we are going to be in the same 1% situation. This 5% over that particular period of time in that last quarter, I would question every single item on that list because at the end of the day, if we're going to grow, we need financing to grow. And if we're not getting it from that side, and the BOJ, if you hear what they say, time and time again you listen to Richard Biles at BOJ.
