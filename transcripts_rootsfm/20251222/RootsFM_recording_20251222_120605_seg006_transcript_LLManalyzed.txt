20251222 120605 The children who are left behind in those communities, those who you lose, their father, those who lose their mother, remember those children, for it's a time of giving and a time of caring, Father, for today on this hour of Christmas. Can I say thank you, Lord? I thank you, Lord, for every denomination and thank you for every church. I thank you for every entertainers, I thank you for everyone who are bringing love and love to those people in the West. And I thank you. And I pray today that their basket will never be empty, but they are extending the love to all those who are in need and all those who are really in need right now in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth. So we just give you thanks, Father. So on this weekend's line today, the request, Father, from my people in Central and Central, God almighty, that day the crime rate will continue to go down. Unity Drive, that peace will continue to reign. Unity Avenue, that peace continue to reign. Fairview Drive, hallelujah, Fairview Avenue.
