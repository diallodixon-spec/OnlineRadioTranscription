20251212 183721 Some challenge there Congratulations, even before enough the Brazilian guy hearing me. Yes. I'm hearing your shade. Go ahead. Hello. Oh Yeah, even one of the members of the Brazilian bobsleigh team the younger guys said to one of my managers that Shane is going to win the race and you have this Korean guy who always telling me that I'm going to win. So they know I am going to win before I even know that I'm gonna win. So that's that's their reaction and that's what they basically say to me from time to time. Just before the break also, I don't remember who it was. We were talking about the warm-up exercise and others mimicking the warm-up. Who? Jersey. Was it Taekwondo?
