20260102 111612 stop doing now is stop stealing light and water. We must pay for what we use. Thank you. Have a blessed day. Thank you very much for that, Andrea. Good morning, Mr. Andre. What the country needs now is to increase the size of the institutions on Windward Road to hold the people with warp thinking. It will help with even the situation on the road. People can't be driving on the road and don't see where they are going. All right. Thank you for sharing that. Remind Miss Lucy that her party controlled the hurricane fund. All right. Well, Ms. Luce, her concern is the whole matter of it not going to the church, and she said why. Now, that I agree with her, but she's entitled to her point of view.
