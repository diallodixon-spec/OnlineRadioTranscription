20260101 203730 inspiration came from hearing an old man singing it, a reminder that the song already had a long life before it was ever written down. The phrase Auld Lang Syne itself is from the Scots language and roughly means for old times sake. The poem was meant to remind people of friendships, shared memories and moments that shaped them in the time that was. In Scotland, it became customary to sing it at Hogsmanay, or New Year's Eve as we call it, often while holding hands in a circle. So let me paint a picture. Everyone stands in a circle holding hands. Then at the beginning of the final verse, and there's a hand my trusty friend, they cross their arms across their bodies so that their left hand is holding the hand of the person on the right and their right hand holds that of the person on their left. When the song ends everyone rushes to the middle still holding hands and probably giggling.
