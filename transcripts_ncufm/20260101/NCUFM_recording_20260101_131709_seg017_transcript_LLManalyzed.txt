20260101 131709 Let your heart reach out right here, right now For the Lord to touch your life Don't ever doubt that God can lift us high Allow the claim of heaven to be our guide Every moment as though it was your last. Before the thief of always steals tomorrow from your grasp. Before the chance to know his love has somehow passed.
