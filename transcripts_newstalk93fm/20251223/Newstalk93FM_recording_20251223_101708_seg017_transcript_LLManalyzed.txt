20251223 101708 I feel like I can't do what I'm supposed to. And I can't even pick myself up out of bed. You come around with so much energy. Fill me with such melodies. Oh, my Z-Motivation. When you speak to me, I hear a song Every word you say feels like a poem I will take you with me everywhere Listen to you every day Why are you my sweet inspiration? I never wanna say goodbye This love sleep I won't take a break this symphony
