Yes, we have relaxed their bills. As a matter of fact, we are distributing water to the farmers in those affected areas as we speak. I'm telling you from a truck standpoint, we have distributed over 4 million gallons just by trucking alone. And through a regular system, we are distributing over 37 million gallons throughout the period. If you create that to monies, you say we are talking in excess of a million dollars, that the government would have said yes, we are making that contribution to the farmers recovery effort. We look forward to your continued effort, your energy.
