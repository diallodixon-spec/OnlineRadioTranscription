20251230 171611 Blessings to you, Andrew Donaldson. Sister Thea Barnes, welcome on board the drive to you and the family. All right, Sister Althea. Get everybody tuned in. We continue with the show. I'm gonna play this one for you from the Gaitha Vocal Band as we start setting, turning the steering wheel. We have an interview coming up at 5.30. A pastor and an advocate for women. Will be on with me once more. We're as different as night and day. We're the same in different ways. And it's true. Just look at me and you.
