My feelings today swing like Django lover. Feelings today swing like Timbani Kajuru Adju. I'm a white dog, he will find me soon. Why you say I did nothing for you? If I do anything you want me to do Baby another time, maybe another life You will be my wife and we'll get it right We don't cast, last last Now everybody go chop breakfast Have to say bye bye yo, bye bye yo To the love after life
