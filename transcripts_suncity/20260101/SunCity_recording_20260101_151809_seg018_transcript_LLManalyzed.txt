20260101 151809 Just take a look at you Then I'm not so good When you're close to me I can feel your heartbeat I can hear you breathing in my ear Wouldn't you agree? Baby, you and me, that groovy kind of love. Anytime you want to, you can turn me into anything you want to. Anytime at all all When I kiss your lips, ooh I start to shiver Can't control the quivering inside
