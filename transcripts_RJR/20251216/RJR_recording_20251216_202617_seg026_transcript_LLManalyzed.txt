I need to know from Jay, as Jay said, how long he's had this issue because if he's had it for five or 10 years and it has not really changed in its size, then it's so not worth worrying about. If it's something that just now popped up in the last few months and it's getting larger, it's definitely more worrisome. A growing swelling that does not hurt is not usually a good thing. I mean, swellings that don't belong, they are not usually good things, but it's particularly ominous when you have something that is growing anywhere on your body, happened over a short period of time, and it is not reacting to you pressing on it, causing any pain or tenderness.
