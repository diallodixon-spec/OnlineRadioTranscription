20251226 095535 You say you need someone To be there for you To love you all night long It's kinda funny but I don't think you have to look a little further. Because I'm ready. And I'm ready to do all the things you've been doing. Tell me what kind of man would treat his woman so cold. Treat you like you're nothing When you're worth more than gold Girl, to me you're like a diamond I love the way you shine A hundred million dollar treasure I'd give the world to me
