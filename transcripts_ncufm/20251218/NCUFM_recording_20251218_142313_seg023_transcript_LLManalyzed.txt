20251218 142313 Feel this void and emptiness Shine your light on my darkness Satisfy and restore my soul I long for you. Make me whole. Come quench this thirst. Lord, I am ready. Here I am. Come fill my heart. You are the only one who can fill my heart. Come feel my heart. You are the only, who can feel me. Here I am waiting, come feel my heart. My heart.
