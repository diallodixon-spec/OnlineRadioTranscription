20260102 194924 Hey, I'm the world's greatest. I am an ego. I live in Sun City, baby. Down in the jungle. I am a margin band. I am the people. I am a heavenhead. I am a hero. Anybody like you is who I am. Just stand up tall, looking at my face and say. I know I can. See what I want to be. You know what, what it is.
