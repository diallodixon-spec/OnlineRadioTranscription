20260101 154934 Hey, oh, love is against the law. Hey, we're riding on the freeway. Love in the pink hat and hat. This is what I want you to do, baby. Freeway. Let's get over the left lane. And that's much for people. Oh, yeah. Freeway. Take a long exit. And then make a right turn. Go on over to love and satisfaction. Enjoy it all. And we're out of here. And we're cruisin' down. Let's be good to each other, Street!
