20251226 133820 I'm going to reach here because I'm overloaded. What are you saying? Yes. No, I sleep out the first part of the morning. I'm tired. I said, you know, I'm not going to sleep. I'm not going at one place to go. At different places, I'm at one place. I said, I'm going. And I said, I don't eat nothing until I reach there. So I'm going there. I had my bellies full. And then this morning, one place I didn't get to go, I said, Kevin, make sure when you reach your mother's house, you get my Christmas something, you know, because you know I said I have to eat it the morning of Christmas. Now I understand that you know. But you know the shameful part now, when he gave me last night, I put it in the freezer, freezer you know. I said I'm not putting it in the fridge, I'm putting it in the freezer because I want it iced up because I'm not eating it until Saturday. So I put it, by this morning I pass the container to him.
