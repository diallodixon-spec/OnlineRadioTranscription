20251224 125022 I'm making boundaries Walls so thick that you won't climb Lines so long that you can't find my heart Will never be something for anyone to trample on again Gotta protect me to the end Every no is a yes to yourself I appreciate love and show up for yourself Can't beat the world, be at one with yourself You I'm making boundaries.
