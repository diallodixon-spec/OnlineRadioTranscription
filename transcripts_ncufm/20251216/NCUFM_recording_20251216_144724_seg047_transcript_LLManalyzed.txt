20251216 144724 Will somebody tell me the crash position? Hey, sit down! Oh, Lord, I don't want to die. I'll give you 50% of my pay. I'll go to church every Sunday, except maybe Super Bowl Sunday. Ladies and gentlemen, just to let you know, the emergency vehicles are on the runway and prepared for any catastrophe. Okay, Super Bowl Sunday! This is your captain speaking. We have successfully lowered the nose gear. That's right, God. 20% of my pay. I'll go to church every Sunday. We'll negotiate football season. Just get me home. Ladies and gentlemen, we have successfully lowered all landing gear. Sorry for the inconvenience. What do you need all that money for, God? I only get two days off a week. Are you God's servant every day? Or only when you need him? Another message from Lifeline Productions. The comic strip of radio at lifelinepro.com.
