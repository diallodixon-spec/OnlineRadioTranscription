20251219 092814 people don't want to do the touristy stuff you know so when they get to come here a lot of them will do the blue hole in Ocho Rios they will do the ATV that takes you up the Spanish bridge and you swing off the rope and all of that they will do the rafting down by Rio Nuevo you know I mean they will go to Mahogany Beach they will go and do the cool runnings, catamaran that takes you to Duns River and back, but it's a party boat. And they will do the horseback riding, land and sea. Oh, so the things, the stereotypical things that I think people want to do, they don't actually, they want the authentic, authentic stuff. They want to see and meet and talk with people. Yes. Okay. All right. Well, just once again, can you remind our listeners where you want to, where people can go if they want to book and all your social media handles? Go on TikTok, type in FIWI, F-I-W-I Express Jamaica, and you'll find the transportation business. Go on TikTok and IG again.
