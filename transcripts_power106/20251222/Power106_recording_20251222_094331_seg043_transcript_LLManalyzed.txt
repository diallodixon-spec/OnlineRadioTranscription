So it shows that people are not really focused and they're not paying attention to it. So I'm asking individuals who are listening to review your current contributions, right? Maybe you can do more because we know historically the statistic is not favorable in terms of voluntary contributions. A lot of people don't do them. So, you know, remember we can contribute up to 20% of our gross salary to a registered pension plan and that these contributions enjoy a tax-deferred status. In other words, they can grow in the pension fund until retirement tax-free basically, right? And they give you a break with your taxes. Also, remember that to pay yourselves.
