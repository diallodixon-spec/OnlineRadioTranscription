20251224 214540 Give thanks, give thanks and praise. Give thanks and praise and praise, oh my God. Come let us give thanks and praise to the beast and the moth, but they won't flash alive and roll under. Blow the breeze and let the rain fall in. Only a lonely bird prays, come on. To rid of the bad mind, crime, and violence. And praise him in the morning, noon, and evening. And also in the night time too. So give give thanks give thanks and praise give thanks and praise down to the most high god you World. It's the only program on Jamaican radio dedicated to the world of automobile.
