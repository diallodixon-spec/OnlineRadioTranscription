20251225 165842 Take my chances with these feelings that I have And I'll come back to this same corner where we met And I'll be here every year, every Christmas My words can't explain the pain and the fear Cause I wonder, yes I wonder Are you gonna leave me standing here? Today's almost over But I don't wanna be alone
