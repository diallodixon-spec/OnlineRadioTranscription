20260101 173727 Do you remember last year? When they said that you'll never make it I believe that this year Watch God turn it in your favor I believe it, I believe it I believe I got a feeling this is gonna be my year. Flavor, grace, gonna feel my atmosphere. So I start singing. So I start dancing. This is going to be my year So don't tell me that I should not believe it All I know is God is on my side
