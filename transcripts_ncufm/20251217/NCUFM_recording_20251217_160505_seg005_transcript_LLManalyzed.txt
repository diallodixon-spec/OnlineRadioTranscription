20251217 160505 Yeah man, so I'm sure they're great. So what role does faith really play in the business and why do you include Bible scriptures with every order? So I'm having faith with this type of business. You know anything can happen in the kitchen. And also being an entrepreneur overall, being an entrepreneur takes faith and takes believing. So I'm saying that I can't do anything without the Lord. Right. Everything I do has to praise him. So I started this business and I depended on faith. I depended on him to help me because I have this mindset where I like to give up whenever things get hard. So having faith, it plays a major role in my life, which it helps me not just as an entrepreneur but as a person. Yeah. So, stay strong to stay consistent and every every Bible verse really is to encourage every single artist that I get and every customer. You might never know what people is going through and that is a way also to spread the gospel and spread the message. Yes. Amen.
