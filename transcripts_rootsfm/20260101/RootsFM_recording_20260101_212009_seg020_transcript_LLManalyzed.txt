20260101 212009 I can do for you what Martin did for the people. Ran by the man, but the women keep the tempo. It's very seldom that you're blessed to find your equal. Still play my part and let you take the lead, bro. Believe me, I'll follow. This could be easy. I'll be there whenever you need me. I see you hustle with my hustle, I can keep you. Focus on your bumpers, I can feed you. You need a real woman in your life. You took my hair home and still fly. I can help you build up your kind of love. I'm vegetable, yeah. You're the one who's gonna lead me when you're in the beat.
