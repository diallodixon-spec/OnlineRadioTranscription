20251219 151107 I feel every beat of your heart. And throughout the night, I want to hold you tight. I want to wake up with you. All the love inside me has been sleeping. Waiting till the right one came along. You can share the love that I've been keeping, baby. You can put the music to my song. I wanna wake up with you, baby. I wanna reach out and know that you're there. I want you to be the first thing that I see. I want to wake up with you.
