20260101 122819 When we choose the ones we love Who knows why we do the things we do when we're in love I know that you're a decent man And you try to do what's fair But how can I forget All the feelings we have shared? I can't say goodbye to you. No matter how I try, you're such a part of me. Without you, I would die deep in the heart of me. I know that you and I were meant to be forever. I can't tell you good or bad. We were meant to be for life.
