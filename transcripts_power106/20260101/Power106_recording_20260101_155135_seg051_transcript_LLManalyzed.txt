I'll take it down. And no one's ever gone before. If you want more, if you want more, more, more Jump for my love Jump in, feel the touch Jump if you want to check My kisses in the nightly Jump, call my love. Jump, I know my heart, thinking you'll help me. Jump in, you know these arms, thinking you'll hurt me. Jump, if you want to check my kisses in the nightmare. Jump, jump call my love.
