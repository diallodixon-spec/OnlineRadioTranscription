Go find a woman and chat and laugh and run some jokes. And that be me still too. And celebrate the gift of life. Because we don't want no rapper, papa. We don't want no bag of bad man.

No sadata, get a r wrong bar And I make we join together as one I'm reaching out to every woman and man Every boy and girl join hearts and hands For the festive season make we sing a one song For the one of blood that runs through the Christmas
