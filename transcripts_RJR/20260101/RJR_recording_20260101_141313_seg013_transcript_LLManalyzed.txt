20260101 141313 You're not here with them, I call up, you're not a mix-up. Remember, you don't take nothing off your ratchet flight. Them you throw money, but if I ride you full of my dick bag. Imagine that, simple as half a sky. Because you never buy, use your brain, send a text, and you don't have to buy. You're not with man, you're gonna spend time. It's better you never buy nothing. Remember, say the word, go, we're not selling the world, we're not going, we're not guaranteeing, but if you still try some more Or if you jump in, send the gate wide open Work with the chicken if you can't buy mutton And that's why the guy can't press my button, ah We know we die, we know cryin' up, we know nothin' We know read the bit, we know it's nothin'
