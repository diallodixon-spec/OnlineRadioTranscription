20251226 093128 When you want all the love you've had And the heat from your mind I know that you don't mind Maybe that's just the way to end you I can't hold back when I'm feeling fine It's just the fact That you should be mine Anything you want You can't just throw it all, I need to know about you. Any one, one, one, any one, one, can you hold me for long? Oh, no. Any one.
