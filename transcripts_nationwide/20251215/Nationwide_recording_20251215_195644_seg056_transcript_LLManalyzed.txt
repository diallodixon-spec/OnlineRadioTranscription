I know normally if they are escorting government ministers or the prime minister, whatever, then that would be. But now it's coming like every other car you see have sirens and they you know the middle of the road Mr. Hughes I'm pushing you one side even sometimes the police themselves You do I don't think they're on any I well I don't know but the other day one of them let me bust my car in and Mr. Hughes cause me have come out of the way for him and I think the man was signaling to me say anyway you are serious, but I just want you to come out way because I know if they hit you there is nothing you can do about it because that happened to me already but for now I'm seeing cars with these lights and sergeants on them want somebody
