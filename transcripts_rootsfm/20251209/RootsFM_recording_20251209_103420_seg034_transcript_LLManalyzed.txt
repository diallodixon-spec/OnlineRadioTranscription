============================================================

we were like here we go again and Beryl was last year, here we go again, and it was very devastating for us also. But this morning we were going tonny up, because we are resilient people. And so I invited once again our brother, Guru, Guru, Mr. Theo Chambers, you know, motivational speaker, I almost said songwriter,, he could be a songwriter too, author, and of course, founder of Temple of Inner Peace, which has housed so many people from all over the world, a free space to come and just hold a vibration within the cosmos, within the, you know, ambiance of trees and birds and that sort of thing. So we were there this weekend as well and it really tonne we up. We get a real tonne up. Let's welcome Theo. Hey! And look who's there! Oh my God, I had my head straight. And there goes the beautiful Queen as well. Greetings, King and Queen.
