20251216 154331 Town Center, shop 40, and of course, our head office is inside the Pulse Complex on Trafalgar Road, shop 45, and we do pop-ups. We have international pop-ups, and we have pop-ups in Mandeville. We do pop-ups in Ocho Rios, close proximity pop-ups, because they want us. Not everybody's able to come into Kingston all the time. And so when we give them ourselves by coming or going to their location, it's a handful. It's a joy. What's that one thing before we go to the break that you think has propelled the growth of Just Natural over the years? We are. Just Natural, as the name suggested. We try to make it as simple but but more elegant we try to make sure everybody gets their full money's worth right and it's a family when you come inside just natural whatever it's like a meeting ground you change lives over the years
