hanging people and those old barbaric systems, they don't reduce homicides. Those things are proven. Long sentences scare people, but they have to work in tandem with quite a number of other things. In other words, if you are giving large numbers of persons long sentences, it becomes normal. But if you are catching people and their individual groups or a small group will be getting long sentences for very vicious crimes, then what happens is that that becomes a deterrent. But if you're giving long sentences to a whole large number of people it becomes a critical mass all right there are some countries i won't even name them because i think we already know that just like to to bundle people up in large prisons in fact El Salvador as well
