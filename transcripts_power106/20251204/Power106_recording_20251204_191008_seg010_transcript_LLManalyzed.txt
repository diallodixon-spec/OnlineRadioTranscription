on Facebook, Instagram, and X for the latest updates. Thank you for tuning in. I'm Anjclock, for those just joining, very happy to have you, particularly those in the diaspora, Canada, the United States, United Kingdom, the Eastern Caribbean. Well on Mondays to Fridays, only on the station. Power 116 FM, the digital sound, all those can and indeed contain. Coming up in the second half of our show here, we will be going to some music very shortly, and Christmas is in the air, no need to remind you about that particular thing.
