20251226 171205 Hey! Now nothing ever lasts forever, no One minute you're here and the next you go So I respect you and you take it slow I need a mental receipt to know this moment, uh-oh Do you mind if I steal a kiss and a little souvenir? Can I steal it from you to memorize the way you shock me? The way you move in here, just want to feel it from you. Don't be afraid to catch feels. Ride your cup and chase thrills I know you ain't afraid to pop Baby, I know you instead of catch feels Feels with me I'm your window shopper
