============================================================

I'm still stuck in the quicksand Enough to hear them say I'm the big man In Jamaica, all of them have the hit song All them two men, I hear them play in Finland I never hear them play in Pakistan That's it for me when I'm ready Love won't like you going down salt While we're there on the water on the ice Don't take a control on salt Give me a beat and a mic Ready because you'll never rise me. When remix a tune and drop it like a bomb, me no wanna waste, got ya critiqued.
