You're talking about normal travel for government officials. They would have to provide when they come back. For example, you get 400,000, right? And transportation, lodging and a meal. then we'll give them spending money well as I say I don't know for sure probably could be a case where that's worked out before and they would have to account for how they spend it yeah yeah they have to give account yeah all right no
