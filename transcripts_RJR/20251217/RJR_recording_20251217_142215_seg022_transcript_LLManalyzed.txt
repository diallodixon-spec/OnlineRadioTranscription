20251217 142215 Red or green flag. That's what we're into right now. Somebody said that's a grief. So they take long to reply to the message, but it's always thoughtful. You're good with that. I'm going to have to speed up that response time for me. That's another pet peeve for me, if I send you a message. You've got a window, like there's a window that I'm expecting you to respond in, you know what I mean? The window can't be like five hours. That's not the window. Then suppose I'm having an emergency and I need you to respond to me. If we get used to you just responding when you feel like, that's not good. No, busy, busy, really all the time. My people know my time.
