20251217 104131 you are prepared to go as far as to the Privy Council? Of course, of course, of course. It's not even a question. You understand? I'm not even a Christian. Council, council, um, that is prepared in this case for the appeal court and the grounds of the appeal, um, when that time come. And we are very serious about it. We are not compromising. So Mr. Davis can wish all he wants and say all he wants without looking at the facts, you understand, and believe that we're going to just gloss over this thing. It will not occur. Thank you very much. It's a 46 page judgment and we look at it and there are many, many, many points there and Paul Buchanan has just raised some of them and on the face of just one that he identified with, so many people can identify with easily, the box went unaccounted.
