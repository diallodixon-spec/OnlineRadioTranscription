20251225 111610 We don't rest on flesh and blood, but bring the palaties of the dark. We took a marching to one beat, crushing the enemy under our feet. We are mighty in our stand, with God's Word in our hand. We are united in Jesus Christ, we are the soldiers of the land We don't wrestle flesh and blood But bring the palaties of the dark We too are marching to unbeat Brushing the enemy under our feet We are mighty in our stand, with God's Word in our hand. In our hearts we have a vision, we have made our decision, to show the Father's love with great power from above.
