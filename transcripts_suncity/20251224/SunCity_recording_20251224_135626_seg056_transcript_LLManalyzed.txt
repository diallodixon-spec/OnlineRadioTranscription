20251224 135626 right now, right now. Everything I know is gone, everything I had is gone. Like you go on, you go on, till the end of the day. Hey, don't call me, I'm just over living more. And let me call out now, I'm dying now. Never said it's worth it say 2012, the world is gonna end What are we doing? Can it be stopped? It's just a tragedy to rule entirely But more they say, none of them can stop just the time Mountains may be seen Just take your time. We will cross with faith in us.
