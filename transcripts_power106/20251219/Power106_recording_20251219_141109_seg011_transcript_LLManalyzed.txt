Now, I can always call you Chazelle Thompson from H&L. Agos Chazelle, remind us which region you're in again. I'm South East. All right. Now, I can always count on H&L to support us in these kinds of activities. I would imagine that that is why you're here today. But H&L is also supporting the farmers out West who have been going through a very difficult period. So I want to start there.
