20260102 175338 Oh, my, my, you're taking me out of the ordinary. I want you laying me down. So we're dead and buried. On the edge of your night, staying drunk on your vibe. The angels up in the clouds are jealous. No one can bow. So this world is ordinary. You got me kissing the ground. Sanctuary, try to be what you're done. Oh, Lord, return me to dust. The angels up in the clouds are jealous, no one will be found. Something so heavenly, higher than next.
