So how many times people hear the word debt, you know? And of course, they are very concerned about that. Of course, you get stressed about debt and so on. But do you really be scared about debt in and of itself, Diane? Absolutely not. It is an overwhelming experience for most persons. Some persons would have been traumatized. But absolutely not.
