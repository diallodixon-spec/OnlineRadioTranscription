20251229 144127 Hey, good afternoon, going on to Bobby Fountain courtesy of Wapping Thursdays. In the meantime, my old drive, we say good afternoon to Owey. They call Owey the bicycle man, you know, so have a bless up, Owey. It's happening right here on your station, each and every day. Yeah, and I'm saying more power to the mustard seed communities for making this reality what it is. I'm gonna check this young lady right now because she have something to say to us. You mean when they get ten commercials for the price of five? No, you buy five commercials and get five water. They know the same thing.
