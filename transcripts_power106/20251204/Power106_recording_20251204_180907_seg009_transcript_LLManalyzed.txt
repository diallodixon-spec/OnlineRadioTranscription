The first poetry of Christmas musical selections on today's show, the sounds there of the great Boney M. I wonder how those good folk are doing long after the days when they were very much in the spotlight. All right, we're gonna be talking football in our main interview set, but the program, of course, Paul, play welcome to those of you who aren't bored at the minute, and hopefully you'll be joined by others in the diaspora a little bit later on as the show progresses. All right, more about the agricultural sector and the role we all play in its development. That's A Morning with the Minister, every second and fourth Friday of every month during Farm Talk with Althea MacKenzie on Power 106 FM.
