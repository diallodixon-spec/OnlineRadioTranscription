20251218 123222 state injuries, being hit by a motor vehicle on her way back from Linstein. It happened somewhere in the Bobbock Gorge, I'm told, and a passerby assisted her. She was unconscious, but she regained consciousness when she arrived at the hospital. She had done some x-rays and awaited a CT scan to be done. She has gotten some stitches for some lacerations and some bruisesises. She's been observed and we're hoping for the best at this time. Donna K. Sharp, mother of Laura Sharp. Those are her stories making a lunchtime sports report. Do stick and stay with us. We'll hear again at 5.25 later this evening. Until then, stay tuned, stay glued and stay locked in to Nationwide 90FM.
