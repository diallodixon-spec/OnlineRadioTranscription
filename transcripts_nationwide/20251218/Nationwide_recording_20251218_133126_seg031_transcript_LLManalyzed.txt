20251218 133126 We have provided care packages courtesy of the nationwide 90FM YouTube community, clothing donated by the Juticell Foundation, and textbooks from LMH Publishing, all of which have been handed over to the JCF for distribution on our behalf. While the nationwide team will not be on location, we encourage residents to come out and receive the support being provided. This outreach reflects Nationwide's continued commitment to help rebuild Jamaica, one community at a time. Thank you Supply Limited, Region 4 of the Ministry of Education,
