I'll travel a million miles just to look up on your smile. Baby, look to the clouds right now, say it to me I will be around for the entire night See baby, while I'm close I'll be here by your side You're doing things to me that I cannot deny The way you're looking girl, you are so certified Put Put me back one time when you give me that fast wine, fast wine, fast, fast wine. Take my boat to the dark side and anchor down by the bedside. Give me that fast wine fast wine fast wine.
