============================================================

I don't know where life will lead me But I know where I've been I can't say what life will show me But I know what I've seen Tried my hand at love and friendship But all that is passed and gone This little boy is moving on. Sitting here in limbo, waiting for the tide to flow, sitting here in limbo knowing that I have to go. Well, they're putting up resistance. But I know that my fate will lead me on. I can't say no.
