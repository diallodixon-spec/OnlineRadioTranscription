Less than six and a half miles between Trinidad and Venezuela. And they're not just neighbors. Geologically, Trinidad sits on the plate of Venezuela. Geologically. Trinidad does not sit on the plate with same plate as Tobago. If you know these two countries, Tobago is sandy and beautiful and simple. Trinidad is a different kettle of fish. Doesn't look anything at all like Tobago. Yeah? So, what's the risk? Do you risk it all now and then hope when Trump is removed from power, when his time comes you go by Venezuela and say, I was just trying to survive. I was just being smart, sir.
