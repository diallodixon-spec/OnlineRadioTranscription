No, but seriously, lock in though. Anything you need to do. Not for the woman alone, the woman them too. Yeah, man. No, you are absolutely right. I'm not telling you to focus on the man or woman, but lock in and focus on your goals for 2026. Happy birthday, Father Fresh. Have yourself a wonderful day. And Andrea says happy new year in advance. Jojo, be safe. Same to you, girl. Love you, no. Take care. Up next, it is Weed Seed. It is a print big priority. Reggae Wednesday.
