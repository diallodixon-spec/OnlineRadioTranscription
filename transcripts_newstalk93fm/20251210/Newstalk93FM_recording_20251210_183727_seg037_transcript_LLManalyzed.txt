Hey boy, I'm out for this hand on me nose Relax my mind, I'm trying to find you You're out the poop for me Now take no time for me All I need is liquor I can't please myself Me no need nobody else I can't please my self I don't need nobody else I I can't please myself. I don't need no body else. I love myself where it's most delicate. I'm not gay, but I'm not celibate. I could get up and left but I'm not ready yet. What's because of why you get me? I threw me in a one figure bun.
