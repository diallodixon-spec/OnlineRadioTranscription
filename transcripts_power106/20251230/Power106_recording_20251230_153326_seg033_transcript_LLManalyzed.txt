20251230 153326 I'm up on Jamaica, I'm a son of the sun I love the sea, I love the sun, Lord I love this land Don't matter where I go. Jamaica is my home. I love the girls. I hear some people say they are going away. But if I even leave, I would be going away to stay. I'm a Panjabita, I'm a son of the soil. I love the sea, I love the sun, oh Lord, I love the sand. Don't matter where I go, Jamaica is my home.
