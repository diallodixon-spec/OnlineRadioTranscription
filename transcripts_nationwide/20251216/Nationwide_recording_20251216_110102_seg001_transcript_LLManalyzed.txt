20251216 110102 Lisa, it is so good to see you. But sorry you catch me like this, girl. My uncle sent one by I talk about it in the media? You don't want to stop listening to hearsay? You ever experience that? Customs don't go into your package, suitcase, barrel or cargo unless you ship the item or the agent stand up right there when they're inspecting it. Listen, customs job is to protect the borders, collect revenue and to facilitate trade. They don't collect or store shipment, they inspect it and somebody after present it for inspection. Eh, so how customs ever get so much credit?
