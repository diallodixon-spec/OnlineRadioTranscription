There are days I feel like Nothing ever goes right Sometimes it just hurts so much But you're here, you're real I know I can trust you Even when it hurts, even when it's hard Even when it all just falls apart I will run to you Cause I know that you are Lover of my soul, healer of my scars You set in my heart
