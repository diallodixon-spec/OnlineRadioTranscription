20251226 121614 Who is Jesus to you personally? To those we send off in magnificent funerals, Jesus must have been their priority. That is why you take them to church for service and and loved Jesus as a family or you loved him because you are related to him through baptism or Will you be brought to Church because your family goes to church while you remain home or you go to work? There is more than enough rooms in my father's house, the scripture reads. If these were not, would I have told you that I am going to prepare a place for you? When everything is ready, I will come and get you so that you will always be with me where I am.
