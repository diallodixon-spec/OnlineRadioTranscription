20251229 174745 The councillors who are now part of the municipality of Portmore must attend meetings in Portmore in order for them to be compensated because they are first sworn in as councillors of the municipal corporation of St. Catherine. Mr. Jackson, I want to get you on that point because you say it is an attack on democracy. Dr. Wheatley makes a valid point that the Jamaica Labour Party promised in its manifesto that they would do this. The people of Jamaica voted them into office and one could say gave them a mandate specifically in relation to Portmore considering the outcome of the election and the members of parliament elected from that area. Why then do you continue to say it's an attack on democracy if they are simply fulfilling a promise made to the people of Jamaica that conceivably the people accepted when they voted them in?
