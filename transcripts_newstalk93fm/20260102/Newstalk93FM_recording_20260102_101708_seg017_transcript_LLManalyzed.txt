20260102 101708 Now the weekends are spent at the beach or the riverside She's always up for the ride and she likes to be up in the hills Far away from the noise when she just wanna chill She wants to hear the birds and bees when they sing And I'm glad that she does cause it's my kind of thing You can call it a perfect match I'm just happy that you let me in Finally She loves, she loves me now And I believe somehow There ain't no perfect play Finally She wants to come and stay Can't wait another day And now I don't feel so far away 41 days, 42 nights, 43 nights, 44 tries I must say it felt a kind of way But it was only you in my eyes
