20251226 175746 I wish I'd known it from the start That you'd come and bring my heart I can't hold it back these tears in my eyes Feeling the pain inside because I'm Dreaming of love, thinking of you Knowing someday you'll be back to my life I try to love But it just don't feel the same I love Someone's sending my time I don't take the blame Gotta love
