20251218 173228 I wish you and your family and your team all the best for the Christmas season. Yes, please don't overeat. Thank you so much, Shelley. And the same to you and yours and the team at Port. Yeah, man, thank you. I don't even have to over-party. Over-eating is not my thing, Shelley. So no partying and no eating. Okay, fine. No problem. So you'll be fine then. You'll be fine. Enjoy, Kevin, and all the best. Take care, you too. Cheers. All right, so there you have it, Mr. Kevin McKenzie, Director of Motor Ventures Limited and ASE Master Technician. They are sharing with us as we are looking at today's active noise control that is equipped in enough for motor vehicles, what it is and how these components work together. And that's where we leave it today on Auto World. We want to thank you very much for joining us. We'll be back tomorrow bringing you more interesting facts from the automotive industry. So until then, I'm Shelley McLaggen.
