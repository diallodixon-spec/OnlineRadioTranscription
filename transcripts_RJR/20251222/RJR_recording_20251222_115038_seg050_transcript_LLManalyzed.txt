20251222 115038 I'm so happy you did that because you know I feel that pain to point out that there's many places within and if you've given relief and you're coming to the people on the front line say okay there that's not it there are persons who are I have to get to them and the church is so good because they will know where people are they will know the members and the shut-ins yes absolutely so they were able to take some care packages and they say guess, we will reach them. So we were stationed at the church and then you had some elders, you had some persons who were willing to pack up the vehicle and say guess what, we're going to this street. We're going to reach this person. This person is unwell. They're unable to come on. We were happy we were able to do so.
