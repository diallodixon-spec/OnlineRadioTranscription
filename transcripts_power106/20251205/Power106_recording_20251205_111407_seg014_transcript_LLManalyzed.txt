I'm seeing a story. It's funny. Again, we keep repeating issues that we have rather than identifying the solution and the solution becomes permanent. Kingston has not received proper approval from the Kingston and St. Andrew Municipal Corporation. I'm sorry, the majority of signs erected in Kingston have not received proper approval from the case AMC. This came after an ongoing audit of signs and billboards in the corporate area to determine which of them have been erected legally within the case AMC, including billboards inside malls and plazas. The audit aims to identify and regularize operators delinquent in their payments. Officials urge affected business owners to report to the case AMC offices to settle outstanding fees to avoid further enforcement.
