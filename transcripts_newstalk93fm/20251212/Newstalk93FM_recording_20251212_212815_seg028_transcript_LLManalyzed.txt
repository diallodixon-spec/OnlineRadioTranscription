20251212 212815 I tell you that we all need love Jump up and show me love My bed with my head to the ceiling See I'm drowning alone and I'm lost in my feelings Somebody send me a sign cause you know that I need it Can't even come back to me cause you know you're my healing I said it's okay, it's my time
