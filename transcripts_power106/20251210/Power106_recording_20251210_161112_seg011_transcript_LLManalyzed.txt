because PAAC meeting is keeping. Yeah. So I was saying to myself, wow, we're in quite a rush this morning. But there are no journalists present at the press conference this morning either. So no questions asked by the media apart from two that the minister said, minister Vaughn spoke to this morning either. So no questions asked by the media, apart from two that the minister said, minister Vaughn spoke to that question in his presentation. So there was no attempt at even reminding us what he said to answer that question. And the other having to do with some matter of no great consequence really. Which I found to be quite strange. You know I need probably to ask around to my colleagues in the media landscape.
