20251226 194227 If I could, I'd catch a falling star To shine on you so I'll know where you are All the rainbows in your favorite shades To show I love you, thinking of you. Write your name across the sky. Anything you ask or try. Cause you're my coming one. You're the one that I've been waiting for forever And ever will my love for you keep growing strong
