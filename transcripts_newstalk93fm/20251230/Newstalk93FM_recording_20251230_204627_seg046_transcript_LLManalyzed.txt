20251230 204627 But now the sky is all for light Oh my Lord, never met no one like you before You had to make your own sunshine And now the sky is on for light This is just a storm inside a teacup That shelter here with me, my love Thunder like a drum, this life will beat you up This is just a temporary speedball But failure brings freedom. And I can bring you love. Love. Love. Don't you sweat it, baby. It's all right. You were dancing through the light.
