20251217 131816 service before I got there of light and internet everything was good. I mean the under part water is good and I feel sorry for the people in Manitoba that still have no water, Simon. These are the things that I think we should be talking about more. We know in the hurricane zone there are people within the city limit and they still have no water. That's not acceptable. Not acceptable, why? I think we should have backup generator at the pumping stations. I told you already they do have backup generators but they can't operate all the time or provide the type of service that would normally be there when they when the pumps are fully operational. Simon there are people with no water, they don't have no water, they make it none and then and then they have people going around selling the water.
