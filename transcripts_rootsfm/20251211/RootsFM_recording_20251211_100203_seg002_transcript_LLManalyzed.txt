============================================================

I'll still see the first. I give thanks and praise. For life, you know. I give thank and praise to every living thing. On the face of the earth, in the heavens, in the seas. I'd like to give thanks and praise for all human beings, you know, that you have created in your image and likeness. I'm the present, I'm the present. Give thanks to plants and animals which are a beautiful part of your creation. Give thanks to the elements of life.
