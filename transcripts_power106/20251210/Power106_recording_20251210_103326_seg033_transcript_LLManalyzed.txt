You want lower rates. You're lowering the rates. But then you have the inflation side of things. And if you're going to stimulate the economy, we expect higher prices. And with higher prices, then we're going to come on higher use. Otherwise, we're going to be making losses. And therefore, you see use moving higher. And that's a natural take. We're going to offset the markets, because investors will say, well, equities, equities, the cost, the interest rate, interest off cost is higher. When you're discounting assets, then you're higher rate that will lower the value of riskier assets. Therefore, you're going to have a natural second place where higher yields now will cause equity prices to fall. And the wealth effect in terms of the smaller groups, wealthy people who account for a huge portion of the market, and of course higher income groups accounting for the bulk of spending, at least 50% to top-end income earners, that might have an adverse effect.
