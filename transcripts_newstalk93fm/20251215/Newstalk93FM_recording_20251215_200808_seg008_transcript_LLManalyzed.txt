20251215 200808 You've been to a party Plenty women looking so nice We must be in paradise When last you had a time to remember His olive and butter fender And the drinks got gone, they got diva tender Who come with the money, come with the honey Who come to dance and dingole? Pie come with a cooler Milk a bit loud, yeah, we come to vibes and elevate No, it's not a mistake When the girls see we, they just wanna participate J bring down the soaker, bust up the speaker Cause it take the stress away On the left, on the right, there's so much pretty girl Fitting in the carnival with a bag of green on me like a criminal But if a wine on a girl see the team all the wrong way And we're having a good time, yes we're having good time Do you remember the time we were talking about the very first time When last you've been to a party
