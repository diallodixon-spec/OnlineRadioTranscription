============================================================

I see things out of order and I can't stand this Some care for inner pain, yes, that is so tragic But don't bring your father down, that's a bad of it. Leave your sister in a piece. Please stop it. Trust me, try your best. But you're not getting on my head. I'm just a he's and all I'm is. Yeah, I'm just a all I made. I'm just trying to live my life. Me, I watch what's on my side. I feel take care of I move at night Don't have no time for no gas, gas, vibe No, no, it's how I move But just the way I can move Can make me rock and move
