============================================================

I owe to you. You're my end and my beginning. Even when I lose, I'm winning. Because I give you all of me. And you give me all of you. Oh. How many times do I have to tell you even when you're crying you're beautiful to the world is You're my muse, my worst distraction, my rhythm in blues. I can't stop singing, it's ringing in my head for you.
