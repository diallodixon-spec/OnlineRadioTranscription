20251223 170301 That's according to data from the Jamaica Constabulary Force. Speaking in the Senate on Friday, government senator Apkefitz Henley said 2025 could mark the first time in 31 years that murders fall below 700 and the first time in 28 31 years, Jamaica is on track to record below 700 murders in a calendar year. Indeed, murders in Jamaica have plummeted in 2025 by over 42%. I believe as well that it is only right that us lawmakers extend our congratulations to the police, also members of the Jamaica Defence Force, who have put their lives on the line daily in 2025 to ensure that up until Wednesday of this week, a whopping 435 fewer people in Jamaica have been murdered this year when compared to 2024.
