20251224 215533 Hopefully you can last all night Don't get too excited Privacy You ain't gotta go nowhere You can stay inside it Can you blow my mind? Set off my whole body If I give you my time Can you stretch my soul from me? I don't wanna wait Don't take it Take me where I ain't been before Can you blow my mind? Set off my whole body, whole body. Make me sweat, make me hotter. Make me lose my breath, make me water. Make me sweat. Make me hotter.
