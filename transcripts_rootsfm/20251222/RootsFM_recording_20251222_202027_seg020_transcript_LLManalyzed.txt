20251222 202027 You're getting busy like a bee and that's the truth I got a feeling there's a fire I'm so wiggling just a little bit I wanna see you wiggling Just a little bit as it grooves I bet you're moving your body from side to side I bet the groove that you're hearing is keeping you satisfied. Dancing by yourself is bad for your health, so grab a cutie by the hand and tell her that you want to dance. As it grooves, you feel the tension in the air and now you're hyped. You're getting down because the sound is just your type GM and DOS is kicking it to your right So come on, come on, party hardy all night And wiggle it just a little bit I wanna see you wiggling just a little bit
