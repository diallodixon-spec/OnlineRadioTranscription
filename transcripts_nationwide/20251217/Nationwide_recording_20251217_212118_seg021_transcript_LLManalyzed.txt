20251217 212118 I'm doing great. Well, for me, I always had a thing for cooking. I have a lot of family members that cooks, run restaurants. So for me, it started when I wanted to basically just create an Instagram page reviewing food and kind of took off from there. So even from reviewing to food photography to content creation and catering also. A little bit on the side. Fireside Kitchen. I'm sure that I've heard of this. I was sending it to my producers earlier that I don't know if I've eaten it before or so, but it is so. I don't know, Fireside Kitchen, what is this about?
