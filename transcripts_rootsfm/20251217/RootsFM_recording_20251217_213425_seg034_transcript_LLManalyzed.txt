20251217 213425 This ain't a movie y'all, no fairytale conclusion y'all It gets more confusing every day Sometimes it's heaven said that we head back to hell again We kiss then we make up on the way I hang a up, you call, we rise, and we fall, and we feel like just walking away. As our love advances, we take second chances. No, it's not a fantasy. I still want you to stay. We're just ordinary people. We don't know which way to go. No, we're just ordinary people, ordinary people.
