20251230 164722 the best way to start off the year with family and friends and it's like the whole garden so far the family chill spot just to remind the patrons that the time to come is uh gates open at 10 a.m and it goes on to 7 p.m the earlier come is the more fun you have in my opinion because then you get to go on more more rides and the um the place is not as packed early in the day yes and you get a get a better experience. So that would be my recommendation to anyone. All right. Amazing. I know it's going to be a whole lot of fun and it's going to packed and the children and the family is going to enjoy themselves because we know that we still have some family members who are from abroad and they might look, you know, a little place to go. So if you have the house full of people right now and you're wondering where you need to do our where can you go? To entertain the children. Well, look no further Funfest is where you should be on Thursday and you can get for start early early early So you get some rest to go back at work Friday. All right
