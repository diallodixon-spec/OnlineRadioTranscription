============================================================

Give me pause cause me bring in the sauce Can't trust people now cause them wearing a mask People life, they palm price, nothing to cost They use them loss, it's top crime, that is a task Whether raining or it's sunny, you better have your money Then you face them all go down in life shorter than a trolley And the breeze and the rain but it get so deep I'll just clean them dirty and mucky Liar and thief, them a serpent. Won't get them clean with detergent. Try to make you walk in, cause it's urgent. Send them your faffies, they go purging. Cause it hurts when your friend them turning. And them hypocrites, man, you a preach like we never learn in a school.
