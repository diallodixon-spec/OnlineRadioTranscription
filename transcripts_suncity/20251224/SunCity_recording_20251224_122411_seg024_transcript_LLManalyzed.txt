20251224 122411 I just go with the trade wind blows, sending love to my friends and foes. And I suppose I'm pleased to be feeling in the West Indies to provide all my wants and needs. I got the sunshine, rivers and trees, believe me When I see John, I see your way Just take a list straight from the prophecy I say Every man to them own a philosophy I live the proper way and let me read a chapter daily Man, the inner city hungry, I know it And food they don't have country, just a drop off and they treat them. You see, poverty no real then, is what the rings didn't reveal then. Who knows? Who knows, who knows, who knows? I just go record trapping blows.
