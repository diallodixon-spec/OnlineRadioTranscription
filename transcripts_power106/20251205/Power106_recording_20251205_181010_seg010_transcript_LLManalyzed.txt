And of course, Mute Mile Day tomorrow at Gamana Spark, and as usual, I'll be taking a look along with Desmond at the 10 race, 11 race program, in fact. And we'll be focusing, of course, on the Mute Mile. Very, very interesting indeed. We shall see what happens. And also, big news there as well, is that Anthony Babineone, his former three-time champion trader, has prospects, his fans are telling me, of dethroning the great Jason Lacosta, both second-generation trainers, both Benjamin and their dads, really, really great racehorse trainers. No question about that. All right, we'll get into that in the end of the while. We go to a short break. When we come back, Mr.mond Lewis will speak to us right here in studio at broadcast house 32 Lindhurst Road. Stay with us please.
