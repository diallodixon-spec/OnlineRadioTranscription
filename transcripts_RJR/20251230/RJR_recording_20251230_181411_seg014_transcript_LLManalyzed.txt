My lasting tribute would be to him is something Leighton just touched on in that he was always seeking to get better. And even if he did a promo, he would listen to it over and over again, never really satisfied with the end result. And the other thing, I called him up maybe last year, I think it was, and we talked a little bit about his football commentary and where he could tighten things up and get it better. And he was just receptive, even though he'd been in the business 20 years, he was receptive as we all should be to input from others. And that, to me, is all about the lasting work.
