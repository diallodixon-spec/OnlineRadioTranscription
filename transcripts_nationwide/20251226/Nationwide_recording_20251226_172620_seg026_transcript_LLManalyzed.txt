20251226 172620 Over you I can see the love shining in your eyes And there comes a such a sweet surprise It seems believing is worth the wait So hold me and tell me it's not too late We're secret together We're starting forever now And I miss you like crazy I miss you like you're crazy And I sing to win away Every now and every day I miss you like I'm crazy I miss you baby Love like I'll never be Just like the end of a game
