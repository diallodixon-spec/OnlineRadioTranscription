responsibility for our own safety because the JCF, as hard as you try, you just can't be there bodyguarding everyone. And even the JCF members themselves have to maintain this level of vigilance because when criminal elements are out, they are out. They don't care. Right. And traditionally, you know, too, that this time of year we had more police presence on the road. So you will see more police in public spaces to include your bus parks, your commercial districts, your business districts, your shopping districts. And we want you to know that we are there. We are there to keep you safe. But at the same time, we want you to help us to keep you safe by, you know, maintaining your vigilance, staying alert, not overexposing yourself, nor ignoring the security measures that enhance your safety.
