I know the form say I too righteous. Look on the form say you too like us. Me no get the time for the hate and the bad energy. Cause my mind don't mind money. Me, make you dance like Bogoli. Steady green like broccoli. Steady on my grind, you hear what they want Telling me good in my fantasy They want to check if my tap ain't no rum But did they rush? Did they rush? Why will it be much? Not gonna make my tap, did they rush?
