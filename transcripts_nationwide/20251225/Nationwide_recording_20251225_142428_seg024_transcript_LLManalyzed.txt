20251225 142428 I look inside at these two balls of desire And no wire I can't beat my heart I see the sky, I feel the flames of desire DJ Jerome, I shall bark Ready, we know love wants to start No more playing around, no more waiting around for the special one to come No more wearing the crown, no more tears coming out, once I know what I want And I want what I know is you Nobody has to tell me it's war, it's you, it's you You're the reason I'm so mad and in love It's you My body has to say so It's you
