============================================================

Keep it until you get to the nearest bin. This waste management tip is brought to you by the NS at Newstalk 93 FM. My name is Conor De Bruyne, they call me the fireman. We go up until 12 midday. We're in the final hour of the program and this hour is sponsored by our friends at Kenmore Manufacturing Company over there in Spanish town, Greendale. All right, I have a few things that I just want to get out of the way before I go to the call. So, Colin, I'm going to ask you just to exercise a little bit of patience for me, please.
