So last week we spoke to Dr. Nichelle White who is a urologist and she spoke about where men can go for screening and the different types of ways men can get screen to find out whether or not they have prostate cancer. So this morning we're going to be speaking now on prostate and beyond. This is life after treatment. So just, you know, you find out, a gentleman find out that he, you know, has prostate cancer. What's next? What does he do? And Dr. White is going to speak more on that. Good morning, Dr. White. How are you today? Morning. Thank you. I'm okay. How are you? I'm good. How was your Christmas?
