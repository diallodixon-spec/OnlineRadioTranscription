20251212 155837 I know better, it not easy Time testing but I'm strong With love on my mind, love in my thoughts carrying on Why nobody no believe in a love again? Because every love that lost Nobody no believe in a God again Seems our faith is lost Nobody no believe and it hurts more Turn the lights on, the world's so dark, still I believe That love is everlasting, yes I know, love is everlasting
