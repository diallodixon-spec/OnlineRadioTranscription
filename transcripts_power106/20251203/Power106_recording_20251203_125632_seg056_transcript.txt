David, good afternoon. Good afternoon to you and your team. Thanks for the opportunity. Well, I knew I would hear from you when it was announced that there is what, groundbreaking for a new place in, what is it, Lionel Town? Yeah, Money Mosque. Money Mosque. Your Scottish name place. Indeed. Yeah, I miss that you weren't able to be on the whole team, you know. But there's still room. I think you should have a talk with Jesse and invite, telling him that he should try and make a whole day broadcast from down there. Okay. There's enough interesting topics to talk about. And it would be so nice if you could arrange that they speak with Monimus in Scotland at the same time.
