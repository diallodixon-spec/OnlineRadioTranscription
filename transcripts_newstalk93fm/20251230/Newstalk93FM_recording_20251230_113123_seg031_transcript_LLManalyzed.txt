20251230 113123 We talk some business, you know, I want your company and it's nothing too risky Hey, hey, hey You don't like the fast life But look on the bright side, girl I go take the blame I just want you to come and rise it up Just a little whine there now Come and meet me at the end of the truck and we rev it up Say cool day Keep throwing it back at the way you stopped us Baby, no way We could boast of all the pictures you want, when you're ready. I could over here, lolly. You could over here. But we could meet in the middle and start a bacchanal. Play in the middle, hey. What we gonna do now? Jam to a rhythm and eat a carnival.
