20251226 200806 That was your Sabbath school nugget with Pastor Robert Wright. This is NCU 91.1, 91.3, and 91.5. Ooh There is one thing I know That he loves me and so I'll exalt And I'll praise his holy name Oh, he'll be with me every day And and he makes my burden light. Said I'll go where he leads. Yes, I'll go. Go where he leads. Well, I'll go, where he leads.
