20251222 192713 Yes, we did. And I would like to also really, really say a big thank you to our sponsors. We had WB Farn, we had Cookie's Nightclub, and we also have Andrew Davies. He's an entrepreneur from Bull Bay. So we were very grateful to have them partnering with us to make this tournament a success. The first staging, and it was indeed a success. And thanks about that. Oh yes, we'll be having our closing ceremony and it will be on the 28th of December and it will be at Cookies nightclub and we're expected to start at 3 p.m.
