apartment but the will that they found that apartment was not bought by her yet and I was told that it was left for someone and I said how could she leave it for someone when she didn't own it yet because they have to use the will that they've found well okay so if if we if we are now dealing with future property that the person didn't own at the time that they made the will, if there's a residual clause in the will, then the legatees for the residual estate would get that gift. If there is none, as my friend Ms. Ingrid Cole mentioned before, then no, that falls falls into intestacy. That aspect of it, if there's no residuary clause in the will, then that future property that was never mentioned, never owned at the time the will was made, that now falls into intestacy,
