20251217 204522 Here comes a brighter day, here comes a brighter day And though it seems the clouds won't break I know the sun will find its way And we keep smiling through the rain Through the pain every day Knowing we will OK. You've been hurting for so long. And all you can do is hold on. Just when it seems like there's no end, here comes a brighter day. Here comes a brighter day! It comes about again It comes about again Comes about again
