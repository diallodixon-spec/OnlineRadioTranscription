20260102 110206 and his truth. The struggles you and I are facing today are not because the scripture is unclear, but like so many personal challenges, are the result of sin and rebellion. So today, let each one of us examine our own heart, ask God to reveal to us where we stand, and make the decision to trust His Word and walk in His truth. On behalf of our pastor, Rev. Mark Dawes, I wish for you a happy and prosperous New Year. I am your host, Donald Blake. May I invite you to join us again next week? The preceding feature, A Word for Jamaica, was brought to you by Grace Missionary Church, 7 West Avenue, Kingston 8.
