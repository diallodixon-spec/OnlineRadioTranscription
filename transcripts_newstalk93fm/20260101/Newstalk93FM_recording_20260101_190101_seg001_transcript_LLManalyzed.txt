20260101 190101 So deep. So, so, so, oh, so deep. Ooh, ooh, ooh, thing. A love is all I'm bring. Come on, pap, bring me the lyrical sling like King David. And rhythm like this not play with love A long time on the DJ in a dance A long time on a chant in a dance I come from nice up New York I come from nice of Jamaica But watch a drek dance all say love
