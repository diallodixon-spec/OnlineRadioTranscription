I was not built to break I didn't know my own strength Found hope in my heart I found the light to light my way out of the dark Found all that I need here inside of me oh I thought I'd never find my way I thought I never lift that weight I thought I would break I didn't know my own strength And I crashed out, and I tumbled, but I did not crumble I got through all the pain, I did know my own strength
