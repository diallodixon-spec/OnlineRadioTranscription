soul to soul. Right now I'm in England. You're listening to Roots 96.1 FM. Someone is having a birthday today from the Corbin Gardens community and of course I was told to call this individual about his birthday. As we say good afternoon, talk to me, is this Gary? Yes speaking. Are you Gary, Mr. Hudson, correct? Yes sir. I was told about today and it's a special day for you, is it? Yes, sir. And why does it happen to be a special day for Mr. Hudson? Well, because today is Mr. Hudson's birthday.
