Last night, all the shades were pulled and drawn Way down tight, from within the dim light past To silhouettes onhouettes die, oh Silhouettes Silouettes Silhouettes silhouettes die oh Put it's arms around your waist And held you tight Kisses I could almost taste In the night Wondering why I'm not the man whose silhouette's on the shade I couldn't hide the tears in my eyes
