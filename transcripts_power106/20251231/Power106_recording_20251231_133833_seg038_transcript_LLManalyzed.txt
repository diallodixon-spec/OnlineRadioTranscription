20251231 133833 Hello, good afternoon, Simon. How are you? I'm pretty good, thank you, and I hope you are well. Yes, I'm well and wishing you all the best for the new year. All right, so I'm calling. Yes, thank you. I'm calling because recently I visited two of Jamaica's, well, Kingston's known green space, which is the Emancipation Park and the Hope Gardens. And when I tell you that this has nothing to do with the management of the park, because many mornings I drive by and I see them doing an excellent job at cleaning the park, you know, you see the gentlemen with the leaf blowers and keeping the park clean. When I went to the park, the amount of bottles and cups and plates and you have the vendors out by the front which, you know, everybody wants to make some sales during the Christmas.
