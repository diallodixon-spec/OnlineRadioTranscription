20251216 102724 I'm going to go to a multilateral head start. Central Bank Governor Richard Valls has finally listened to sound advice and changed the predictability of the intervention sum from US$30 million on each occasion because it had no shock or impact. We know that the bank intervened in a foreign exchange market with US$40 million this morning and hope that he continues to listen and employ more creativity in the conduct of monetary and exchange rate policies. These are not normal times and as a result the neoliberal dogma cannot work. Right we have to be more creative at this time and I'm saying what the inflation number is telling him is that we have to rehabilitate the agricultural sector as quickly as possible because the devastation took place in the agricultural belt. Food and drink is 35% of the weights in the basic basket that is used to measure inflation. So we have to find creative ways in order to drive agricultural output.
