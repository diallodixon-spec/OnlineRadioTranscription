20251229 182412 I hope you well, I hope you live I miss your touch, I miss your smell, I miss your lips You can grab a drink, maybe grab some food, don't miss you I know it's hard, but don't, don't have no glass I had to protect my heart, and build the wall so tall I couldn't look over, I need to touch you One more time, one more time I'll take you one by five, not on the wireless And though you said not to call, you didn't miss you And I hope I can see you one more, didn'll miss you Baby, baby, baby, baby Ring, ring, ring, ring up the song Ring, ring ring, ring ring up the song
