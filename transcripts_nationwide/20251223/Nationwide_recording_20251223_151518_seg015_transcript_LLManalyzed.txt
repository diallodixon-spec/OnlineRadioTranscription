20251223 151518 If I should die before I wake It's cause you took my breath away Losing you is like living in a world with no care, oh I'm here alone, didn't wanna leave My heart won't move, it's incomplete If there was a way that I could make you understand But how do you expect me to live alone with just me? With my world revolved around you It's so hard for me to breathe Tell me how I'm supposed to breathe with no air Can't live, can't breathe with no air It's how I feel whenever you ain't there Don't end in no air Got me out here in the water so deep Tell me how you gon' be without me
