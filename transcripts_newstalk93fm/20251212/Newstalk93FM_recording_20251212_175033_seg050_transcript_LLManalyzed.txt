20251212 175033 One day without your loving and the rest I get seasick Not even be for when me sick can heal it Loving when you give me complete dis and need it Deep as the blue sea, your love's flowing into me And even though the waves are rough, this love is tough Just love me now Deep as the blue seas, deep as the blue seas Love me really, actually And even though the storms will come, no we won't run, just love me Deep as the blue sea Nice and easy, so deeply We submerge under this emotion Like an anchor, you keep me safe I'm not afraid of the ocean I'll keep you warm and cosy You'll be coming on me arms When the storms approach, it's a wife on me. When all goes things like the tides on me, the lighthouse we are where I fall in. Deep as the blue sea, your love's flowing into me. And even though the waves are rough, this love is tough, just love me. Darling, that's a wrap.
