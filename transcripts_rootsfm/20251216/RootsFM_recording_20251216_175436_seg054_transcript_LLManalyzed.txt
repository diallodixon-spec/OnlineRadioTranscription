20251216 175436 But all this year's been a busy blur Don't think I have the energy To add to my already mad rush Just cause it's distance season The perfect gift for me would be Completions and connections left from last year Ski, shopping, counter, most interesting Add us number but never the time Most of anyone passed along those lines So deck those halls, trim those trees Raise up cups like Christmas cheer I just need to catch my breath Christmas by myself this year Count the picture Frozen landscape Chill this room for 24 days Evergreen sparkling snow Get this winter over with Flashback to springtime some again would have been good to go for lunch couldn't agree we were both free we tried we said we'd keep in touch din of course till summertime out to the beach to his boat could i join him no this time
