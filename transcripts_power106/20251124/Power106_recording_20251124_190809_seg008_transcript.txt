Vice Chairman of the National Road Safety Council, NRSC, Dr. Lucian Jones. And occupants of vehicles are also being cautioned to wear their seatbelts properly. This means securing the lap belt and shoulder belt across the pelvis and ribcage. It is important that the shoulder belt be placed across the middle of your chest and away from your neck and the lap belt should rest across your hips and not your stomach. You should never ever place the shoulder belt behind your back or under an arm as this could cause serious injuries in a crash.
