============================================================

Please hear me Lord. Give me a heart like yours So much grace So much kindness So much faith Forever true Strong as the wind, soft as the shadows If just once I could be like you A heart like yours is my desire. A heart like yours, it's my desire. Heart like yours is what I'm searching for.
