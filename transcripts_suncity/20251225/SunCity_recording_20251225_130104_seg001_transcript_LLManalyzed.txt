20251225 130104 I tried to deny it, but I'm still in love with you. I miss you like crazy. I'm missing you like crazy. Ever since you went away, every hour, every day. I miss your like crazy. I I can see the love shining in your eyes And it comes as such a sweet surprise It seems believing is worth the wait So hold me and tell me it's not too late We're so good together and we're starting forever now
