20251216 123721 Can we reduce the risk factor of catching the cold or the flu, especially during this time where it seems to be more prevalent? It really is. Weather change has increased your risk. Around this time of year, it just tends to be a lot more risky. So you can wash your hands frequently with soap and water. You can disinfect surfaces, especially if those surfaces are being touched by say children who have the flu and they're running around and touching everything. Disinfect surfaces, avoid touching your face. Cover coughs and sneezes. I would recommend wearing a mask. During this time, yeah? Right. Yeah. And also putting a mask on persons who are around you who don't know better. We're going to be around all the time and if they're coughing or having sneezing, avoid as much as you can, too much close contact with someone who is sick. Even though you love them, don't get too close. Stay away from me. Right? Healthy social distance. Yes, yes, yes.
