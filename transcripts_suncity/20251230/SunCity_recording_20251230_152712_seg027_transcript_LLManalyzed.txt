20251230 152712 Come to Jamaica, the land of beauty Where life on the beach feels like a movie Take a trip, touch down, if you're feeling groovy We party every week, how we love to party We will rise above the hardness of the times Even though sometimes the hills are hard to climb Let your light shine Let me see you light it up We are diamonds in the rough Voices so loud, can't be denied Across the world, our lives still shine Together we are, one people One country, one chase Spreading love everywhere
