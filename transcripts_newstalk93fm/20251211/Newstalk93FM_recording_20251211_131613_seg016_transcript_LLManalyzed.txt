You're listening to Sleek Radio, 93 FM. It feels good to love somebody And somebody loves you back But it feels one sided now It feels one sided now You don't have to return about it Cause it's crystal glad now, now Guess it's bye to the good times I'll be gone by the sunrise I'll be better on my own I'll be better, on my own
