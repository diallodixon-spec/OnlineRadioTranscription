20251222 115642 I had to run out of Westmoreland. I refer to myself as a girl from Grangell. That's where I grew up. And I had to move out quickly after the hurricane to come back to Kingston to get a generator, to get back to my community. And when we bought that generator, phone persons were my neighbors. Even today, they are still charging their phones and their various devices so they can operate as close to normal as possible so it has been a journey has been a journey and what I want to say on behalf of the credit union as well and also personally let's not forget let's not let's not make this be a one nine day talk as we say as Jamaicans let's even this holiday season remember the people who need the most. And let's see how business can reach out to them and just help somebody. It doesn't matter how simple it is. All right. Thank you so much. And you're the good Katrina. You're not the Hurricane Katrina. No, no, no. Not the Hurricane Katrina. Not the Category 5.
