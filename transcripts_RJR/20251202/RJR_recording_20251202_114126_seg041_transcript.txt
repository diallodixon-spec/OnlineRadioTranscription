And then if I drop back down from the Premier League until you left, other players made it. I don't understand how is it that instead of us doing the same thing, marketing, because we have tremendous talent, market our players through the international scene all over the globe. Now there's a very lucrative league developing Middle East. Why aren't we marketing these young talents rather than bringing important persons who are already employed in the British system? Because the only country whose players are not chased after by the La Liga, the French league, the Dutch league, the German Bundesliga, etc. Portugal, etc. All the English ones, you know, you hardly have any of them being brought outside of England to the Italian league, and etc. So why with the talent that we produce?
