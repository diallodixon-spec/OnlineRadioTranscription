20260102 180604 I don't know about you, but I come here to fight. Come to play a mask I'm not leaving until I wet Come to play a mass I don't live my life with regrets, no I come to jam on a bumper Come to drink out the liquor Until my head's gone and I'm miserable All down on the ground, I'm causing trouble Look how these security watch me They don't know I'm out there I just smash a big place under these fat legged jumbies And to one way, they don't want me in their party day They don't want me cause I do one way
