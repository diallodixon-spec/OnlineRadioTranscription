Considering that we got a category five, something that has not been experienced before in the Caribbean, and that we were able to restore over 80% to get power to most customers who had lost electricity. That is significant. And the reason we've been able to do this, Dr. Taylor, is because of the partnerships. Now, you may recall that we brought in almost 70 line workers from foreign and had them here before the hurricane hit so that we could start work on restoration immediately after the hurricane. That has never been done before, but it was a strategic move that our leadership decided on.
