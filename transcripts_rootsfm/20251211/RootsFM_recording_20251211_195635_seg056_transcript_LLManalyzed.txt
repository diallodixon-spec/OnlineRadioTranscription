2025-12-12 06:46:08 Though I never laid a hand on you My eyes adore you Like a million miles away from me You couldn't see how I adored you So close, so close and yet so far My eyes adore you All the life I will remember Though I never let one dream come true My eyes adore you All the life I will remember Though I never laid a hand on you My eyes adore you I never will end there Like a million miles away from me you couldn't see how I adore you For the feelings I'd regret so close I know I won't ever forget you but you're the one My eyes adoption. Though I never lay a hand on you, rise, adoption. Like a million boats away from me, it's good to see how I adore you.
