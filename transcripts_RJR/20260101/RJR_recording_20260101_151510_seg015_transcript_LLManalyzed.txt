20260101 151510 The JLP wins the general election. We must guard against arrogance. And Jamaica back on top. Seville from Thompson! Lyles at last is beaten! The Rated Jamaica News Center presents the 2025 Year in Review on Friday, January 2, 2026 at 5 20 p.m. Right here on Radio Jamaica. This is 94.5 FM. All right, we are back going to be playing this clip. I think this happened in March with JC Lodge and we're playing clips from interviews we did back in 2025. This one was fun. Hope you enjoy it.
