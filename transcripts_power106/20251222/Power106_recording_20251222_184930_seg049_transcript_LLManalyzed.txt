20251222 184930 in a predictable way. I'm going to talk about some of these young fighters. What did you see? What stood out? Canada's been doing very well with the female fighters of late. Our male team has been suffering up here in Canada and we've been doing quite well with the females. There was actually a Canadian bronze medalist national champion that fought a female from India, actually, which was a fantastic battle. There's also a Canadian heavyweight, I think, of Russian descent now, very skilled. So there are some prospects coming out of Canada for sure in the near future getting ready for the next Olympics. Hopefully we can have a better showing than our last couple. Yes, that is very good news, talent emerging, and that's what you're about, Tyler, I'm sure.
