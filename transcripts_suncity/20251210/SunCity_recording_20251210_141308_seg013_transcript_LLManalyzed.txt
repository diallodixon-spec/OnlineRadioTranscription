And I believe that love is a powerful thing, a feeling deep within. And if you believe in love, free up your mind, let this go within. As early as the morning star sun I'm giving thanks for this lovely day Girl, you got to beat on me hard, beat on me hard Me pray that you woulda never part And now all the girls, they hold me, hold me, Hold me so tight, yeah, baby Don't let them never please me so Treat me so Lord, you feel so No, girl, never squeeze me, squeeze, squeeze, squeeze me so tight, yet, baby. No, not them, never groove me, sir, groove me, sir. Girl, you shine so bright. And no, never hold me, hold me, hold, me so tight yet, baby.
