20251223 192218 Everything about you frees me. I relax and take it easy. Cause you give me hope, hope. You're like the morning sun and I'm not alone. You give me hope. Hope. You're like a sunrise. No, I'm not afraid Cause you give me hope When I walk on sinking sand Feeling lonely in a crowd When everything's pulling me in every direction You're my anchor, you're my solid ground All I'm searching for a fight Your medicine for my mind
