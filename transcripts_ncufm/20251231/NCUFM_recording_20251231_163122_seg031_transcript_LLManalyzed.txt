20251231 163122 place over a long period of time. It tells us whether a place is generally hot, generally cold, generally wet or generally dry. For example, Jamaica is hot and sunny most of the year and this is what makes its climate tropical. Climate is important because it helps people plan their activities, helps us to know what to wear and to understand which crops or plants will grow well in that area. So let's revisit that conversation, the difference between weather and climate. So weather is what's happening outside right now. Yeah, get up, go to your window, look outside, go to the door, look outside, step outside. What's happening right now? That's the weather that you're experiencing now. It could be sunny, it could be rainy, it could be cloudy, it could be windy. Climate on the other hand is the pattern of weather over months and years. For example, it might be raining today but the climate of Jamaica is hot and tropical throughout the year.
