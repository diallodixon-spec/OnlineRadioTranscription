But these people, it's bugging me to think that they are so bright. And people like me who is very ignorant in terms of education and not going to any of them big institutions, but I have common sense and God help me can read and understand. It's not important to read and understand. So I understand a lot of the stupidity that they are pushing on the people and because the masses of the people, since it is all stupid or dumb, that they accept it or either they accept it and just accept it, knowing this is wrong and are upset.
