There's a big yard, low plain corner, from low plain corner to Arran Street, a big building there, which is called Derry Farm, as you can tell. And one day that big building looked like it ought to come down there, at Charles Street and Arran Street corner, because they have areas that they need work. So me know I walk, I. I have the big shopper, come and get the money. Well, what I'm going to say is, alright, what are we going to do? Right? We're going to call you up several times, even send me a picture of them and so on. Yeah, I'm going, I'm going to send you a picture of the money. I'm going to go to the head of the organization. We'll see what we can do. You guys don't have on. You guys get full of shit. It's going to take too long now. I can't say no excuse for that. You can have quick fatigue, but not quick to full up. Alright? So we'll try and get to the end of this here and say listen what's happening here. Put down the contact and just get the excavator on there. You have this tendency sometimes to hear things that go down one ear and go through the other.
