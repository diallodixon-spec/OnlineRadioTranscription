20251217 132318 Can you name me three food groups that most Jamaicans eat at least one of these food per day, every day? Can you name me them? Chicken, rice, flour. Thank you. Which one do we produce totally? Chicken. Not totally. The by-product comes from overseas. Yeah, well relative to flour and rice, so we're asking which one we produce here more, it is the chicken. Right, totally. Okay, we produce chicken in Jamaica, but the by-product is from overseas. Corn and sorbet. The by-product? That's not the by-product of chicken. A by-product is something that would come from chicken which would be wings, legs, doo-doo. Oh, you mean to grow the chickens. Right, right. Not the by-product. Sorry, my bad. Oh, gotcha.
