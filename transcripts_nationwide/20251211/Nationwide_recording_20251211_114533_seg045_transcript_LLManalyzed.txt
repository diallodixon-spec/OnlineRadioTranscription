Oh, yes, and and and and the election day brother joe i'm tyrone i keep on calling the judge and election day When I hear when I look at the clock and I hear about 3.30, somewhere about there going to 4, I hear your station announced that it was only 30% percentage of people come out to vote so far. And by in the night I hear George, I think it's George or one of them, said on the panel that on the close of election night, it was about 41 point something percent. So I am asking you, George, because there are so many things that were said about the government.
