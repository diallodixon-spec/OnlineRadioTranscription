20251219 142515 I don't know if I'm going to make it up. I don't want to go with Jamaica. I don't see the dollar if it gets you. I'm telling you not to leave Jamaica. But watch out, man. On your proper style, go on a down seat. On your proper mix, you go on a business. See how you sell road, how you sell regular. Man, how you keep your business. Man, they I don't. I'm sick. Good life to the man who did your rubada. Talk to the man who gave your rubada. Jumpin' nice off the party. I've got a nice hook, a nice love. But what's your man? Nice off the dance. Dave, pass your love. Promote your understanding of the law. Move along. Promote your understandin' of the law. Hold em' loud.
