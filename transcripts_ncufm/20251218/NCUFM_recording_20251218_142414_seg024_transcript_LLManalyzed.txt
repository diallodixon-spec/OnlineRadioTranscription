20251218 142414 Come feel my life, I am incomplete. Let your love rain down on me. I need you more, Lord, I confess. More of you and nothing less. Come quench this thirst, Lord I am ready. Here I am waiting. Come fill my heart. You are the only one who can feel me. Here I am waiting. Come feel my heart.
