20251215 140002 I left you for months on end. It's been months since I checked back in we're somewhere in a small town somewhere Locking them all down wood grain foreign change armor roll down. I can understand why you wanted the boss now So I can't let you know it problem. Let me show it but tend to be heroic That's just one to grow it but deep inside it. So say the time is now 2 p.m. Coming down my eyes, so I gotta make this song cry. Don't repeat the CD of bigs, me and my b----. Watching Barney and Clyde pretending to be that empty b---- in your hand sand. Let me see that b---- shopping sprees, pull out your visa quick. Had very bad credit, you helped me lease that whip. You helped me get the key.
