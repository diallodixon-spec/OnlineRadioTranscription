20251229 095745 Gonna listen to me I know better It not easy Time testing but I'm strong With love on my mind Love in my thoughts carrying on Why nobody no believe In a love again Because every love that lost Nobody no believe In a God again Seems our faith is lost Nobody no believe And it hurts more Turn the lights on the world so dark Still I believe That love is everlasting Yes I know Love is everlasting I believe Love is everlasting. I know love is everlasting. Love is everlasting.
