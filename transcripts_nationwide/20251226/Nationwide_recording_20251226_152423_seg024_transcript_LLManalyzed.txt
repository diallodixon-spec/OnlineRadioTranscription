20251226 152423 I'm wondering when it's gonna come nowhere to stay You may have got your heart broken a few times In the past, you're never as strong as you used to You don't feel as good as you used to before And all the things you used to say, things you used to do Went right out the door Ooh, no more will you be the one That's what you tell everyone around you But you know they've heard it all before What more can you say? When love won't let you walk away You can't help all your love And you find yourself giving it all away When you think you're in love I wouldn't be the one who you believe in Your heart is in gossip from heaven Never peace on me who leaves when you don't because you're sick Gossip from heaven I wouldn't be The one who you believe In your heart is in gossip From heaven Cause never peace On me who leaves
