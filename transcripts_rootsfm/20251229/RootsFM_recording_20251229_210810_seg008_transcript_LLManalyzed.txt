20251229 210810 I've even tried to forget But nothing can make me I know that it's so hard to be true Under summer skies I'll write your name in my book At least a thousand times And every day you're away It's driving me crazy So I'll ride you every night And I'll sign my name love always And even if the sun falls down, I will always be around for heaven and earth.
