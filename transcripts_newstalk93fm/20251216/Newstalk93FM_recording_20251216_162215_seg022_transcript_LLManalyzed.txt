20251216 162215 If you're not a friend of me, enter the light. Cause you can never kill my vibe. Go ahead with no sacrifices. Everything was taken, still had to make it. Vibe killer, me and you go take a vibe killer. Somebody can protect my energy from your bad aura. Let my pastor say, I be my healer. Everything I desire, I go deceive. My rhythm, flow like a river. If you get your work, come on, go and sit down. I go just para, come out my jigger. I go just play, follow my lead. I'm feeling vibes on vibes. I'm taking dynamite. I blow your condo lights. You know I'm just that type. No, don't think you my vibe. Don't think you, my vibe. You don't think you, you don't think you. You don't feel my vibe. I see you watching my stories I see you gaging my lifestyle I see you watchin' my movements This bad, bad every day I know the look on your face Bad man, bad every day
