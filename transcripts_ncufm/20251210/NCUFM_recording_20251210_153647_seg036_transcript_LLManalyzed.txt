I see. So yeah, when should you seek medical help? Parents should contact a doctor or visit the hospital right away if your baby is under three months old and has a fever. If the fever is above 105 degrees Fahrenheit, if the baby has difficulty breathing, if there's a rash, especially if it spreads or looks unusual, if the baby is very sleepy, unresponsive or not feeding, and if the fever lasts more than 48 hours. Also, if the baby has a seizure, look out for that. But most importantly, what I would say to all members of my drive time family, trust your instincts.
