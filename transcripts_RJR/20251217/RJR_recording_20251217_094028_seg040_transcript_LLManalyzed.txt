Well, if it is that you are engaging someone, normally you would ask for a quote. The quote that they provide should state exactly what the items are, what the service will be provided, and if it is that there are things that you do not agree with, you can negotiate where that is concerned so it can be changed. If you are uncertain about what has been provided or unclear, my suggestion, if you have someone who is more knowledgeable or if you can engage a lawyer, that would be good. And you say, don't pay the money upfront.
