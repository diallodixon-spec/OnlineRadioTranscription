20251218 162313 you know R&B that doesn't you know pop is a fast it's fast it's much much faster it's something that you dance to and jump up to I'm gonna understand that's not R&B that's that's pop you understand so I think that also kind of confused the younger generation you know what I'm saying the younger you know singers and producers they're like okay I'm gonna make some R&B songs now and then when they jams R&B and love songs and stick to pop music being the fast up-tempo upbeat. Go on Spotify, go on YouTube, go on Apple Music, type in R&B music and trust me, you're not going to hear not even one slow jam, none of them not slow. All of them fast, right? And that is just a lot of confusion for upcoming artists, you know, and producers
