20251230 092819 I remember Mr. Sweeney came out indicating something, that's what I recall. But as to what's happening Now what else we don't do? Cambridge people don't turn worthless who want road and water for a good day. All right, all right, all the best. All right, good night, bye-bye. All right, we're short of people taking a break. You can see the pain is real. And it is when you go through these things on a daily basis, I love to hear what's happening to the water door up by Cambridge. Because if it's, I know he indicated that he has heard about a pipe also being busted.
