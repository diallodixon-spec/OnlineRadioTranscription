20251219 202317 For the past five days, did you check on me? Now did you look for me? I walked in the room, eyes are red and I don't smoke banga Did you check on me, now did you notice me? Nobody will know the paranoia Cause I put a smile on my face A facade you can never face And if you don't know me well, well, well You won't see how buried I am inside my grave Inside my grave Cause you see people, people, people People don't really know you They don't know you Cause you see people People, people I've been drinking more, all for the past five days
