20251230 173923 Look at your body slow when I slow down Put it on your load, no go loud damn You know the things I wanna do tonight Unusual Put it down, me got to carry your piece of mind You go flow like water, we get it freeze up black Open your eyes and look Look what the hot body can do. Can you see your hot body coming? I say, look, look, look. Focus. Look what the body can do. Body be dancing. Snow white, so my body so fine. Like push from the mirror inside. To want and the mirror inside. Makes sense, oh, makes sense. Oh, my God, I need his distance. Make sense, I need for my distance. Make sense. Oh, make sense. Look. Look what the whole body can do.
