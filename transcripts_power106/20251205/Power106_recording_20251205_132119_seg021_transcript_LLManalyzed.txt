With due respect to Chief Currie, I'm sure if the Prime Minister wanted to force the issue, he could. Well, that's it. And then imagine if the Prime Minister decided to go in and rebuild or do what they feel like. Wouldn't this become an outright civil war in Jamaica? I don't know if it would. Well, I guess it would qualify as that. I think respective leaders have paid a certain level or degree of respect to what the maroons established and what they did and so on. But really only to a certain level. If you push it too far, then you would feel the force of the state within your so-called state. So I think most Jamaicans do not accept that the maroons have an independent state within Jamaica.
