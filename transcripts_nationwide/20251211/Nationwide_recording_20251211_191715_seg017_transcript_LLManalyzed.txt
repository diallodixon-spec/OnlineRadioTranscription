I'm surprised you said it's leftist liberal. I wouldn't expect it to be a very conservative approach. It is not a conservative approach at all. What would be the conservative justification for the state stepping in? The tradition of conservatism. You know, stepping in and telling me what I can access online. The religious conservative argument, so to speak. I'm still not moved by that.
