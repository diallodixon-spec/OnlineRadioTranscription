20251218 091715 they dug up the road to address leaking issues that they have and so that's the reason for the traffic according to what we are being told that work should have been completed by 5 a.m. this morning today but that is not the case so here we are expect once again major major delay if you are heading in that direction. I made a joke with Kimberly in the car when we got to NHT. I said, those people are getting to work until 12 o'clock because the traffic was barely moving. As a matter of fact, when we were coming in this direction, we did not expect any traffic on that side. And we're saying, wait, what? We didn't expect this at all, because usually in the mornings, the traffic is going in the other direction, people coming into Kingston. But yes, we realized that it's because of the single lane traffic that they reduced the Spanish town route.
