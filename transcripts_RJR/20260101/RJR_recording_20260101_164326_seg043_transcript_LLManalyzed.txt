20260101 164326 I ain't alive! Sink, Sink, drop on me, oh, some. Fill all down the sink. Sprinkle my mattress with naked soda. Pick it off the chink. Wash my clothes with me honey in a washpan. Man, no washing a sink. That's how me two bugger come out the door. That two stink. Wake me, wake me up, just a little. Life of a change in the eye of a bleak. Don't make them trick your son with their fake brain And then the day again, everyone extinct Because you deny them nothing good Ooh, rise up and sing them a song to me Make up in my head, no sir Take your manner, don't give no robber Life's too good, a clean life to render come to me. Ready, ready, ready anytime you need me.
