20260101 124625 These dreams go on and close my eyes Every second of the night I live another life These dreams that seem to be outside Everyone I'm loving, I'm awake The further away I'll be Is it cloak and dagger? Could it be spring or fall? I walk without a cut Through a stained glass wall Weaker in my eyesight The candle in my grip And words that have not fallen, falling from my lips These dreams go on when I close my eyes
