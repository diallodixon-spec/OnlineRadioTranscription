20260101 122220 Hello. I hope you're good, I hope you're well, I hope you look good. I miss your touch, I miss your smell, I miss your lips. You can grab a drink, maybe grab some food, don't miss you. Call my mama, baby. I know it's hard to know, don't act like one. I have to protect my heart. I built the wall so tall, I couldn't look over. I need to touch you. One more time. I'll take you one by five. Not on the wireless. And though you said not to call, you didn't let me shoot. And I hope I can see you one more day when I miss you. Baby, baby, baby, baby. I love you.
