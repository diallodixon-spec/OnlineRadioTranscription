============================================================

I miss your touch, I miss your smell, I miss your lips. Maybe grab a drink, maybe grab some food, don't be ashamed. I know it's hard, but I don't have no glass. I have to protect my heart. I built the wall so tall, I couldn't look over. I need to touch you. One more time, one more time. I'll take you one by five. Not on the wireless. And though you said not to call, you didn't miss you. And I hope I can see you one more day when I miss you. Baby, baby, baby, baby
