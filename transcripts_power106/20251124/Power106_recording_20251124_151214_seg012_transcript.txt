============================================================

If you're a tenant in common, then you know an estate either has to be probated or administered, and that takes a while. So it really isn't in terms of cheapest, because what it comes down to is the value of the estate. Of course, if it's matrimonial home, as I was saying before, you're not going to have any estate duties, so you would only have legal fees. So it all comes down to the value of the type of property and the value of the property. If you are considering owning property and you want to know what's going to be the easier method in terms of removing a name in the event someone dies. When you are a joint tenant, once someone dies, you do an application to note death. That process is shorter.
