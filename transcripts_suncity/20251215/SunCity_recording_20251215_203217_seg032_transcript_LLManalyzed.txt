20251215 203217 from our donor, which is Global Affairs Canada. We have partnered with H&L Agro today, as well as Growers Choice, and your ever-present RADA Extension Office. And the idea is we want to help you to get back into production as quickly as possible. World University Service of Canada Country Coordinator for Jamaica, Nelson English Johnson. The recovery kits were tailored to farmers' immediate needs and included cabbage and pak choi seeds along with pest, disease and nutrition management supplies. We have put together a crop recovery kit for you guys. So essentially it will entail two seeds and you will get all the inputs, so the pest and disease management, the nutrition management products that you will use, that you will need to get that crop going. So in six to eight weeks time, you should start getting back some money in your pocket, right? So we're here today just to remind you that Woos Caribbean is always in your corner. SAC Project loves the farmers of St. Thomas. We stand with you
