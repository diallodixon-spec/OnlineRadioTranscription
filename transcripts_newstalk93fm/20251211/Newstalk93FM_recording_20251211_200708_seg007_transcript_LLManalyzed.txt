2025-12-12 14:14:53 We're not feeling under the weather You just make me feel sweet Ice the cocoa tea, use the sugar And together we are complete, darling Heat me up Only you alone can put fire back in the soul Heat me up And you're telling me I should leave that fire alone I can never let you go. I see you again all day through the night are dreaming, yeah. Where you turn it up, make it smooth, my darling. When outside is pouring rain. It's over. Raise the temperature higher.
