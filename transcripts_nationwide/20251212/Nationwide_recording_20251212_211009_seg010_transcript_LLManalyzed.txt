20251212 211009 properties are recovered so we are expecting that there will be a stutter that would take us perhaps as far as mid-year and so some of the properties will not be ready and consequently may have to look at varying options in relation to staff arrangement. Where that is to happen we have the full undertaking that the Director of Operations at Rio Hotels, Frank Sundern, says the entity is providing care packages to staff. What we want to achieve with that is that you can take your mind off of getting food and giving beverage. You can focus on rebuilding your house instead of being hunting down with supermarkets and only can pay cash and so on. And the staff was really appreciative.
