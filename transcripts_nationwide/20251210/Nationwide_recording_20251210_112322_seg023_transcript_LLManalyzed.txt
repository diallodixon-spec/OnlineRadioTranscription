This smile came out of that because as we were going through different communities and talking to Jamaicans, we saw, you know, lots of resilience, lots of gratitude despite having to endure hardship because if you know one thing about Jamaicans, we're going to smile. We're going to find our reasons to laugh about things, even when things are not ideal. And we asked ourselves, how do we find a smile initiative work? What will people have to do? From now until January the 24th, customers are able to win a share of over $30 million in cash and prizes. So we look at, again, trying to meet our customers where they're at. How could we reward them for doing the things that they do every single day in a way that is meaningful, accessible, and relevant to what is happening now? So we're giving 64 customers $250 million.
