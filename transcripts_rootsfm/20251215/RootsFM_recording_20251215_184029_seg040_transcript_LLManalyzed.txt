20251215 184029 We can't get too much, too much, oh, too much. Cause anything you sing these days, I originate it. But pirates, they might come and say, ah, they might imitate it. Because they might come and tell me, Hugo said we wrecked you. And Friday evening, come and say, they really want to date me. Too much, never too much. La dee la dee, we out to party. Yeah, yeah, we got our people. Yeah, yeah we got our area, it's the night of each ascension. The lyrics of me mamas always have a word of caution, cause the right one where we have to be.
