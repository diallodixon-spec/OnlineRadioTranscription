Because only the fittest of the fittest will survive in this time mentally, physically, spiritually, emotionally, musically, magically. And of course, my nonchali-ali-ali-o, on this here Wellness Wednesday, it's already the 10th day of December 2025. It's Human Rights Day. Yeah, I tell you, man, what a vibe, what a vibe.

Jamaica. Mama Africa. Sierra Leone. Ethiopia. Zimbabwe. I tell you Sudan. Congo. I couldn't do it without you. I appreciate every minute, every second, every hour of your time.
