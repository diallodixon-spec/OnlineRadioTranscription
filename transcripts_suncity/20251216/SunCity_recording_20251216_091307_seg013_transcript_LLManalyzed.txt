20251216 091307 Blessings to all those tuned in. This is Devotion of the Stars with Mama Bee. My name is Bishop Joshua, and I'm here today to share my favorite biblical scripture. And I would have to always begin with Ecclesiastes 12 and 12, which reads let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter fear the most high and keep his commandments for this is the whole duty of man so when people ask me what is the meaning of life why is the world in this current situation why do we see so much wickedness and deceit in this world why do we see poverty why do we see people stricken with disease why are people confused and lied to why is this going on and it's because people don't fear God anymore I'll read it again let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter
