I hate the bias in the media, so says Henry. Yes, Henry, but you haven't defended Fable. You just said, I never hear you cut down Portia Simpson Miller. You realize she was last in office in what, 2011? Come now Henry, I'm asking you, you people keep cutting down Faber Williams. Please defend Faber Williams. Don't talk about what we are doing. The bias in the media and you think the bias only occurs over here and you think the criticism of Fable Williams and her performance is bias. You think that's evidence of bias.
