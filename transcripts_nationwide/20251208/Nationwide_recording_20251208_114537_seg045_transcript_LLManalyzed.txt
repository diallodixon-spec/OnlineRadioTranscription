I don't know. I don't want you to send me this year. I am asking you, if we had a Jamaican poster who went here and said, Rene Gonzales, Rene Rene Gonzales. Ralph Gonzales. Rene? Ralph Gonzales. Alright. You know which Jamaican buddy I'm telling that he would win? No, I didn't. I didn't hear of any Jamaican politicians went there to campaign for the party who defeated him. Yes. Mm hmm. Because I remember one time he came here and he was very active in the election in Jamaica that time. Yeah, he campaigned for the PNP here. Yeah, and one day he came here and said the GLP was flogged him and go, he means what now? He means what now? You tell me.
