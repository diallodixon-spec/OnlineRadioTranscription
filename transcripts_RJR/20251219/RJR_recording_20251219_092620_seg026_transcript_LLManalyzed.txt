Or you should build a proper seawall. If you're going to do that or something like that. So we have to understand that it's a multi-pronged approach, and that's why architects don't operate in a silo. We work closely with engineers, structural engineers. And of course, I'd imagine that in terms of the natural environment, otherwise, I mean, like the NEPA people, the biodiversity types of issues and all of that, movement of surface water, the hydraulics engineers and all of those persons work with you. Ecology is super important and if we keep building a concrete jungle we're not going to be absorbing the water that we need to absorb so it's really a combination you know sustainable architecture really is about that hybrid between
