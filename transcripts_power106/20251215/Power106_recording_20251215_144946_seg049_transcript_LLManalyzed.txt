Get reset at slbja.com or if you know somebody with a student loan, you can just send me a WhatsApp message and just say student loan and I'll send you that particular information. And I want to encourage persons, do not say you're going to put off your education because you don't want to borrow money. You're going to wait until you work some money to go to school. Get a student loan and get your proper education, become the teacher, the nurse, the mechanic, the engineer, the doctor, the lawyer, go and get your degree, take the loan, because I think there is something that, you know, a mindset as a people, and I think this is deliberate, where we have been programmed to believe that to borrow money is a shame, it's a sin and etc. So by the time we get the education and we look around, it's time to retire. Parents, send the children, if you can manage, send them straight from high school into university. Let them get the education behind them.
