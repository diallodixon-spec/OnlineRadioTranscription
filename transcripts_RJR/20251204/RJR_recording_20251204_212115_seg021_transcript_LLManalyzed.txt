We never should have been together That's the reason you're not here I know that I can do much better Not a single salty tear Not a feeling in my chest Baby, I'm feeling no stress I'm too far to be depressed Go on, girl, go on, girl Please don't worry about me, I'm fine Only gonna play the fool one time Trust me when I say that I'll be okay Go on girl, go on girl, go home girl Oh, please don't worry about me I'm fine Please don't worry bout me I'm fine I'm only gonna play the fool
