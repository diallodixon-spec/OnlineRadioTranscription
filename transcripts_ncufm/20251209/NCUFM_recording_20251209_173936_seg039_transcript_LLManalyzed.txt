for you what are some steps that you try to take to ensure that you use the internet responsibly in a safe way well before i post anything i have to take like a good five minutes to see if how it will affect me or affect someone else when it is posted because not everything is for the public something should stay private yeah right you never tell me that i post post a lot online, you know. But online, they know a lot about me. That's right. Right. So that's something that I always do, because as you were saying, when it comes to job, personally, I don't think your job should be nosy and looking to your personal life. However, I am trying to make a brand for myself and certain things I cannot post because if I want to work at NCUFM, I can't post that I'm going to some parties. They won't hire me. So you have to be very intentional in what you post. I see, I see.
