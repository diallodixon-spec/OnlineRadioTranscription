The major changes will see an adjusted deadline for entries to be submitted now January 15, 2026, and a pivot to virtual pre-competition workshops and virtual parish auditions.

Minister of Culture Olivia Grange said ensuring participation from affected communities remains essential to the JCDC's plans and this I think is just absolutely great.
