What was the damage like at Laconia Primary? All right, so at school we had devastation as well or admin building. The roof was completely off, so we lost a lot of our documents, our equipment, computers, printers, photocopiers. We would have lost a lot. So for us, it's vast devastation for us at school. Students' bathroom roof, we would have lost it as well. Fencing also. Fencing, our water drums, classroom damage minimal. We would have lost a lot of classroom resources, but based on what we would have seen, you know, in comparison to the other areas, we would probably consider that minimal for the classroom.
