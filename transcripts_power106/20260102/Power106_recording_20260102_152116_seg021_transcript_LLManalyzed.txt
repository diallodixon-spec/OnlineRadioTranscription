20260102 152116 I don't challenge the police, you know. I show them my two hands. My two empty hands, I see every day. That's what I do with the police. Show them my two empty hands. So, they'll shoot me. But if I show them my hand with a weapon in there, I will be gone. So, it's just reality, you know. So, I used to choose to go the evil path? That's his choice as a human being. Yes. And whatever him get, him get. So may not cry for him, sir. Choices have consequences. I get your point. Yeah, yeah. All right, Countryman, I'll leave it there this afternoon. All right, sir.
