20251215 092923 In the meantime, can I apply for a U.S. visa? You can apply but I'd probably say to you wait until you get your extension because of course you want to show U.S. immigration that you do have status in Canada. You're in between status right now. I don't know if the person was on a student visa and applied for post-grad or if it was just a work permit you have and now you're applying to extend your work permit. But I would say to you, just wait until you get the work permit extension before applying for the U.S. visa. Again, I don't know how long it also takes for you to get a date for a U.S US whether you get in an interview or if everything is processed online Opal would probably be able to answer that question so you could look at the timelines but I would probably say wait until you get your extension before you submit the US visa all right thank you so much for that
