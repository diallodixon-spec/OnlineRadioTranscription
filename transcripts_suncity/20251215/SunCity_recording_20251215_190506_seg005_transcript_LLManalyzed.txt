20251215 190506 due to the unavailability of natural gas in the period leading up to and immediately after Hurricane Melissa. The bills cover November's consumption. The OUR further explained that, among other things, the hurricane resulted in an approximately 30% reduction in sales, which contributed significantly to the increase in the fuel and independent power producer IPP rates. The OUR says together, these factors may translate to a big hike in the November bills. It noted, however, that to avoid shocking customers with one high bill, the JPS, in consultation with the OUR, opted to defer some of the increase in fuel and IPP costs and recover it by spreading it over the upcoming months. The OUR, in approving this adjustment, notes that given the scale of the disaster, it may take up to six months for electricity generation costs to stabilize and for energy consumption to normalize. Given the likelihood that further adjustments could cause bill shock to customers, the OUR has urged JPS to discuss the IPP and fuel charges before they are applied over the next six months.
