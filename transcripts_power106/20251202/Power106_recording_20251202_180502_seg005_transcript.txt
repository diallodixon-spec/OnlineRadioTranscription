============================================================

on this program and I say traditionally because this program has been going for a while but it gets to this time of year or into the month of December from day one we play Christmas music. Today being the first Tuesday of the month we are going to go to the country and western genre. We do that normally and in the month of Christmas here no exception. Brenda Lee with a remarkable song. Why I say remarkable? Because this song, the song you're going to hear today went back to the top of the charts in the United Kingdom last year. That's how extraordinary this song. Little Brenda Lee taking us back to the days when she invited us to rock around the Christmas tree.
