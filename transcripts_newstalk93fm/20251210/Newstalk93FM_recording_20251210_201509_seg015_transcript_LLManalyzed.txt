I know the way that you bring a vibe With your hands them up in the sky Rollin' back and havin' a time We ain't like me again And we haven't money to spend Yes, we jammin' down to the end See me with me carnival friend Love me carnival friend Where she come from there London, how she come from there New York, how she come form there When you come in my baby How she come form there Atlanta, she come form there Toronto, she come from there And I know that you miss me I love the way that you bring a vibe With your hands them up in the sky Falling down and having a time Wine in season again And we have the money to spend And we jammin' down to the end Runnin' with me cannibals, friend Ah, me cannibals Friend, friend, friend, friend
