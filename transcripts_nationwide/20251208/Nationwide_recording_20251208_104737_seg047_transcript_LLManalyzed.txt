for a long time to get the power back on. So my appeal to the public, members of the public, the unscrupulous persons who are damaging and preventing us from continuing the work, my appeal is please don't do it. It's selfish, it's careless, it's irresponsible. It is also criminal, frankly. More than irresponsible, it's criminal, it. Yeah? You know the situation we are in with so many people without light. Yeah? And JPS go on. They are making every effort they can. And you go and destroy that. Destroy light poles. Tief the the the power lines. Come on man. And any anyone of us who see that happening should report them to the police. Because not until you catch them, yeah? And deal with them, yeah? You're going to send a very clear message. It's time for your calls.
