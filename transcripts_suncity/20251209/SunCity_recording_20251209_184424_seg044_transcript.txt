Who said that? Who said that? What's your name? Type your name for me, please and thanks. If I chew your talk, type your name, because I don't understand how you just talk and hide.

I'm from Kingston 20, so I know how my brothers and sisters are from Dweni Park, Brook Valley, Sherlock to be specific. So when you say you have some mama's boy from Sherlock who don't even know football, water, red, a bear, red flag, I don't know about that. I don't know that one. I can't confirm or deny that one. All right? Can't confirm or deny that one. Fat a fire over there in Chicago, got it locked in, big up yourself. Shout out to Sonia over there in Garden Pen. Big up yourself.
