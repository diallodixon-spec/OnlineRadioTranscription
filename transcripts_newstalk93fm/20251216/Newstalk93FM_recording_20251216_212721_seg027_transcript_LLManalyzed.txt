20251216 212721 But I can't get over it You left and never said goodbye Those tears I cried, no, I can't over it So don't you ever let me down again Cause I'm depending on you So you better come through this time please hear my cry and if I ever let you down my friend it was a misunderstanding so we thought you'd get forgotten don't know promise from today I go drunk like I never drunk waved like I never waved whined like I never won before just to show you I'm sorry, I'm sorry and I need you back in my life Look at people by the truck Emotions running high We are not in the sky Just running down with high Can't you tell that we sorrow We sorrow
