20251219 181509 And they have all been washed away Into the sea of forgetfulness You've placed all of my sin I'm the one who keeps reminding you Over and over again Into the sea Of forgetfulness As far as the East from the West 70 times 7 You've forgiven me And you keep cleansing me And placing my sin Into the sea of forgetgathering air. It's your unfailing love that causes me and all my multitude losses. It's your steadfast love that keeps reminding me I'm forgiven.
