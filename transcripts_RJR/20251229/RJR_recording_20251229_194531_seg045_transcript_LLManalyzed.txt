20251229 194531 Despite the challenges 2025 has brought, especially in the last quarter, the year has given the Bureau of Gender Affairs, BGA, much to celebrate. Among the considerable gains made over the past year include the formation and sitting of the country's first sexual harassment tribunal, the creation of the first-ever gender strategy plan for the justice sector, and the review of over 80 workplace sexual harassment policies. Not one to rest on their laurels, however, as the year draws to a close, the Bureau has shifted its focus towards galvanizing stakeholders across the island to ramp up coordinated actions to safeguard women and girls from emerging forms of digital violence. The Clarion Call was issued at the Bureau's inaugural Gender-Based Violence GBV Advocacy Forum, held recently at the Jamaica Pegasus Hotel in New Kingston. The forum formed part of the National Observance of the International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women, IDEVA, and the Extended 16 Days of Activism campaign.
