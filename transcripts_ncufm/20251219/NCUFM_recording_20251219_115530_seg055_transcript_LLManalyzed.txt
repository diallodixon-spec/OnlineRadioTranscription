May today god, someone who is discouraged, who is heartbroken, who is grieving the loss of a loved one, who lord would have just learned of a of a terminal illness, someone father who is believing that all hope is lost.

And indeed you are our soon coming king. Guide us today Lord and into eternity we pray in Jesus name. Amen.
