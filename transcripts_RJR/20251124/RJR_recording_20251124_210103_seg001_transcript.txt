All right, indeed. Poor road's a major concern. What about those drains that are in need of repairs or cleaning? Who is responsible for repairing the road and when will it be done? Join us this and every Tuesday morning at 8.45 during Sunnyside Up as we travel on our roads with the National Works Agency and get answers to these and other concerns. You're welcome to visit their website at nwa.gov.jm. See the tender notices links for projects to be undertaken
