20260101 181008 Let you down, my friend. It was a misunderstanding. So why don't you give it back then? You're not promised from today. I go drunk like I never drunk. Wave like I never wave. Fire like I never won before. Just to show you I'm sorry. I'm sorry. And I need you back in my life. Look at people by the truck. Emotions running high. We are not in the sky. Death running down we hide. Can't you tell that we's time to bless the Lord. Come to me, come to me. Come to me. This is my apology. Follow me.
