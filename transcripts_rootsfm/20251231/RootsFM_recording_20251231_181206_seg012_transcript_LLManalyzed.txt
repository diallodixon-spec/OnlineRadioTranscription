20251231 181206 who saw my distress and responded, bringing hope and peace, my heart now mended. I've paid my dues. Now I'm an overcomer, walking in victory. Please let me be. I'm out of my misery. Now I'm living my purpose. So can you, only if you're willing to pay your dues. I have paid my dues. What a strong message. I hear the rhymes. Yes. But the message behind the rhymes is a very strong one. Pay your dues. So in this message, I'm interpreting now, this message, nothing comes without some pain and suffering. Nothing good comes without some pain. No pain, no gain. And you know, I always tell someone, tell people that you have to face, you have to get some of the rain before you get the sunshine. Right?
