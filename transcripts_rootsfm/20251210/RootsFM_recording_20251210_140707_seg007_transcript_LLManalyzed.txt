Maybe together we can get somewhere Anyplace is better Starting from zero got nothing to lose Maybe we'll make something Me, myself, I got nothing to prove Whoa, yeah You got a black star I've got a plan to get us anywhere Working at a convenience store Managed to save just a little bit of money To the city you and I can both get jobs and finally see what it means to be living.
