And it's nothing too risky Limited liability Don't worry If you try all the things I like You could still be shy in the morning So don't feel away You don't like the fast life But look on the bright side I go take the blame I just want you come and rise it up Just a little winding now Come and meet me behind the truck and we rev it up Say cool day, keep throwing it back I know why you stop baby no
