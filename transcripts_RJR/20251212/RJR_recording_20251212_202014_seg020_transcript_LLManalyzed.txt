20251212 202014 I feel no pain, yeah How me jumpin' up all day, yeah When these spirits that hold me We gon' need for a Monday We gon' need it for a Tuesday This road know my secrets This road know my pain Cannibal is stealin' baby Back and I like to take my bed This road know my secret This road know my bed Cannibal is stealing baby Smoke and music in my bed It's in my bed, it's in my bed And we not tired no way Tell them it's in we bed Never going back to home Stars up above Let we dance now Take a a chance now, with me I'll make a jump till morning Look the moon don't sleep in
