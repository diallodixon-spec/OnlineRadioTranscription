I'm not saying Jesus is a bald head, but did he have long hair? There are some depictions of Jesus Christ without long hair there are but but you know the majority of those depictions They are of a man with long hair I know for example in the publications of the Jehovah's Witnesses Jesus had short hair short woolly like here. Not long, straight here. I know that for sure. You also say I wonder at times how much of what we read about the past is fabricated and we don't dwell on the future.
