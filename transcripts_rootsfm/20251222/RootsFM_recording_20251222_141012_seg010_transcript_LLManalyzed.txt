20251222 141012 Don't let it flow, let it flow You'd better let it flow, my baby Don't nobody want no drunk heart Don't nobody want your two-time loser My baby Don't nobody love you like you are Till it takes whatever it'll bring your way You deserve respect but you can demand respect when you change the island. Comes a time when we could go around, way down. So let go, let go. Let it flow, let it flow. Let it flow.
