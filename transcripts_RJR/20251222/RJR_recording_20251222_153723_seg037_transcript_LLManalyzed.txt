20251222 153723 Look out for the things that will trigger you. For a lot of persons, the Christmas season is very emotional, emotionally draining, because this is the time of year when they're dealing with a lot of their loved ones. I mean, we just experienced a category five hurricane, and a lot of persons this year would have lost loved ones. I mean, persons in Central Elizabeth, Shillong, Westmoreland. I can't imagine what they might be going through. And also, you know, you don't want to overcommit yourself during this period either, because you have to incorporate some health care, ensure that you are mentally, emotionally and spiritually well. So I guess maybe a lot of times myself and people like Deli will be burnt out for the Christmas and we don't even realize that.
