someone there and really approach young student with that man. He just told me something was off. Look at the child looking distressed. I saw the picture of the uniform. I said, yeah, man, that's the person. That's a young lady. And if I had, when I accosted him and it didn't turn out to be him, I did have a problem because he would have to still answer to the police. If it turned out to be a man going about his business with his child, I would have still stopped and inquired, you know, who is this child to him, you know, because some of the time we see these things that we just hate no mind and just think it's just a normal living occurrence happening in society.
