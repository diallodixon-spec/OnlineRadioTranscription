20260102 164831 If God built this building, then be sure it was sand. So many say they're Christian, they're following their own plans. Day and night they labor, but they're building on the sand. They trusted in religion and doctrines made by man. The church was built from Calvary Cross and on that rock it stands. If God built the building, be sure it will stand. He placed it on a cornerstone that never will give way. Guarded by His angels, stripped down by His hand. If God built the building, then be sure it will stand. When Jesus built the building, He made it firm.
