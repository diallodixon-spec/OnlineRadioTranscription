20251223 153519 Christmas, my friends, is not about the commercial activity. However, it is that you can bring joy to someone this Christmas. It could be that you are going into a community and you're able to feed even one family. Trust me, it will make a difference. It will make a difference to them. And you know that even in those communities that have been devastated by Hurricane Melissa, there are parents who are still making an effort to bring cheer to their children. They're not stopping to think about themselves. They're stopping to focus on the needs of those children and making them feel special this Christmas. So we want to encourage you, if you can, to be a part of a system that is showing that you love and care about others.
