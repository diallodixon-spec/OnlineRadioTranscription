============================================================

May I pray and ask you, O Lord, to lift up this man's mind and emotion to you. When pressure rises and strength fades, renew him with your power. Guard his thoughts from discouragement and from the pain that he face daily. Guard his thoughts from discouragement and help him process pain with grace. Let your spirit restore what stresses him. Fill him with peace that surpasses understanding and resilience rooted in their promises. Righteous Father, I pray that this man who is listening right now will walk in integrity in both public and private places, shape his heart to love,
