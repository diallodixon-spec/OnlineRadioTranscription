20251224 204733 Christmas is coming and the boys is getting fat Someone say that you must try not to drop a penny in the old man's heart And now don't you think about that now that Christmas is coming Someone say that the Christmas is coming Girl don't run, breathe out the oil and let me take you by the end and lead you to the land So that, don't come back drill and stone. You're the one for this young Christmas. Come on and lead to hear the angel's voices for night divine. O come, all ye faithful.
