Everyone of them gets station bail. Station bill, not even bill to prevent all of them have the ability to run away out of the island. And not even a $500,000 bill, station bill. Well, that's my take on it. Am I taking on all other major issues like that? Including one that's been in the courts now, I think adding up to six years.
