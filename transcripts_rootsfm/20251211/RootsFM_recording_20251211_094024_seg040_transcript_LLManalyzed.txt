She wants to go for a ride Next day we go to Elsha Going to Screechie We order food and then we sit down and are easy Till she hear the music and fling her shoulder To how she going to hold that piece that she already has Oh, when you are part with we A good time is guaranteed Fill up your vibes and get tired Tonight we a go touch and party Oh and when you a part with we a good out of ten.

This is the whole constitution.
