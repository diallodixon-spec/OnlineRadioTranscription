Tell me where you need it for rent. School fee, tuition. It is all on me, but I beg you, please. Please don't hurt me, mommy. For Why? Please don't break my heart. After all, it's the truth for you. Still true to you. Great need for me to feel. And I know these words ain't new to you. A long time, I beg you, please. Don't you take my love for granted. My love for granted, girl. For granted. Don't take my love. And anything that you ever wanted, it's yours. Access granted, girl.
