Said that you'd never leave me, we would fight till it's due But as it went on, I was fighting for you Said the text had turned green, why the fuck it ain't all the way Don't ask for all your things back cussing out my name yeah just to go and take back what you say burn all the bridges don't ask for forgiveness walk away like i'm someone you hate don't let me
