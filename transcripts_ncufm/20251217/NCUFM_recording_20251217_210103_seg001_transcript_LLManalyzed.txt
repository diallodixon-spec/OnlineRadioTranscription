20251217 210103 and Pastor Robert Wright. Again, we thank you listeners for joining us. Today we're going to be focusing on the anger of the Lord. Father in heaven, thank you so much for your grace and your love and your mercy. As we study today, Lord, we pray that your Holy Spirit will guide us into all truth and help us to understand that though you're a God of love, you do get anger with sin and you do punish sin. And if we embrace it, we'll have to be punished and disciplined at some point. Help us to love shall come to pass that as all good things are come upon you, which the Lord your God promised you,
