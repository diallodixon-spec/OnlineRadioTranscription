2025-12-11 23:21:39 I am rich in love, and actually I'm a papa. It's just you that I'm after. Got a lot of love to give you, baby, and I'm not shy. I give you love, and I'm right. I am rich, and I love you, and I'm actually a papa. It is just you that I am after. I got a lot of love, to give you baby, just about everything That a man could ever say To me, to make me stay before Now I need more And don't bring me roses, bring me the food Don't bind me down
