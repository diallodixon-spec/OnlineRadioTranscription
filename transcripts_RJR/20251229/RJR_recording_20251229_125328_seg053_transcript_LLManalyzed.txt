20251229 125328 Oh, so you say no, you're not acknowledging the loss of time and the bill of most of the channels are gone. 10 HBO channels, all foul language on the shows. I choose the channels I want when I sign for the service. No new channels. And you can't tune in to see anything and a new bill, 8,000 plus for January 2026. It is crazy. I'm in the Keystone area of St. Catherine and they have a bold type federal customer. This one is not going away soon. Let me sort it out. Good morning, someone. I'm living in Burnt Ground, St. Elizabeth. We don't have any electricity, no internet and flow. They're sending bill to pay every month. Okay, so executives at these entities, you have to address this. I'm not the first, though. Issues like this when Hurricane Beryl passed. People need to understand.
