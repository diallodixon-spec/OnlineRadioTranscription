============================================================

Just give me one more shot inside my glass and love where we from. We get these powers from the same nation. Sweet like steel, drop the sweetest vibrations. Don't let the rhythm get you just run, run, run. Even you could handle it, German. But like when the man pull high, we go rip it up for spite. Oh, lord, goodbyes and party, we love it. Sweet woman, we have it. Greatest on the planet, boy. Somebody radio loud playin' a song and it's goin' over. And if I lose myself inside this place, well I'll show my shit.
