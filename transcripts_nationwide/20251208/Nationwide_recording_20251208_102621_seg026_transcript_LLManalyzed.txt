rumors here but the rumors if you're following this are quite you know let me just say there are several rumors and speculation about what is happening in a compound and possibly why curry doesn't want the JDF there. And I think, and I hope that the Jamaican security forces have heard what we have heard and others have heard. I heard on the program this morning with Tauna and Saundre, one of the members of the community, they are saying that the Jamaica Constabulary Force members need to step up and do their work as policemen and women in the community.
