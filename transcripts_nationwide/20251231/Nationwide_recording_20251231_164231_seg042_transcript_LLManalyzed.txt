20251231 164231 I never could keep When I look into your eyes I know that it's true God must have spent a little more time with you I'll be your dream, I'll be your wish I'll be your wish I'll be your fantasy I'll be your hope I'll be your love Be everything that you need I'll love you more with every breath Truly, boldly, deeply, to do I will be strong I will be faithful Cause I'm counting on a new beginning A reason for heaven, a deep enemy I wanna stand with you on a mountain
