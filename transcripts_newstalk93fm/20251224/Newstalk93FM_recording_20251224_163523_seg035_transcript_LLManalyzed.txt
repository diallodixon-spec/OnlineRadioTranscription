All talk and massive take a joke. But life is started by the joke, by the joke. Play we started by the joke. Party on the road. There's a party on the road. Light it up, light it up. Bring the shots and light it up. Party on the roads. There's a body on the road. Look at lights in the back. Watch hands up in the air Wave them up in the band People from everywhere Welcome down to the land of the party We love to party Cause life is to be livin' and we livin' it Our hands is to be givin' and we givin' it So don't be late The truck head and car waves We are team to sell
