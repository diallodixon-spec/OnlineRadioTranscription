20251229 113827 Thank you. Things I could not understand Many times and trials Weakness blurs my vision And my frustration gets so out of hand It's in I am reminded I've never been forsaken Never had to stand one test alone Just when I look at all the victories I'm reminded all that God's done for me Is through the fire my weakness hits me extra hard
