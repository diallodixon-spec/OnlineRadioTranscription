20251225 185140 Oh, I won't ask for much this Christmas I won't even wish for snow I'm just gonna keep on waiting Underneath the mistletoe I won't make a list and send it To the North Pole for singing I won't even stay awake to Hear rain this late. Cause I just want you here tonight, holding on to me so tight. What more can I do? Oh, baby, all I want for Christmas is you. You, baby. Oh, oh Oh, the lights are shining so brightly everywhere. And I saw the children laugh and feel the air. And everyone is singing.
