20251226 152625 Because you took my breath away Losing you is like living in a world with no end I'm here alone, didn't want to leave My heart won't move, it's incomplete Wish there was a way that I could make you understand But how do you expect me't live angry with no air Stop it whenever you ain't there Don't end, don't end Me, I't in the water so deep Tell me I aint gon' be what I made If you ain't here, I just can't breathe It's no air no air No air, no air No air no air
