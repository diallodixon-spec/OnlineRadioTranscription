You're listening to Sleek Radio, 93 FM. Like the great King Solomon in modern day. I wish my wife and my sweetheart could be friends. And when we going on a date, you know, send me a bring the boat to them. The boat to them. I wish my white and my sweet heart could be friends. Uh, uh, uh. And when the tree are with the road, there's no problem. You see my wife, she like my sidekick. And you see my sweetheart, don't call her no sidekick. Imagine up in the house and we inside with the possibilities of it all.
