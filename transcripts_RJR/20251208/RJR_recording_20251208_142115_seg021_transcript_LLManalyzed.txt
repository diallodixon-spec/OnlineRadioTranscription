You know sometimes you think you're going through the worst and then you hear another person share their story and it puts yours in perspective, eh? Just reflecting on this listener sharing that she was diagnosed with stage four cancer just a year ago. And I'm just thinking, wow, anything else that you're going through right now that seems so insignificant compared to that. Really happy that you're doing much better, my family. Get tested, get tested!
