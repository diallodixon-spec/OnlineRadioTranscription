So the picture's not good, is it? Oh, you're so impatient. I'm making sure someone looks good. I want to post it to death. This look good, Kelly. AJ, I like this. It's him. I'm going to link it now. Pass me the bag for me. What are you doing with the condom in your bag? You want AJ to still use condom? Of course. I'm not taking no chance. The chance of one life I have, you know. I plan to live my best life. But I'm not your number one. No chance. Me and my number one. I want to govern my life on a level where I'm not afraid of certain things. Just wipe the tears of Tyga one more time. Me and Culture and Legend Thursday continue. Crying, crying, crying fool. Crying, Crying, crying fool. You cry cry baby, your moonshine down.
