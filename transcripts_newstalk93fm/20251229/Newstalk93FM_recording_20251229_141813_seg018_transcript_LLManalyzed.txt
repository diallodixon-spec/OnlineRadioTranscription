20251229 141813 Hey twin lock in, hey twin lock in. Hey twin lock in. My twin looking good, we so pretty in the mirror. And we get that back together, we like seeing some mirror. And we in hot demand, we the ones with the motion. Funnels on Brazilian, booty on Samoan. But you know we ain't finna say hi, if my twin ain't feeling your vibe. If my ass she'll lie, we don't switch sides, friend. We ain't like them, if he don't spin. We don't like him, spinning on 10. Counting up M's, that's my kin. We so locked in, ice went lock in Ice went lock in
