20251226 142614 Yeah. Life's rough, but I'm not trying to cope, I'm on my giant throat, and I'm going to be the one to kill me, the smart man of high hope. Bust the cage, I'm going to touch the stage and sing some high note. I'm going high for the family, them rock my boat. My father did a celebration like July 4th. I switch up on my thing, but I don't cry for guy's support. I switch off on my thing but I don't start with guy's support. Oh, Lord. Nothing more. Let's give a lot of snow, bring me dog, then pack up a tote. I never money, no watch, I'm a grub before. One side, give me blessings, I'm a count, I'm a lit high. Yes people, powerful words.
