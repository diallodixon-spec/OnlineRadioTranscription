Yes, we are one, out of many people And we know it's a good old ways to jump over evil We are going to rise and soar like an eagle Last year we called for a car, we need you God know it hurt me, we don't deserve this We look up at paradise, we're not going to desert it God know it hurts me, we don't deserve this. We look up at paradise, we're not gonna deserve this. God knows it hurts me. We don't deserve this, but trauma ties on me, I don't need therapy. Cause every time I hear my people cry, I hear my people crying. Love days of fooling me I am. Oh. Yeah. Yeah. Mm. Mm. Stomach, stomach, man. This is shit.
