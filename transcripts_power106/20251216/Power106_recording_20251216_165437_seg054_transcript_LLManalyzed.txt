And if you consider, I remember last time I went up to Havenvale, pretty much the houses had one family there, one family unit. Now, pretty much all the land space is taken up with apartments. So basically you have less area space for water to run off. So now all of that water that used to soak in the earth is now going to go on the road and go somewhere. And then when you have a situation where the gullies and all of that haven't been seen, you now, have the mass flooding and that's what somewhat contributed to Kettering Hall and West Green. A friend that was telling me that there are certain areas that certain buildings went up and so there was a big soak-away there. It's no longer there, it's no more building.
