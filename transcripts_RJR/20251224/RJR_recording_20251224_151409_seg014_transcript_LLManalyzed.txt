20251224 151409 special that is going on now with the Credit Union Access Plus Debit Mastercard for this season that our card holders need to know about. Anything, I'm just asking for a friend. There's no specific offerings available this Christmas. Nonetheless, we extend our warmest wishes to all our valid card holders and wish for them a joyful and festive season. Thank you so much, Cleon. And I'm hoping that with this information, all our Access Plus Debit Mastercard holders will experience stress-free shopping this holiday. Thank you so much for being on the show with us today, Cleon, and Merry Christmas when it comes. Ladies and gentlemen, vibes us. My guest on today's show was Cleon Brown of QNET Quality Network Co-Optiv. All right. Thank you again for joining me on today's show. I'm Katrina Grant, the Aglar aka Kat, and you know Credit Union Visors brought to you by the Credit Unions of Jamaica and produced by First Option Communication. The season is here. Christmastown is here.
