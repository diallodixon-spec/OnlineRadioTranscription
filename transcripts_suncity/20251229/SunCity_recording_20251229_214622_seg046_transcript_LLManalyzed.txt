Can't stay here when I bring you round. She put her lips on the **** and her wrist to work her tongue. And make me keep faster than a speeding bullet. Her love's stronger than a locomotive, but only for the F-A-B-O-L-O-U-S Sing to me, ma Baby, they can't play you guys out So be cool with my super powers Boy, I'm only human But I'll be your beautiful woman Baby, don't make me a girl like me No no, no Take a girl like me, she can A guy like you to understand All girls ain't the same, I'm not your average chick Cause they can do a lot bigger than I've ever seen
