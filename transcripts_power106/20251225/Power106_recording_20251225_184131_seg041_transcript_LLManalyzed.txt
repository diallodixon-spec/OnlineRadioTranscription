20251225 184131 Lost and alone Cold if it's only Memories of you I got caught up in all the lines I write Maybe it's the time of year With the northern snow, the mistletoes Maybe it's the Yuletide cheers Oh, I need you by my side You're the place I want to be I can't be without you Oh, without you If you're not here with me in December There are no golden nights to remember If you're not with me in December
