20260102 131713 We set up all these agencies, social security, and that and that. And yet we don't allow them to work. We allow the politicians, our politicians, to go in a place like the other. And I tell them which road must be repaired and that. It shouldn't reach the politicians. We are working agencies. In time gone by, you know, Simon, when you hear the government read a budget, and them say extra amount of money go to the Ministry of Work, sorry, the public works department. That money used to be spent by the technocrats, you know, we used to spend by now, MP, and get $10 million off each constituency and all the foolishness there, you know. The technocrats in the ministry supposed to know which road needs to be repaired, which route that needs to be done, and when that is not done, now the MP can hold those agencies accountable on our behalf. Not the other way around. That's how it should be going outside.
