2025-12-12 12:07:42 We sing this song, not as a song of desperation, but we sing it as a song of affirmation. Don't we all need a wonderful touch of Jesus tonight? All over the building, I want you to join with the choir. I want you to lift your hearts I want you to focus on the Lord tonight and sing this wonderful song that simply says I need thee oh I need thee Every hour I weep thee. Oh, bless me now, my Savior. I come to thee.
