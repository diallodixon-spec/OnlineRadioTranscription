20251225 161820 I'm out of your new situation This type of whole life Pop a nightly conversation And sew me lullaby Registration has reduced And me eggs well fried God me dwell clean From me socks to me tie She's a freak and so a lover That made me not be shy Feet express me sense just can't get over Girl, this separation can't get over Some things are right, can't be wrong, can't get over No matter how hard me try Right down on me, happy as the question, why? Feeling of me, now you're truly blessed
