============================================================

it was the same thing with my neighbors mm-hmm so yeah so you had a lot of wind because as you said the garage top gun and then this and then the water the roaring water the water came rushing in and it sounds to me I said like it all happened like now you're retelling it in slow motion but in the moment it must have all happened almost immediately for you. Almost immediately. So I was confused. We were all confused. I'm telling you that whatever they had in their hand or their babies or whatever, that was what they were. We were only just foolish things. If you didn't tuck away something, food was in the car and a few clothes or so forth. But anything else, we were confused Because we had to make a decision whether we were going to stay in the house and drown or we just want to left everything else. We couldn't move anything else. Life is more important. I'm glad you guys made that decision.
