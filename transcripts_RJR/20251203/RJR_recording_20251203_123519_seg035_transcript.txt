So, the Prime Minister the other day, I don't know if it was fake news or what, but in my talks, he doesn't like to see people begging all over the world, and people are running around on that. You understand? He doesn't like it because as far as me, I don't see anything wrong with him. I don't see no posts, no pictures, no videos where I'm going to work. I haven't started doing nothing yet, you know. And then, you know, imagine the people, they say, when they go for deliveries, like some things, they must cool down, they mustn't too much take too much picture picture. Why? Because sometimes you people take the worst pictures and then they, unfortunately they try to give a wrong impression. You know that that more time man? Yes.
