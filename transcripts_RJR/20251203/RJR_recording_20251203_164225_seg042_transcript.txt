============================================================

I was down, my dreams were wearing thin When you're lost, where do you begin? My heart always seemed to drift from day to day Looking for the love that never came my way Then you smiled and I reached out to you I could tell you were lonely too One look, then it all began for you and me. The moment that we touched, I knew that there would be two less lonely people in the world.
