20251229 213424 I'll never love this way again So I'll keep holding on Before the good is gone I know I'll never Love this way again Hold on Hold on Hold on, hold on A fool will lose tomorrow Reaching back for yesterday I won't turn my head in sorrow If you should go away I'll stand here and remember Just how good it's been And I know I'll never lie
