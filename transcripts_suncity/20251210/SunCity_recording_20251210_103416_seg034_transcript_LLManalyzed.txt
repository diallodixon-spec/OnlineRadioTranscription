============================================================

every Tuesday at 8.35 a.m. This feature is brought to you by the Ministry of Health and Wellness. Mothers, you are your son's first teachers. You shape their values, their attitudes, and their understanding of right and wrong. I urge you, talk to your sons. Talk to me. Son, be careful. Don't make me cry. I don't want to hold my baby or wipe the tears from my eyes. Make me a proud mother. Let me see you grow to be a man. This is all I ask of you. I hope you understand. Talk to your sons. Talk to them. Reason with them. Oh, from my old age.
