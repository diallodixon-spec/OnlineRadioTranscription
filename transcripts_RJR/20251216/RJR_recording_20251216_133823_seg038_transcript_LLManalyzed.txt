Can you imagine why we didn't get any bookings? Bookings turned lookings. It looked away. One time without a smile. Christmas time? Without a smile. Oh gosh man. Christmas time cause I'm nice man, all February I'm smiling. Christmas I'm talking loud because I said nobody can't give me no talk. Don't it? Yeah. All your girlfriends have me talk good to you, Christmas time. No, no, me afraid. Girlfriend have me talk. Hey, girlfriend talk nice to me, Christmas time. Oh yes sir man. What? Money I make. I say every joke. Every joke funny. Oh gosh man. Yeah man. Any request you make is a full fail man. Of course. Yeah man. You know what? I'm worried about this fish man. Well, I start to realize what's going on already. It's not a bad face already. Yeah. Simple request not being responded to you know. Yeah. Can you get me some water? Go for it yourself.
