So many years done in the Babylon, but I still keep movin' on. Movin' on, movin' on, movin' on. Playing it from top once again, this is Cape Town alongside Dennis Brown. I interviewed Cape Town two years ago and he said this is his favorite song ever. So much bad song keep it on and he said this collab with Dennis Brown is his favorite song of all time.
