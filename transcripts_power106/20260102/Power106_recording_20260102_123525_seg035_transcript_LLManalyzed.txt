20260102 123525 It's a while since I've been trying to get it on with you. But you keep on saying you don't know what to do. Don't know much about you, yet you're always on my mind. So all we've got to do is leave it to time. Everything will be fine. Time, time alone can do anything. Time, time can move any mountain. Time, time will make you realize someone's in love with you. Baby, it's true. So what are we gonna do? Now you know how I feel. Will you ever realize that I'm in love with you?
