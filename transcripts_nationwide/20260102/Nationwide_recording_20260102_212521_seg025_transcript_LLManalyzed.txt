It might be very sharp, but it's expected to be of a very short duration. And I think that is where the trade-off comes in. Are you, are you going to, you know, in the quest to rein inflation, basically strangle demand in the rest of the economy? And just going back to the growth figures, when we look at goods producing sectors versus the services sector, you know, there was less demand in the services sectors.

Domestic demand now has to come from elsewhere.
