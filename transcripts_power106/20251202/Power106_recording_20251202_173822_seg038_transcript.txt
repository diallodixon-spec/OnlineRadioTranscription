Don't make no war, don't make no fuss It's a time to love and reason Let's not fight or let's not cuss Oh, it's the season To be jolly. Throw away your folly. It's Christmas time again. Bells are ringing. Yes, it's Christmas. Santa Claus is on his way. Little yes they sing Lots of toys is on its way Oh I say Let's just have a merry Christmas
