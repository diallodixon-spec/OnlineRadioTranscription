20260102 112319 in the mood i just need some solitude oh gosh but everybody's trying to talk to me and nobody's trying to hear me out so you've got some things to say honestly you just all move your mouth the things you say it makes no sense and we're not at a time to figure it out Leave me alone It's best you just leave me out See what I'm trying to say is that this caused me so much pain Feeling like I've got no control over my own brain When it's sad to see that you don't see it's driving me insane Leave me alone now, oh yes Right here now, no for them to get blocked and delete Airplane mode out of life, you're so sweet Come and ring off me line, seven days of the week, oh Me no fear right now
