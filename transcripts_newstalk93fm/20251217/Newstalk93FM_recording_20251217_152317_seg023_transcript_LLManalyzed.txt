20251217 152317 It feels like time is frozen, and night is for us We're alone again, every moment's golden, yeah Feelings I've been holding in, it must be love Whenever I'm broken, you make me feel whole Whenever I'm lonely, you're there for my soul Wherever you are, girl, that's why I call my own Whenever you doubt it, I'll be letting you know Oh, girl, I want to be dancing with you forever You're sick of the storm and you take me as I am am Baby it's magic anytime that we're together I make her just love you and hold you for my hand Hold you for my hand
