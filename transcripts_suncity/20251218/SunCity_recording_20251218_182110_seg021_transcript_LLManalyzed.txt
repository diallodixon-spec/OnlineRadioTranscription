20251218 182110 So being involved in service and how it has shaped my personal growth and development in leadership, I would say it has really a big impact in that development. I'm a big person on learning perspectives. And being in a service club has allowed me to see perspectives of others. And it has allowed me to learn so many things that I've never known before. Also, you know, as my colleague was here saying that, you know, she was reserved, very shy. I was like, that's as well. But being in a service club has allowed me to be more outspoken, allowed me to learn skills and assets that would be very vital in being a well-rounded person and to be able to give back to the community. And even when we go on into working in the corporate spaces or other jobs, so on and forth, it gives us that skills that we can be able to utilize in those spaces.
