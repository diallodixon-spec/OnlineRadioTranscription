20260101 210202 All that I can think of is We should get married We should get married Let's stop holding back on this And let's get carried away Stop making a big deal out of the little things Cause I got big deals and I got little things I got everything I'm asking for but you Stop making a big thing out of the little thing Let's get carried away Come right now, you know where I stand I just wanna say you're mine, you're mine I just wanna say, you're mine you're mine For what you've heard, you're mine, your mine All I'm really asking for is you You're mine, You're mine I just want to say you're mine You're mine, for, you're mine you're mine As long as you know who you belong to
