20251212 181306 This is what my baby said to me. She say she want a good life No one to cause her pain and strife She want a good life, no man to cause her pain And strife She don't want no unsteady relationship One way a rock like a rocking ship Wanna love that steady as can be One that brings back memory She want a good live, no man to cause her pain and strife She's been in and out of love
