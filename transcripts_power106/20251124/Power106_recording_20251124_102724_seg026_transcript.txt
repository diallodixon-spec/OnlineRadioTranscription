I believe the government should make some big catchment thing and store this water because right now if you check Iran, I think they said Iran ran out of water and we have it in abundance and I think they couldn't even export some too yeah so we just need to manage it properly yeah man I think we kind of listen but sometimes we get to listen and you know you're gonna hear say we have dry weather we don't have no water they allow it to run out in the ground yeah man run to the sea yeah and then we have none yeah none.
