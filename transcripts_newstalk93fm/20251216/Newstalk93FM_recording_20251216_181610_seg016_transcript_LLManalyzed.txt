20251216 181610 So many things where they trouble my mind One of you where they make me wake up Me ain't no one make whoever break up Me don't need no other girl to chase up nana Me know all these do emotional Many feelings that help us to love Share your friends don't go laughing now If I say make a show ah Tell me how you feel it baby no pretend Him not know make you tell me now I'm working on you to help us smile you. I just need one girl with a lawyer. You know, send me a good treat to the lawyer. He do me like shy. Oh, yeah.
