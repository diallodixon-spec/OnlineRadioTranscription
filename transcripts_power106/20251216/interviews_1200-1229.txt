**Interview with SBAJ President Garnet Reid**

In a recent interview, SBAJ President Garnet Reid expressed his strong opposition to the 7% electricity rate increase approved by the Office of Utilities Regulation. Reid described the increase as "unconscionable" and questioned the timing, particularly during the Christmas season. He warned that the hike could force many businesses to close and lead to higher prices for consumers. Reid also raised concerns about the $150 million lent by the government to JPS for power restoration efforts and the $5 million provided by the OUR to JPS to recover. He emphasized that there was no need for an increase, given the financial support already provided to JPS.

Reid's comments came in response to the OUR's announcement that customers would see a 7% increase on their bills, reflecting November's consumption. The SBAJ president called upon the government, the OUR, and the Jamaica Public Service Company to reverse the increase, stating that "the nation will be hurt" if it is implemented.
