All my girlfriends, they disapprove, but you are. You're my piece of mind. Mine, mine, nice, so nice. Never catch a vibe that feels so right. When you're not around, I close my eyes and bend to the sun. Lord, he's sweet. So sweet, so sweet, so sweet. Every time he passes me, skin me teeth. Me and the melody and him and the beat.
