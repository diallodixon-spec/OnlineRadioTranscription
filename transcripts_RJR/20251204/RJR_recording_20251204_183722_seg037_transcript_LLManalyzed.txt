Watson. Alright, so you finished college now and you started to work and you said you were given what was called, this is at San Diego, what was called the enrichment group. You said a small class of about 20 students, mainly athletes, who didn't have a whole lot of interest in learning. That alone would have discouraged a lot of people, plus you're a young teacher just out of college and this is your first assignment how did you how did you feel when you when you took that on listen i was intimidated these boys were big and if anybody know me i was small i remember one day i was teaching and i was there and i turned around i was writing on the board and the boy said to me uh mister i don come here to learn now, I just come here to look at you when you turn around and write on the board. Oh my gosh. And that made me feel so uncomfortable. Every day I'm going to work, I make sure I look in the mirror and ask him, how am I looking?
