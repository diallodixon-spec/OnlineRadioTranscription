20251229 144124 the Limitation of Actions Act. That's the specific name of that law. What we don't really talk about is the persons who own property and essentially abandon their property, for whatever reason. The law doesn't care. So I think I touched on it last week. The law does not care that you are overseas and for whatever reason you've been unable to travel to Jamaica to look on your property so you just have to be vigilant the law provides or the law imposes I guess you could say ramifications consequences for landowners who abandon their property who don't take up possession for whatever reason. So please, you have to be very careful. Let me jump over to WhatsApp. That's 876-881-5254. Where do I go to see if someone has obtained title to my land?
