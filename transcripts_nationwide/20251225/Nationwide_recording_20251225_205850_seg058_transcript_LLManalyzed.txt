20251225 205850 inside of me I can't get out of this side of my bed In a world of fantasies I can get you out of my bed I've been waiting for the phone to ring all night But you wanna make me feel so good I got another new home, baby I should get so hung up on you I remember the way that we touched I wish I didn't find you so much I get so emotional, baby Every time I think of you I get so emotional baby I hate this shopping world, I can't feel I hate this shopping what no one can do Hate this shopping world
