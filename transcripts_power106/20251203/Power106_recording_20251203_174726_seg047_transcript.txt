A pair of hop-along boots and a pistol it shoots Is the wish of Barney and Ben Dolls, it'll talk and we'll go for a walk Is the hope for Janice and Jen And Mom and Dad can hardly wait for school to start again It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas Soon the bells will start And the thing that will make them ring is the carol that you sing right within your heart. C is for Christmas, the season of good cheer H is for happiness
