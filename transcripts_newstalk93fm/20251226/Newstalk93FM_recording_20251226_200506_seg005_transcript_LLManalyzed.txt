20251226 200506 I'm coming home and I'll see you again All day, through the night, I'm dreaming Miss Houshiné When you turn it up, make it smooth, my darling When outside it's pouring rain Put a button on the fire Bubbling, you're bubbling, you're bubbling It's over Raise the temperature higher Coming in, you're coming in, coming in closer Make the thing catch your fire Spill it all Ice the cocoa tea, use the sugar I'm talking that we are complete, darling Heat me up Only you I you alone can put fire back in the soul heat me up and they telling me i should leave that fire alone when the more they tell me is the more i'm holding you close i could never let you go
