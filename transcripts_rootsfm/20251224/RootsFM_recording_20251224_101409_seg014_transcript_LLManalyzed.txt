20251224 101409 Forget to hold your hand Know we can feel like forever we've been struggling Just love is our strength Together we're resilient No man can feel a woman's pain I'll be here with you always And we have something that's real We will live forever in this love that we feel And if I ever forget to hold your hand I know it can feel like forever
