We've got together, we'd be causing a commotion I've got the moves baby, you've got the motions We've got together we'd be causin' a commotion You met your match when you met me I know that you will disagree, it's crazy But opposites attract, you see And I won't let you get away so easy A love you say may be your own Can't fight this feeling that you're trying to reveal You won't admit it but you know it's true It's not a secret how I feel when I say it to you I've got the moves moves, baby. You've got the motion. If we got together, we'd be causin' a commotion. Sunday.
