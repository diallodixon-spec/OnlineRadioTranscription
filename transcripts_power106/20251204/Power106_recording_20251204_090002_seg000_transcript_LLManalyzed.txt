============================================================

Everybody's going I know it's gonna be a lot of fun Oh by the way, it's snowing It's been a long, long time And it's late while you cross my mind I guess it's just You're listening to Power 106 FM. The time is now... Nine o'clock. Why is it I haven't seen you around anymore? Another year has passed that I can't erase The memory of your smiling face So I had to call you up and say Gee whiz, it's Christmas So don't forget the party
