20251231 151313 I miss you running through my mind I might even whine if you give me time like been waiting for you I have something for you When it's time to leave in the morning How do you feel for somebody? You can come and look for me If you want a jam well then call me I'll sell off off the DJ At the end of the party Cause when she look and she tell me, she tell me die ass, baby. Take back a die ass, honey. Talk back a die ass baby. So now we ease off the tension. Die ass, baby. Push back a die ass honey.
