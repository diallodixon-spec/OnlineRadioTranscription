20251226 091514 You make me I know that it's so hard to be true Under summer skies I'll write your name in my book At least a thousand times And every day you away Is driving me crazy So I'll ride you every night And I'll sign my name, go away And even if the sun falls down I will always be around For ever and always Forgotten if we both can wait And have the time to celebrate
