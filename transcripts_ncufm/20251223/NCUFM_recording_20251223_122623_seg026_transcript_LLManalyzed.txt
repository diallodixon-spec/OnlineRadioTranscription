20251223 122623 I can tell you it's amazing Feeling cool like I'm under shade Even with the trials I'm facing I still want to make it to heaven So how can I serve you better Saying your name brings pleasure And I will stand through any weather My faith is stronger than leather And I'll share it with sisters and brothers Cause you are the beginning and end You are my family and friend My creator and many more You are my windows, roof and door You are now and forever more You are the wind beneath the birds wings You are everything not something
