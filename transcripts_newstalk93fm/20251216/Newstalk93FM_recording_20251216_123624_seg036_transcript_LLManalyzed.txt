20251216 123624 Waited so long to break these walls down To wake up and feel like me Put these patterns all in the past now and finally live like the girl they all see no more hiding i'll be shining like i'm born to be Hunter's voice is strong and I know I believe We're going up, up, up, it's our moment You know together we're glowing Gonna be, gonna be golden Up, up, up with our voices Don't think it's just a woman
