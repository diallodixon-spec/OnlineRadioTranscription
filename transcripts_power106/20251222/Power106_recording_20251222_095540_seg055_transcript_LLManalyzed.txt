20251222 095540 Somebody is going to tell you that JPS is a private company so you can't interfere with them. But in my opinion... No, JPS is not a private company. JPS is a public private company. And the OUR has a responsibility to see to it that JPS is maintaining its proper function. So when you have polls falling down and people calling and reporting these things and nothing is done to me that that is not an acceptable situation and I think this is one of the things that resulted in. Because of the under-maintainance. The weakened grid, yes. And, you know, the transmission, I hear a lot of people talking about put everything on the ground. The whole world is so foolish that everybody transmits your power.
