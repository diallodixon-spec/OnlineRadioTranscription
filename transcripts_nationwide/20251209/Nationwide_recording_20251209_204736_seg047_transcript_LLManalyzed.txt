are 20 years old and it looks like a man who has been smoking 10 cigarettes a day. Yes. We speak to cigarettes because you can't be sure that if you smoke 10 cigarettes a day George for the rest of your life, once you're past 40, look out for lung diseases, inflammation of the lung airways, shortness of breath and understand that the challenges that are bestowed upon you when it comes to destruction of the airways by smoking cannot be reversed. So if you smoke, whether primary or secondary, and you have spoken to those two, then you do so to your peril because you can't change them. We can only slow down the process with medication but we can't reverse it yes ganja smoking is a different thing because ganja smoking will cause the shortness of breath it can cause inflammation similarly to cigarette smoking but tends to do it to a different mechanism again persons respond to marijuana
