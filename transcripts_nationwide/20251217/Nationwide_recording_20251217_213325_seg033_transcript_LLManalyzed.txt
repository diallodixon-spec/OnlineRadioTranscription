20251217 213325 Well, for me, it's not traditional Jamaican, I don't think, but the roast beef... I love roast beef! Roast beef is nice! Tell you what, I have not been responsible for the roast beef, so I have not had the chance to get a go at it. And I'm not sure if it's a family member, that's the problem. Maybe if it's family member, can't really cook the roast beef good, Mikael. Well, I'm not going to call it about like that. So someone else has forgotten to do the roast beef this year. I'm actually going to take it upon myself to try it this year. And if it doesn't work out, I'll just turn it into a steel beef. I would replace it with... Probably some cold food. Cold food? Cold food belongs in the bin. Cold food is breakfast. Cold food is trash. I think that's breakfast. Okay. Yeah. I don't know. Roast beef with the cranberry sauce. That's what my mother like. Oh Jesus.
