20251215 182718 I'm just talking on a supplier side of it, right? When you need a baker to bake the cake, you need a bartender to serve the alcohol. So that's what I'm talking about. But at the same time, just like what Jamaicans were saying out there now, oh, the government is canceling all parties. They didn't say government parties. Jamaicans, the patrons out there were saying that. So sometimes they're not listening. So it's so easy for them to see somebody dancing and eating cake and think it looked bad. But at the same time, we are employing people to do these things. So we're actually turning, we're building the economy as we go along as somebody. I'm here right now talking on the radio and there's people working, there's people getting paid. Everything that is done, somebody is benefiting from it and that's how the money goes around.
