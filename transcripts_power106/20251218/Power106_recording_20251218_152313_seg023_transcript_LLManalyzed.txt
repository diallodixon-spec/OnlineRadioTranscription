So we are going to be focused on that going into the next quarter and beyond. So we will assign youths to technocrats within the agricultural sector for them to give them that, you know, molding that they need, that handholding to support in terms of technical, you know, information and coaching and so forth. And it's something that the minister would have been, you know, supporting and approved of. And we are going to go forth with it because we see value in those who would have done well in agriculture. You don't have to give back tangible things but the things that you can pass on in terms of information, coaching, very important because sometimes that is value more than anything that is tangible.
