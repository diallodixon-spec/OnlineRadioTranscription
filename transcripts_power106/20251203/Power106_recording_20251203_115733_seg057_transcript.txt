Philip said and depicted them with dinosaur bodies now don't want to critique their PM and she says bombing up drug dealers but pardon a convicted drug trafficker where is my friend Jamaica critic well it don't matter you know Jamaica critic is going to find a way to justify that know, because the man who was sentenced to 45 years by an American court, the former president of Honduras, has been pardoned. And when they asked dumb, dumb Trump, why you pardon him? He said, well, I don't know the guy really, but I was told he was persecuted by Biden. Unbelievable. How can a Republican party, a so-called law and order party of the past, put up with this?
