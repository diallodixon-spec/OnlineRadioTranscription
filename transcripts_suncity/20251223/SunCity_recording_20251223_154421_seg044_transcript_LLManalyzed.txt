20251223 154421 And it's Waffle State on Salt River Road. Waffle State and Salt River Road. Just across, almost across from Lancet Park. And you cannot, I literally was going to tell them that. That's where I used to live. So you cannot miss it. And it's going to be fun. But those persons that live in Portmore and Kingston is a quick drive. And the toll is 20-15 minutes and you're here. And if you take your time, you reach it at 40 minutes. Yeah, man. Yes. They come on down, they come on down, come for a good fight. And as I said, it's not just a party. Look out for a good music show. Yes. But the environment, the experience. It's going to be good. Yes, fuck. So do not miss out on cool on the wharf. It's going to be amazing. And of course, you leave Kingston a little bit, man. I'm going to Clarence, I'm going to experience some niceness, man. Yeah, man, it's going to be a vibe. So I'm looking forward to it, Mr. Dunkley, and keep up the great work.
