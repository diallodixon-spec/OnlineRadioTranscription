20251215 122621 I feel your frequency from miles away. You come alive with one wine, baby. With you, I want to dance the night away One jam, turn a lifetime, baby So don't feel away You don't like the fast life Look on the bright side, girl I go take the blame I just want you to come light it up Just a little winding up Come and meet me behind the truck and we rev it up Whole day, keep throwing it back, otherwise you'll stop Baby no way, we could post up all the pictures you want
