20251223 145540 Hey, girl, what's up? So hold on. Why you look so vexed this early? They're not just that. Lisa, it is so good to see you. But sorry you catch me like this, girl. My uncle sent one bar along when my family go for clarity. You don't want to hear the price the people then put on the something. But matters worse, me hear say half of the thing they missing. And me know say a custom. Girl, how you know say a customs? Lisa, stop going like you're not hearsay? You ever experience that? Customs don't go into your package, suitcase, barrel or cargo unless you worship the item or the agent stand up right there when they inspect it. Listen, customs job is to protect the borders, collect revenue and to facilitate trade. They don't collect or store shipment, they inspect it and somebody has to present it for inspection. So how customs ever get so much cost in them?
