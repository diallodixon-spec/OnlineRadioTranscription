20260101 205533 Sometimes I wanna walk in your shoes Do the type of thing that I'll never ever do I take one look in the mirror And I say to myself Baby girl you can't slip out like this No, no, no And I hate you for your lies and your colors And I hate us for making bad love to each other And I love making you jealous, but don't judge me And I know that I'm being hateful, but that ain't nothing That ain't nothing I'm just jealous I'm just human, don't judge me If you keep me wrong, just keep it mine If you keep me from this, keep it mine
