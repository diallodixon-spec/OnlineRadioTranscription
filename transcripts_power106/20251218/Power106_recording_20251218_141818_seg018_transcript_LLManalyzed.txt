Hi, good afternoon. Good afternoon. And I must comment, what a beautiful market. Now I know that you came on other business, but I, you know, I can't have you pass me by without asking about how it is that we can put together a Christmas meal for families given that we don't have as much money in our pockets this year as we did last year. You know, well, to answer that question, I think I really need to, we need to walk around. We just left Jamaica Forage Clubs and they have an abundance of sweet potatoes selling at 250 per pound. It couldn't be any better. A recipe that readily comes to my mind is candied sweet potatoes. It's always like a Christmas or a festive treat, you know.
