20260102 140910 If you don't like how I say, go find me Lord I don't have time for the work of time so hard They're not mad at me, I'm not going to psych a word Or go join them or enjoy my life for y'all They're my friends from where I've been here to me You don't trust people so I choose them carefully They're all so clean so they can't come near to me Can't compare to me None of we don't know where tomorrow might bring Cause the future be hours away So we all live my life today Cause we all live our life today Not a wife and no shot but no one clapped Not a time that a bird and a hand clapped Have a one-stopper try make me man-stopper
