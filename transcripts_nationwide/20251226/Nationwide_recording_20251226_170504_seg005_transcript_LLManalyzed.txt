20251226 170504 The love in you is wrong I don't want to be right If being right means being about you I'd rather live a longer life Your mama and daddy say it's a shame. It's a downright disgrace. But long as I got you by my side, I don't care what your people say. My friends tell me it's no feature in love when I'm married, man If I can't see you when I want I'll have to see you when I can But lovin' you is wrong I don't wanna be right
