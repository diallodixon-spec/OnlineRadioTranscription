They took away the voices that gave the people pride Now we're plunging into darkness We're young enough to play our part Make up all stars every day, just tell every artist Me the houses, we know what this is Lots of borders, like this house So much alcohol and now we're parties While the girls are rough out of this up over She drink, knock her out Now she don't care when them proper up It's time to light these. Some men sing, I want to hear you go. Times like these. I really wish they were around. Shouldn't have to be like this. Marcus Garvey. We know you're trying your best, but when you figure out the rest. They create up the shot of them, now we have a lot of them. Press up, back up, now the grave, they might go back for them. They rock the national bird wing, sell we all clean. Me no think we own a damn, damn thing. Jam rock, why we giving in to the trick, where them a trick?
