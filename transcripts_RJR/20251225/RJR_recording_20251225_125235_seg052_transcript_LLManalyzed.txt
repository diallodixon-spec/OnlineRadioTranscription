20251225 125235 May this Christmas be filled with memorable moments of love and laughter. And may the year ahead be joyful and prosperous. Merry Christmas from Radio Jamaica 94FM. Oh, for the time you and me And holiday wine Wait for the snow while we read The list that they wrote Selling by the open fire. Loving you's a gift tonight. Loving you for all my life. Loving you is a gift tonight. Happy day is Christmas when you're here with me.
