Well, it's kind of amazing, Scoop, but every morning, I read the Bible and pray to God, and God takes care of the rest. Is it the church you go to, a certain Bible study you attend? Uh, well, those help, Scoop. But I find that prayer in the Bible really helped me to get close to God. Come on, Andy. What do you really do? Well, I'm telling you, a prayer... Andy, our listening audience really wants to know your secret! Fine! I stick my feet in cold spaghetti and read the Bible and pray! So that's the secret! Cold spaghetti! And prayer in the Bible! You heard it here first, folks! No, I was joking! To get close to God, Andy says cold spaghetti! No, it's prayer in the Bible!
