I don't like myself, I don't want anybody else Acting a fool, it's like I surrender Now it don't feel the same, and though I accept the change I can forgive, but I'll remember You never had enough for me I still remember And you never said that you're sorry I still remember It's crazy, this feeling Wake me up, I am dreaming I can't believe it
