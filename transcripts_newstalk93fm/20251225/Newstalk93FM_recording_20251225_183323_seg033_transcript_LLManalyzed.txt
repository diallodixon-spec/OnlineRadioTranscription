20251225 183323 When I'm feeling under the weather You just make me feel sweet Ice the cocoa tea, use the sugar And together we are complete, darling Heat me up Only you alone can put in me. So heat me up. And you're telling me I should leave that fire alone. Well, the more they tell me, the more I holdin', yeah. Miss Houshine, when you turn the top, make it smooth, my darling. When outside is pouring rain, put a button on the fire. Bubble in your bubble in your bubble in the tuba.
