Every tongue shall pass, every knee shall fall. Every knee shall bow, every tongue shall sing that Jesus is Lord that Jesus is Lord Every knee shall bow Every tongue shall bow that Jesus is Lord That Jesus is Lord every knee shall bow Every knee shall bow every tongue shall bow That Jesus is Lord Satan defeated! Satan defeated! Hallelujah! Satan defeated!
