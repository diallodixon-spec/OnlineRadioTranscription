20251231 100808 It's very catchy in terms of how do we need to rebuild. We have to get resilient. We also need to recover, you know, in terms of addressing the emergency need, the critical needs that are very pressing. How do you balance that? So being mindful of that, the SRC is actively looking beyond the subvention, beyond the usual means to which we build out the institution to help support the work that we do here. So I can't speak much on what we are doing in terms of projects that have been submitted or we're hoping that we'll be able to start because again it's contingent on the success of those applications that we would have put in. Do you have a relationship with the DBJ and especially through many of the small businesses that you work with? That's an excellent question. The DBJ is a close partner of the SRC.
