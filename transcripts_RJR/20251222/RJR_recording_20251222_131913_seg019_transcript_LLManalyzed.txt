20251222 131913 This is a little song I sing It's what much time such joy brings Don't worry, just be happy Stay bells ring, are you listening? In the land, lights are glistening. A beautiful sight, we're happy tonight. Walking through this island wonderland. Gone away is the bluebird. Here to stay is the new bird. He sings a love song.
