20251219 192514 Celebration is all I know For every day belongs to man, a man, a man must enjoy life. Now Valentine, it might be more than a day. In April born and she's nothing, just can't stay. They make another one come Mother's Day. Then they send me for work on one named Labor Day. Every day belongs to man. It's just a young man watching with a big smile. But every day belongs to a man-a-man-a man-muffin' joe and I, jibong dangde Every day that I feel with Christmas, same way Celebration all the way, now
