20251230 162216 We are apart from we are little child Me know fi your business and you know fi me too While we go through a bag of struggle and child But we stay true to the link and we never sell out no time When me sit down and pray with life, me haff a smile All we do is a chat, fall in the snow While a built-in drum, not for our vibes And we wander in the sound of us here when we're sixty-five Me dad, me boss, we life We break the drive, you're more than a friend Real tugs never forget the dumb plan, when we come from, yeah Real tugs never worry about pain man, cause we just in the dumb plan Some say we not to live long, the other say a judge meant road to live by Next life say me sell my soul to Satan, Jah bless you if you shape bad mind with it
