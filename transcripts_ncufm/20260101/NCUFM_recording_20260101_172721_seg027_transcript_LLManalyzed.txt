20260101 172721 a happy new year. Wonderful, I'm still here Michael, it's so cold. Marcia from Montego Bay say happy new year to you and your beautiful wife also to the Drive Time family. Right now in Montego Bay we're still without electricity, but we're giving God thanks. I'm happy I can still get to listen. Welcome on board. I hope it's soon, you know. Hopefully I get. Jesus Messiah.
