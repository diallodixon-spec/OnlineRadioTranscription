2025-12-11 21:49:15 we can, to be fair, first of all, Alec Reed, the former principal, can't answer those questions. And we should put out there as well, Saeed, that the principal of the school did indicate to our producer that they will be sending out a statement later today on the matter. Because what I want to understand, Turner, is if a security guard is at a gate, yes, a point of entry, there is a playground. Even though that gate might be at the playground, the security guard has to be scanning one who's coming in and out through the gate and then the other environs. So if somebody comes through the gate, is his name taken at the gate? Then is it reasonable to expect that the security would see exactly where the man goes to see if the man spoke to a teacher or went inside to the classroom to sign out the student if there's a sign-in protocol? What interaction was there in the playground?
