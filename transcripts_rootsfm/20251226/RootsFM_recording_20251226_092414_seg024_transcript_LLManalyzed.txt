20251226 092414 You have it my baby But there's something about you girl when I see you whining in front Please forgive me. Please excuse me, but there's nothing else that a man can do I can't myself. I just need to be next to you before the end of the night Control the gal, control the gal When them fly up in your face, gal Beg them, know them, please Number one in all the race, gal Could never replace Independent and your strong, gal And you'll set the pace Fit and healthy, living long, gal
