============================================================

in the lane snow is glistening a beautiful sight we're happy tonight walking in a winter wonderland gone away is the new bird here to stay is the new bird he's singing his song as he go along walking in a winter wonderland in the meadow we can build a snowman and pretend that he is a parcel brown he'll say are you married we'll say no man you can do the double here in here in town. We ain't a home, we're to conspire. Every dream by the fire. We face our own fate, the dreams that we've made. Walking in a winter wonderland, silver bells.
