20260102 115442 to obtain mercy and find strength to help us in times of trouble. We live in a troubled world, and Lord, the year 2025 was rough, but we can expect that the year 2026 will be even worse than the year 2025, because you have instructed us in your word that as we see the day approaching the coming of our Lord, we will see the desperation and the desolation and the destruction among us but you said God we should not be faith-hearted when we see these things but rather we should look up for our redemption. Thank you for what you have done in 2025 and for what you will do in 2026 we praise you God as we tell you thanks in Jesus name. Amen.
