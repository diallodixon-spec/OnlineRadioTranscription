20251230 212017 I don't know if I'll survive. Song after song, wine after wine. I go sing strong and fit for life. Weak like the masses, kryptonites. You can't find me, we're bound for shaking. Highest meeting, people fighting. So complain if they want to know. Tell them you can't find me. I'll turn the road, I'm ready to walk. Just left work, time to free up. Gonna bow and let me go. Go send a search party to find me. I'm not coming home tonight. I'm not going home tonight. You don't have to be afraid.
