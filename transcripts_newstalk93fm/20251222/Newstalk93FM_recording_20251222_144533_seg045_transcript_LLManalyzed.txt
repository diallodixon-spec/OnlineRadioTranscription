I could over here, darling. I could over there. But we could meet in the middle and start a bacchanal. Play in the middle, hey. What we gonna do now? Jam to a rhythm, yeah. Heat a carnival. But we be heat, hey, what we gonna do now. Start a wine on it. I say compromise on it. Baby, spend time on it. I said compromise on it.
