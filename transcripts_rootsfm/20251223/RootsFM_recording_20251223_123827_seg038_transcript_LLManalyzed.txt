20251223 123827 Police have extended the curfew now in effect for sections of St. Andrew North as part of ongoing operations to reduce crime and maintain public order. The curfew, which covers communities of Park and 100 Lane along Red Hills Road, has been extended for a further 48 hours. It will remain in effect until 6 p.m. tomorrow, Wednesday. Police say the measure forms part of continued law enforcement efforts aimed at restoring calm in areas affected by repeated violence. The extension follows recent security concerns, including a flare-up in violence late last month. On November 30th, 50-year-old Park Lane resident Janet Baker was shot and killed in a drive-by attack in the community. Police say the incident heightened tensions in the area, which has long been affected by gang-related activity. Residents within the curfew boundaries are required to remain indoors
