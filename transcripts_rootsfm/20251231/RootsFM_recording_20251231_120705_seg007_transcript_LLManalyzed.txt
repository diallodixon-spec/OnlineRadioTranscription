20251231 120705 to pour out your grace on hungry people, men, women, and children. We pray for children affected by situation that can bring about sickness. We pray for those who can't find the work to provide for their family and for children who forego an education. Their schools have been, you know, messed up and demolished. And so, they are unable to attend and go to school as they would love to. So, please, I pray, O Lord, for those who are living without adequate health care, for those are sick, for those are dying from treatable diseases. We pray, O God, we pray for the work of a brighter hope for the communities and the projects that, O God Almighty, are in place to bless people.
