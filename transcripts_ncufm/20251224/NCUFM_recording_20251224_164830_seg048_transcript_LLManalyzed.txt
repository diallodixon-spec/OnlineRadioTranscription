Oh, it is a brand new day, I'm leaving them behind. Oh, oh, oh, oh! It's a brand-new day. I'm walking in my purpose. I've got a new way, you ain't got no time. It's a brand-new day, hey, new day. Hey, new day, hey. It's the brand-new day. I'm putting down all my bad vibes It's a brand-new day, I'm leaving them behind It's brand-new night, I'm walking in my proper house
