20251222 121311 So, Father, we ask of you today, for all those who are incarcerated right now, and they leave them children behind. They leave their mother behind. They leave the father, their grandmother, behind father. I extend the love for all those who were incarcerated right now. So, Father, remember the Children's Hospital. It is the season of flu. It's the season of asthma. So we ask of you right now to shoot the arrow of the Lord deliverance right now in the children's hospital, in the university hospital. Show the hero of the lord deliverance into every emergency and by the blood of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, up on our street, on our highway, up on our avenue, up on our lane, we bind motor vehicle accidents in Jesus name. We bind, we cancel and rebuke motor vehicle accidents up on every street, up on every avenue, up on every lane, and up on every Christian right now in the name of Jesus.
