That is June, that is June Mission while my tears are dripping Tell me on the beat so it's a banger Fight the beat again, jump out on me smelling like a millionaire Designing boots, I'm switching the stage, my face, my face My face, yeah, yeah Session of the king, y'all are not here And plus I'm on a gear, fight him out a thing in my ear So when he be my past, that's the way, but if it feel bad, they better tell him be here We gotta act like we're close to fever It's like a broke boy with a post-femida
