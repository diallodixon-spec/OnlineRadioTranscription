this this almost come like something like that you know where where where in parliament the matter was um standing harder all them things if we get through it all them things supposed to get through that you know because we're in a crisis you know a serious crisis you know like that so we need all hands on board everybody's supposed to come together now and say well we're going to fight this thing here we're going to complete the best decision we're next time we're talking about build build and build better we're going we're going to tell this thing here. We're going to come to the best decision. Next time we'll be talking about build and build better. We'll go and tell some people that they can't build here. So again, we have to go from and tell people you cannot build here again. You have to find some ways to build. And the government have to learn all about the place. They have to cut it up and sell people at reasonable price and make people can live and build back the place and build the house properly. That's what we can't listen. It's not helpful when it's another house. So we have to look forward down the road and allow the people around.
