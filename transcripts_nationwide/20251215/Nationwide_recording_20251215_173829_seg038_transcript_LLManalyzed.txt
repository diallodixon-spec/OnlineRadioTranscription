20251215 173829 to discuss now we're being joined by senior communication strategist at the JCF SSB, Dennis Brooks. Good afternoon, SSB. Good evening or good afternoon to your listeners and to your viewers and to both of you. Good afternoon SSB. The commissioner says no complacency but certainly the men and women of the JCF must be feeling some amount of pride and satisfaction this afternoon? Definitely. I think that there's a great deal of pride and satisfaction arising out of the results of their work. A considerable amount of work has been put in over the last several years and so what we're seeing is, of course, of that work being born out but still in spite of being feeling proud there is no complacency. SSB Brooks tell me are these numbers impressive as they are yeah sustainable
