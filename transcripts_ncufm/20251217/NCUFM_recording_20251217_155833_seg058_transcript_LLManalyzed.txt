20251217 155833 Something tells me that there's someone out there who don't want to be too late when the trumpet of God shall sound. Today is the day, now is the time, cause tomorrow is promised to no man and there's no repentance in the grave. So accept Jesus today as your Lord and Savior, cause tomorrow might just be too late.
