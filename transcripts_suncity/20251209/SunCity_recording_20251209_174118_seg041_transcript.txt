============================================================

I think tomorrow is the only day that nobody at all celebrates their birthday. Nobody at all. Happy birthday again to you, sir. I had no idea. I know you probably told me a million times, but sorry. Sorry I forgot, okay? I hope you're enjoying your day and so I'm so grateful that you still found the time to listen to Sun City and send us a message and keep in touch with us. Today is your day. Where's your surf if you can't come up when you go down? That is it.
