You're folding by the fire's gentle gleam Threads of our lives like a warm tender dream Your kindness a beacon, your calmness a guide With your laughter a journey, we joyfully ride The spirit of family, forever young. The glows of Christmas light, testing love so bright. Together we hold our smiles in the night. Joy and peace.
