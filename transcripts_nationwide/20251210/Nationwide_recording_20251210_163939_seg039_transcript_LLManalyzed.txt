Make a snap with your pretty friend You a walk with a pretty crew Every girl in a your crew pretty You know, you want me to all it up You're pretty bad, I want to get you all Body half of your life, gave it up Me say me love it, all your dollies up We no lie, need you for wine now Me burn you, gone like a spider Me burn you pretty like a British band Pretty like a British band
