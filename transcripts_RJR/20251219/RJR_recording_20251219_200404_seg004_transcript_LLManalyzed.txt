20251219 200404 You should talk all your feelings. Pour some rum right now in my cup. I can see how you're feeling. Tell the DJ to play my tune. Don't wanna see my yard no time soon. Cause I feel like wine up closer. Right. I don't want to go home sober. Fire up! I ain't the mood. I see an alien beyond. I'm just feeling good. I'm feeling good, I'm feeling good. Cause we're not in that mood. Fuck the negative deviant. I'm just feelin' good. I'm feelin' good, I'm feeling good. Living in a world that can feel so sad. You should talk how you're feeling. I'm not a politician, they call me.
