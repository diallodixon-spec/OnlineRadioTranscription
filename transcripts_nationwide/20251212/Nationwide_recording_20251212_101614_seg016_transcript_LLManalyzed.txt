2025-12-12 10:31:40 there was no roof but we had the four sides around us when I came back I said God even if he is dead I'm not leaving him out there at the time his father was out there with him trying to take the concrete off his head but it was too heavy what happened now I said I'm going back out there So I went back out there and His father kept calling him. He said his pet name is Jordan. I said he said Jordan no answer Jordan again. No answer. So he gave over gave him over I say I'm not leaving him out here and he decided that we're not gonna leave him out here So he'd made a third call when he made the third call. He yes daddy and to God be the glory I can't say it was just him that took the thing from his head it was God God helps him he lifts the thing lifts anything from his head
