20251218 184520 love to serve, a price of sea care, and it's something that I will always carry with me in anything that I do, giving back to others, because persons do really need the help, and we're not an island, we're not alone, and to the few, tomorrow for me. So you don't know when anything can happen to you, and you won't need the help. And so as my colleague said, it's not about the money, you know, getting any rewards for anything, but it's just to be able to put a smile or give hope to other persons. Yes, I agree with you. Do you feel as though, you know, the work that you you guys have been doing, you feel like you're inspiring other youths or have you gotten any any of your friends or colleagues coming up to you and being like, you know, what is it you do? I'm very proud of what you're doing or I like what you're doing I'd like to be a part of it have you ever gotten any of that response yeah
