We look forward to before the actual match begins and then after the match we of course give the big trophy and continue off here with the amazing prizes. Beautiful. Looking forward to a great final. Hats off to you and your team. Now 22 years of a wonderful competition. I know you guys put in a lot of work into it. Michael Gonzalez, congratulations. And we look forward to a wonderful marquee event that is the Television Jamaica Junior Schools Challenge Quiz Grand Final, scheduled for tomorrow. Of course, ensure that you're in front of your TVs or your laptops or your computers early, at least 15 minutes before, so you can settle in and catch all that there is to be offered. Thank you once again sir, all the very best for a great show tomorrow. Thanks Jesse for having me and all the best to you and your listeners. Great, take care. Michael Gonzales there, the executive producer of TVJ's Junior Schools Challenge Quiz.
