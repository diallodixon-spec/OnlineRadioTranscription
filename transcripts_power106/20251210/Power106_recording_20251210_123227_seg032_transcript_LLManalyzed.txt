============================================================

If Jah is standing by my side Then why should I be afraid Of a pestilence that crawled by night Your best you tried to harm me and I, ain't meant to kill But I love you still, cause you are here to make prophecy fulfill It's your will, no weapon that form against me This anger shall not be divine protection
