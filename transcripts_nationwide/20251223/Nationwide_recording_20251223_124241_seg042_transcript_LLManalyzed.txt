20251223 124241 I am a guy who starts early in the morning at five o'clock in the morning. So six o'clock I'm on listening to the news and I listen to you and I love the consistency. Love the consistency. And we want to see a balance in the thing. We want an active, vibrant opposition. But we want people who speak truth. And not to be too disingenuous, you know what I mean? And we want the watchdog and we want to hold the Prime Minister feet to the fire, do the right thing, making sure that your MPs and people under you are doing the right thing. And if they're not doing the right thing, get them out. Exactly. We cannot go back where we are coming from.
