20260101 212118 Got you! Don't worry your brain Don't you fret just listen I'm saying Serious be serious I'm looking at my face I'm trying to take you back to my place No one baby just stick to my pace Back steady girl to the rhythm and bass Come baby girl we have no time for wait Don't wanna run you down don't wanna change Baby won't you light my fire? Can you take me higher? When you rub it on me, you really spark my flame. Baby won't you like my fire?
