20251223 135737 Mommy, I never expected us to get anything at all to prepare for Christmas dinner, you know? Well, I'm glad we got what we needed. So, what's on the menu for this year? Any surprises? Well, you know, the usual, baked and fried chicken, little curried mutton, you know, your father doing the ham, the regular gunga rice and peas and chicken foot soup and cake and sorrel to top it off. Miss, I am leaving the salad to you. Okay, I have some can execute this plan.
