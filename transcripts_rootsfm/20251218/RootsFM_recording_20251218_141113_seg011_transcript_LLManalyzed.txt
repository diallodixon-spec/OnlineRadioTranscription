No brilliancy No militancy So you can't talk to me We don't buy your house alone They can't buy me free money Never be sure of respect or my ability Willpower strong mind and ability And every ghetto youth Any case and that's the key World are your militant let me show you Unibrow and Charlie. Child is the testing of everything. But willpower, strength, mind and ability. Live the cake yourself to what you're doing and you'll reach for the top. Oh gosh, tell them, tell them, sit down. Your mismanager is 96.
