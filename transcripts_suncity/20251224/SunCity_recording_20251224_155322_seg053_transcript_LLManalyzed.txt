20251224 155322 Oh, baby. Honey, you gave your meaning to my life. I was having a discussion with some DJs and they were letting me know that them song you can't play at any R&B or Souls event. They don't want to hear no reggae music. They don't believe that reggae music should be played at any R&B or soul's like lover's event. Strictly love songs. So this is what? This is not a love song? It's not a love song to them?
