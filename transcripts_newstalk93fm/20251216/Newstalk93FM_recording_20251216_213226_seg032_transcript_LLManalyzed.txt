20251216 213226 Hey, can we talk some business? You know, I want your company. And it's nothing too risky Limited liability Don't worry If you try all the things I like You could still be shy in the morning So don't feel away You don't like the fast life But look on the bright side I go take the blame I just want you come and rise it up Just a little whine there now Come and meet me at the end of the truck and we rev it up
