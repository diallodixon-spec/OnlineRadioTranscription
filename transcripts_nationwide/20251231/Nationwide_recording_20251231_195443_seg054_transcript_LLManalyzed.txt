20251231 195443 It's even harder to picture That you're not here next to me They say it's too late to make it But is it too late to try? And in that time that you wasted All of our bridges burned down I've wasted my nights You turned out the lights Now I'm paralyzed Still stuck in that time When we called it love but even the sun sets in paradise I'm out of pain I'm trying to throw home all of the change I spent on you without the times gone baby so wrong we are the plans we made far too if happy ever afters did exist I wish to be holding you like this All those fairy tales are full of hate One more stupid love song I'll be singing
