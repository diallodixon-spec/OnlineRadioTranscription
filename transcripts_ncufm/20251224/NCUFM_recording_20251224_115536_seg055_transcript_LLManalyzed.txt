20251224 115536 Thank you for the many little things in life that you bless us with on a daily basis. The rain, the sunshine, the wind that blows, Father, the calmness. We thank you for it all, Lord. Allow us to find beauty in these mundane things as well. Allow us to understand that your hand is at work in nature and that we must not take it for granted. Thank you, Lord, for what you continue to do for us once more. In your name I pray. Amen. You are the one that we praise You are the one we adore
