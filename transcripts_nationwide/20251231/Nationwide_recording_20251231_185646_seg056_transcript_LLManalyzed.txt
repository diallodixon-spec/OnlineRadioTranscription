20251231 185646 Sorry, could you complete, I thought it specifically provided for where this victim impact statement that the farmers are able to get? In the amendment, in the new amendment that we passed in the house yesterday, it brings in a victim impact statement. And it says that upon conviction of a brother-in-law related offense, that a direct court, that the judge may ask for a victim impart statement to be given by the complainant and that will be taken into consideration in sentencing. Again it's something that when I you know went around and listened to the farmers a lot of them but if you know the court process you know you know the complainant sometimes you're just there and you don't necessarily get to share, especially the sort of damage that has been done, especially the person who pleads guilty. So that has been brought into the law. That's quite significant, Minister, I must say. Did we model that from another jurisdiction?
