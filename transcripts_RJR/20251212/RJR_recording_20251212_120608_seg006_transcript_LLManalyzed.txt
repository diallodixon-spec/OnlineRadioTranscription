2025-12-12 12:52:27 Wednesday's post-cabinet media briefing, Information Minister Dr. Dana Morris-Dixon said only small in-office recognition activities will be allowed with no rentals of external venues. JCSA President Tisha Clark-Griffiths has criticized the manner in which the directive was issued, arguing that it was done without consultation with unions representing public servants. Speaking today on the morning agenda on Power 106, Mrs. Clark Griffiths said the association was not advised of the move beforehand and received no information on how the funds allocated for the events will be redirected. She is urging the government to clearly outline how the money will be used, stressing that any reallocation should support public sector workers who suffered losses in the aftermath of Hurricane Melissa. For me, if there is no clear policy from the Ministry of Finance, the monies that are allocated for this function cannot be used otherwise unless directed by the Ministry of Finance.
