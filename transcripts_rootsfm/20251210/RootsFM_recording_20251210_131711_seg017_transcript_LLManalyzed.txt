============================================================

Why does the sun go on shining? Why do these eyes of mine cry? Don't they know it's the end of the world? It ended when I lost your love I wake up in the morning and I wonder Why everything is the same as it was I can't understand No, I can't understand Why life goes on the way it goes Why does my heart go on beating? Why does the sea rush go? I know the scores, I know the scores
