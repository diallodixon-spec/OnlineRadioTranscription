Thank you Doreen for this great reminder. Proverbs 16 verse 3 says commit your plans to the Lord and he will make them succeed. Your success isn't about your skills, it's about his grace. Carmen, import more rocking to the songs as usual. Glad you're enjoying Carmen. Joan Ferguson, good morning to you. She's wishing all the cruisers a great Wednesday. Miss Annie's Cruisin' As Usual, blessings to you Miss Annie.
