resilience and strength of our communities. As we gather this Yuletide season to celebrate, reflect, and enjoy the holiday cheer, it's important to prioritize safety and responsibility for all. Join us this Thursday on JCF Now for an engaging conversation with the Peace Step Safety Boss, Dr. Gary McKenzie, Assistant Commissioner of Police, as he shares essential road, personal, and property safety tips for the busy season. We will also discuss the significance of permits for public events, why they are important, and how proper planning ensures the safety of patrons, organizers, and the communities. That's JCF Now, 8 p.m. to 9 p.m. on Radio Jamaica 94 FM. Let's be wise as we celebrate Christmas 2025. You're listening to Beyond the Headlines with Dionne Jackson Miller.
