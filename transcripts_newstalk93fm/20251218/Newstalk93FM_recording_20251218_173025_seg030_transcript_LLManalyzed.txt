And the other one price that you cannot fix this is the beast that you cannot buy find it a way where you cannot see man with this cyst if he cannot breathe i need to find release but behind my mind it runs all these thoughts are troubling me find it to give up my baby find it to be on my lane my mind running to the other side When it's time to leave my life, planning trying to take me out Tell you what I need, right, yeah I really need, I really need money I really need, need a free mind I really need, really need time
