Life is better than anything you feel behind the wheel of a car. Trust me. I could not agree more. You know what? Let's switch to something happy for the end of the show. Some nicer upbeat and so on. The UDC Fireworks Festival, which we kind of know as Fireworks and the Waterfront, and well, it's kind of like Fireworks and many waterfronts, because there will be shows in Kingston, Ocho Rios, Mount Egobie, Black River and The Grill this year. Yeah, the UDC says it won't be the major stage show we are accustomed to. The experience will focus on good music, a relaxed atmosphere and opportunities for socialising leading up to the fireworks. It's one of the best events where the whole family can attend. If you can, definitely go out and support and ring in the new year with a nice fun family vibe.
