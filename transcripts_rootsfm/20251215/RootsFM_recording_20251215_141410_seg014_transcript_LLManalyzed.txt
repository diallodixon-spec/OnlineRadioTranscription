20251215 141410 Believe me, how we now Deals and fears have to be paid Corrections have to be made To find the happiness we all search for. To quit I would kiss my father. And I know I love him better. I say not giving up so tough luck. I'm striving straight up to the top Not giving up off stake a block Got to find a way to pull a stop Not giving up won't stay stuck I'm striving straight off to the top
