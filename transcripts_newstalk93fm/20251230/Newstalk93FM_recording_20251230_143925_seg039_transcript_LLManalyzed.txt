Move up your body and I swing, I am the king for your world. So the bubble when you bring it, just mesmerizing. It is tantalizing, come make me seal it, girl. Come on, love me, don't cause a limit, girl. So don't flunk me, let me auntie not dessert. You know I'm the man figure with it, girl Love all your wine on spinning, girl Come give me life and I'll change yours Girl, all these times I say flow rate On the high way we loaded my love is worth it
