damaged, the vein may actually allow blood to leak out, can clot, and result in the clot occurring. Now, if the clot occurs within the vein itself that can travel through, that's a greater risk of problem. So, injury to the vein is the more common type of cause that may happen. A slowing of the blood flow is another cause that we discussed it already that if you are not moving, then remember that this is gravity fed. No, it's not really gravity fed, but it is like the gravity fed water that is a low pressure. So if you are sitting there or standing there, not moving, then for the blood to make it to to the heart it has to go against gravity and that may cause the blood to pool if you're not moving because when you move now the muscles contract and squeeze against the vein and because of the valves on the inside it allows the blood to flow in one direction towards the heart.
