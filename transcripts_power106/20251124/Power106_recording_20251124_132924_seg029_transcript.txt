We don't want to move the people. Listen, you realize in this country that we have a government that looks after the people. We do have a government that look after us as Jamaicans. We do have that DNA of a government. Because you have some little idiots that come from this, they take up taboos, the people they defend for themselves. When you lose your house, when you lose, you kill animals that are dependent to support yourself. When you lose the little farm you have, you can go dig one sweet potato and cut one banana. And the little shop down the road where if you don't have money, you can go trust the farmers. All of them, they match up. Who do you expect the people to live? And people are taboos, white people must defend. I'm taking a break and come back to you.
