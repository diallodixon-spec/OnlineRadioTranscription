============================================================

Give thanks and praise to every living thing on the face of the earth, the heavens, the seas. I like to give thanks and praise to all human beings that you have created in your image and likeness. Omnipotent, omnipresent. Give thanks to plants and animals which are a beautiful part of your creation. Give thanks to the elements of life. Eat air, earth and water. But I give Tang some music, you know. But through music almost I, I'll still say the first.
