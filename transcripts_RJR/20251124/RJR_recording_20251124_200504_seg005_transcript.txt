============================================================

Even when I stumble or when I fall You love me, forgive me in spite of it all And when they come for me When people lie You provide a way out so i can smile that's why i can't give up look how far you've carried me can't give up you give me strength when i am weak Can't give up Cause as far as I can see Can't give up With every breath that's left in me Victory My God, my God
