20251219 094332 Forever, right? Forever. I've seen where people have been using, say, recycled plastic bottles and stuff and fashioning them into extrusions, fashioning them into construction, into blocks. No, I don't know if that might lead to more leaching of micro-plastics in the environment. That would be another kind of concern. But it is certainly worth considering taking all of this waste plastic. You know, you have an entire island larger than Jamaica outside in the Pacific, right, with plastics. But I'm saying, taking some of these waste plastics, maybe making them into other kinds of stuff, other kinds of building material, rather than degrading the environment. But again, you have to think systemically, UL, where you're saying, all right, are you going to save what the cock, as my mother said, and leak out of the bone? But you have to put it all together. And that's why it has to be about tone planning and those things, and not just architecture or building technology.
