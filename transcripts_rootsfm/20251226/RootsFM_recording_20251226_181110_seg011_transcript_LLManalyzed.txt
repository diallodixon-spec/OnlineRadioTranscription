20251226 181110 from the sky so let it rain on you and let it rain on your heart baby You don't have to say a word Let your heartbeat speak for you, girl And it is falling for your girl So let the raindrops speak to you All I have is you Right here, right now Say my name, in the rain, in the rain Zombie I beg you, hold me tight and whine for me please The lion and the embers, time to release The spirit of love, make you you love love
