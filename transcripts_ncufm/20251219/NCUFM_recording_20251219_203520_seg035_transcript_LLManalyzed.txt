20251219 203520 By the river's water See there'll be victory Let me be saved My soul's a king My soul's a whore It's Christ the Lord No guilt in life, no fear in death This is the power of Christ in me From life's first cry to final breath, Jesus commands my destiny. No power of hell, no scheme of man can ever plot against me.
