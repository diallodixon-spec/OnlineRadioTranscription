20260101 133327 I believe every lie that I ever told Pain for every heart that I ever stole I played my cards and I didn't fold Well it ain't that hard when you got sold This is my world Somewhere I heard that life is a test I've been through the worst but I still give my best God made my mold different from the rest Then He broke that mold so I know I'm blessed Stand up now and face the sun Won't hide my tail or turn and run It's time to do what must be done Be a king with kingdom pounds Well you can tell everybody Yeah you can tell everybody So wait and tell everybody I'm the man, I'm the man I'm the man
