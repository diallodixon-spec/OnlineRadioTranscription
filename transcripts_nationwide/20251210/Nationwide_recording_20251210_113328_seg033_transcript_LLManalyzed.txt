Yes, sir. I watched it last night. Okay. I watched some of it out. I must confess. I was in between the parliament and cricket. Mm hmm. But what I saw at first, I think the opposition eh be able to say well and the question they asked, I think it was good. Yes. Well, I think eh the finance minister, I think she was off the pace For one, I don't think she should have allowed the speaker to have to tell her that the doctor was not in line with the question. She knew that the person was going to ask questions. I think she should have been better prepared.
