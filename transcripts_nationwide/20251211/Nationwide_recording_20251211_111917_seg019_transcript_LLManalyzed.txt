My hands were steady My eyes were clear and bright My walk had purpose My steps were quick and light Welcome back, welcome back. Thank you so much for sticking and staying with us right here inside Cliffhuse online. Junior is up next. Top of the morning to you Junior, what's on your mind? Yes, I'm sorry. I got a friend of mine. He has a birthday on the 25th of December. He wants me to show him the most when that day comes. His name... Yeah, he born on the 25th December 1966. I'm going to do that for him, please.
