20251225 110703 We can take the darkness, let it fall through light. Let your love flow back to me. I can't believe I'd let this feeling die. Don't you let it die. This happy room would be a lonely, lonely place. A lonely place if you would go go Please say you'd stay and let it grow I want this love to grow So don't throw it all away Your love, more love, don't throw it away Your love Don't throw it away, your love, more love Don't throw away, your love When you want all the love you deserve
