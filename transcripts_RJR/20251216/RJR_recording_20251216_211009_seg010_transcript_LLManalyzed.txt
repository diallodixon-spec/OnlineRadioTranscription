20251216 211009 well and many of you on social media and in fact in the Jamaican landscape would be quite familiar with that name he is a former mayor of Maypen and he was involved in a situation quite recently we're not going to talk too much about it because I gather charges have been laid in a certain matter that to the place before the court and you know we don't discuss court matters on the program until after they have been laid in a certain matter that took place before the court. And you know, we don't discuss court matters on the program until after they have been resolved. But I do want to use this medium to commend him publicly. I've done it privately. I want to commend him publicly for his heroic efforts in plotting what could otherwise have been a very dreadful situation. Good evening, Sian. Welcome, great to have you on Balancing Justice. Good evening to you, Sir Earl, and to your guests. Thanks for having me. Yes, and I know in case listeners are wondering what we're talking about.
