20251212 130404 Jesus, little one. He said, he's gone away. Jesus, little one, he's coming back to enter me home. And that's why I'm living this life, just to live again. And with my Lord, I know that I shall reign. Devil, I won't stray. I shall not stray. Hallelujah. Jesus will reign. I know he's coming back. Jesus will reign, because the Bible tells you he will. Jesus will reign with hope. I'm going home. If anybody asks you, what's the matter with me? Tell them I'm losing my life.
