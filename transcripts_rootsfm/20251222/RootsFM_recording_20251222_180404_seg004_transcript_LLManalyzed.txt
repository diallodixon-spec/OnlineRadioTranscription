20251222 180404 And my face flat solid as a rock Anything we go and you walk me back We have love lock when we physically contact It's like a palm drop So me know seh me can't stop Cause your love is it in your heart. To forgive this tug. You know you know what I love. It's been a year now since I left you, boy. 365 days. It's not the same without me in your world.
