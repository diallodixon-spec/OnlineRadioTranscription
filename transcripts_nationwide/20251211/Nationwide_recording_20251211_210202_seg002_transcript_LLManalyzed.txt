2025-12-11 21:16:28 a six-year-old girl was abducted from her school in Clarendon Tuesday afternoon. Nationwide News understands that she was playing in the schoolyard at the time. She was spotted two hours later being forcefully led down a busy highway by an unknown man. Now, this comes two years after an eight-year-old, Daniel Rowe, was abducted from a school in St. Catherine. And Daniel was later found with severe injuries and died two days later. The perpetrator in that 2023 incident, Caida Sachel, was sentenced to life in prison in December of 2024. The incidents have raised the concerns about the security of school premises and the safety of students while they are at school. To discuss these issues, we are now joined by the children's advocate, Diane Gordon-Harrison, and President of the Jamaica Independent Schools Association, Tamar Mackenzie. Good morning. Good morning to you and morning to your listeners.
