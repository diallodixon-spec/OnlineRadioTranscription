20251229 154224 Go away Say don't ever go away You pick me up those times I'm down You make me laugh when there's no clown No one else can love me like you do Heaven knows that I'll proclaim The love I feel when I hear your name There's no substitution, quite the same Now some say I'm crazy And I'm hurting insane But there's no life without you so I'll take my claim My love is for you It's easy to see My love's for you
