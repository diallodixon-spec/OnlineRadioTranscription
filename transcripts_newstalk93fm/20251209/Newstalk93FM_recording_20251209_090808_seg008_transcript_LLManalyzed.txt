Too many say these words, not enough are sincere. Oh, the words of freedom, liberty, stands out in my soul and my mind. Tears come to my eyes when I realize Just this is blind I have a dream That someday We'll all walk hand in hand I have a dream that some way, for our children this will be a better life. Now maybe you can't see my me, and you can't see me dreaming.
