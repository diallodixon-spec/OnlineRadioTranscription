20251219 210404 of the Association of Jamaican Potters to develop this fair. We are the longest-running art and craft fair in the Caribbean, run by artists and artisans. We only have 100% Jamaican-made products. We do not do any imported items because we want to support the Jamaican economy. And support it, they do. In fact, every attendee does. When you come and support, you are doing for a very worthy cause. Certain people who walk through the place on October 28th, I'll name no names, they have disrupted our economy. A lot of people who have not actually had their workshops or homes destroyed have had their livelihoods emaciated because the hotel industry where a lot of our participants would have sold their artwork they're no longer currently open so they come to our show trying to make ends meet and they do not want a handout
