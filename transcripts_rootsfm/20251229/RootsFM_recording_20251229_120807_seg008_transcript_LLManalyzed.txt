20251229 120807 for my mighty God, and these children will be blessed in Jesus' name. So I thank you, Father. And today we put our Prime Minister before you, leaders of the opposition, our members of Parliament, and we ask that you, Father, touching down in 2026, that you will give them more wisdom to survive. You will give them a better understanding so that they can appreciate the people of Jamaica. But we have one thing we say on this request line, out of many Jamaica people, we are one. So we just give God thanks today, and I thank you, Father. Father, remember every soldier. Remember every policeman who worked hard over the Christmas season. And I ask of you, Father, continue to bless their family. Continue to bless their children. Father, I ask of you today to bless those young guys, God almighty, who wipe the car glass out by three miles. They regret in my heart, Father, that they will continue and they will move from just wiping glass to driving car and do other things.
