20251229 185539 They'll be looking to jump start in the winning ways that they had early in the season. So I'm looking forward to Brighton coming away the win there. All right, great. All right, Tom, the marquee match of the round, Arsenal versus Villa. Yes, this one is a big, big match in so many ways because it's first versus third. They're separated by three points. The goal difference though is in Arsenal's favor so whether or not regardless of the outcome they will remain on top but I think that Villa on this run that they're on an 11 game run that they've won all 11 there on a proper win streak I think that even though they travel to the Emirates that they can win this game because the two teams played recently Aston Villa won and what I think gives Aston Villa the edge is that they're actually scoring goals if we look at the last three games that Arsenal have played they've only scored once they've won all three but they've only scored one goal
