============================================================

There are days when I feel like I can't make it Just like everyone says Living on memories, how good life used to be Oh, but if I only trust Him, only try Him, only say a prayer, I'll give in pain in Jesus' name. Don't take my love on my way. Try Jesus. My Jesus. He's the one to depend on. He will conquer rights on sight. Try Jesus, try my God. He has never lost a battle. He will never lose his power. When it's his time, no one can stop him.
