20251231 202725 I thought I'd never love again I thought my life was alright I didn't want to face or receive another day Suddenly, from nowhere, maybe you appeared You dried my tears, You cared for me Maybe you're in love with me If you'll excuse me It's because of you I was able to Fall in love again You gave me you give me some? Someone to love, someone to touch. Someone to hold, someone to know. Someone to know.
