20251230 121514 for all his many blessings towards us from January until now. The last Tuesday in the month of December in the year 2025. So this is the way I'm praying the word of God back to him. Psalm 150 verse two says, praise him for his mighty acts. Praise him according to his excellent greatness. There's a song that says, roll back the curtains of memories no one then. Show me where you brought me from and where I could have been. Remember that I am only human and human understand. Lord just remind us, remind, God has been a faithful God to us. We have gone through, we have experienced a category five hurricane and God has kept us.
