20260101 165239 Oh Ophelia I'll keep you 100 on the land The sea, the sky Pledge allegiance to your hands Your team, your vibes I don't care where the hell you've been Cause now, now You're mine It's about to be the sleepless night You've been dreaming of Ophelia Tears locked inside my memory And only you possess the key no longer drowning and deceived all because you came for me locked inside my memory
