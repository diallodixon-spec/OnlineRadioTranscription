20251216 150907 and you would you marry me anyway would you have my baby if I were a miller And the mill should grind me Would you miss for a lover man girl Your soft shoes shine Would you love me Tell me would you love me? Tell me, would you love me the same? Would you love me, the same way? What if a carpenter hurt my only skill? Would you love my skill? Tell me would you love me? What if a phone call me a jugglin' a Mandeville? Would you love to tell me would you love to see me? What if I couldn't bring you down on the North Coast figure chair? Would you love, would you tell me would you like to see me? Or make up empty?
