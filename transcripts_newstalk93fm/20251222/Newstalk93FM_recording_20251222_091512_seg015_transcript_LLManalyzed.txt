20251222 091512 My bed with my head to the ceiling See I'm drowning alone and I'm lost in my feelings Somebody send me a sign cuz you know that I need it Can't even come back to me cause you know you're my healing. I said it's okay, it's my therapy. Therapy, my therapy. It took away all of my anxiety. Anxiety, my remedy. I tell you that we all need love. Jump up and show me love. Wait up, and show me love, together. Say we all need love, jump up and show love, wait up, and show love. So come back, we shout that together. No place that I'm not at home.
