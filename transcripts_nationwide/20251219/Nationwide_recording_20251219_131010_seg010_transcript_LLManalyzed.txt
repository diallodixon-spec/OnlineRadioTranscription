20251219 131010 I'll never hold you for life Hold you for life Over and over again, yeah, my love is burning day Feels like time is frozen and light is for us We're alone again, every moment's golden, yeah Feelings I've been holding, it must be love Whenever I forget, you make me feel When I run away, you're the first I know what you do, but it doesn't seem like I know when I'm at it, it's how I do it It's life you said you'd give for me, what's that? Not to spend your man before I have Not to fight life in the air, God I know my life is in your arms Don't be lazy, I need you, she know me I just get the danger It's in a skipper, this life is empty A keeper for my belly
