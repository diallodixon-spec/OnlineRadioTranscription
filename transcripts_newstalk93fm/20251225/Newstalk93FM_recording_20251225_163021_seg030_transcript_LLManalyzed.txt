20251225 163021 You're listening to Sleek Radio, 93 FM. I have a lining spirit Early in the morning I hat it Me cooler ready Me heist done ready Me punching that's automatic I have a lining jumbie A kind of energy inside me And it ready for the rum Ready ready for the rum, ready ready for the rum ready Ready for the action A spiritual encounter Kid my soul taking over Telling me to start up the drinking Can't do away with good behaviour So we out on the road now Boom! It's Mars and Riddy Man Soaker And I'm ready for the rum
