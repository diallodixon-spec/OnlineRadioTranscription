20251216 181613 Because I see the link of Khalil's fundraising is still running, but it's not stopped. There's nothing there. It didn't start. There is a money that you have fund. It's $27,000, right? There is cost of advertising, so the company lost money. They advertise and advertise and they didn't receive money back. They lost money. I lost money too. The money that I gave you, the money that I spent on production, I lost. BBCI spoke to nine families across five continents and across all the campaigns we investigated. It didn't matter how much money they raised. The outcome for the families was the same. They received none of the money raised. BBCI put out allegations to Erez Hadari and Chancellor Tikva, but they did not respond. All right, listening to that report there from the BBC. All right, remember our WhatsApp line, folks, 876-254-0693.
