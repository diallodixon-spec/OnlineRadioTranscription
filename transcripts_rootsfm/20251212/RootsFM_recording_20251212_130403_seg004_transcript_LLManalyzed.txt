20251212 130403 I only wanna find the love my heart's been searching for I climb most every mountain, swim from shore to shore Just to feel the song pressing from your warm embrace In this ocean of love, no one can take your place You're listening to it and stare. Do your dance, do your dance. Do your dance with mama. Come on, baby, tell me, what's the word? Oh, wait up. Oh, if we might say, will you hear?
