When I was in high school, there were a lot of young people who were misguided. Same thing in Florida. Lots of people are misguided. Weed is now a big thing. It's legal, not recreationally, but medically, and so it is in the hands of misguided teens. And so they would get in trouble, they would be stopped, and they would be stopped for just a little amount of weed, and then they would go to jail. And so the county decided that they wanted to start the civil citation program where if a teen gets in trouble, they would not necessarily go to prison. So I love to see people get to a resolution instead of focusing on a problem.
