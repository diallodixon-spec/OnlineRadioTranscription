20251217 150102 New York, how she come from there When you come in my baby How she come from there Atlanta, she come from there Toronto she come from there And I know that you miss me I love the way that you bring a vibe With your hands them up in the sky Falling down and having a time Wine in season again And we have the money to spend And we jammin' down to the end Runnin' with me cannibal friend I'll be a candy ball friend Until we meet up again Everything on site, you know The bag been packed, you know She dreamin' to take a ride on me Cause she comin' down to please When she ram a chair, she push it back All the bambas rollin' And she say them sound from me
