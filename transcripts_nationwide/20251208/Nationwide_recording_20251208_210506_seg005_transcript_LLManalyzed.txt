Happy people, keep us, keep us steppin' Happy people, keeps us movin' I just wanna get dressed I'm gonna go out Can you tell me where the spark is? We'll be partying all night Everybody's having a good time I'm gonna get high Can you tell me Where the spark is? I'm gonna take me to the place Where there ain't nothing My life will never be the same Girl you came and changed The way I want The way I don't I cannot explain The things I feel for you The girl you knew is true Stay with me, I'll fill my dreams And I'll be all you need
