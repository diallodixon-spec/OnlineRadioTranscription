this one's up. Just give me one more shot inside my glass and watch me level up. Fitting like a hero. Call me hero. As I raise my hand, I'll leave the bad vibes on zero. Fitting like hero. Soak a hero. As soon as I reach the dance, I'll leave my conduct on zero. Fiting like a hero, soon as I reach the dance Bad vibes on zero National hero, soon as i reach the dance Cause no guns zero It don't cost, last last Now everybody go chop break fast
