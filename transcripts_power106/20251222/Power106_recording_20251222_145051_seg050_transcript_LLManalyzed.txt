20251222 145051 Supreme Court for the grant of probate. Once probate is granted, we then move on to getting the estate TRN. So each estate has to have a TRN once it's being probated. If it's being administered, that's when you die without a will, the estate needs an estate TRN. We then have to make an application to the tax administration in Jamaica, that's the stamp office, for an assessment of estate duties. That takes several months. Once that's done and paid, if there's anything to be paid, we'll get the relevant documents from the stamp office. And then we move on to the last stage, which is the titles office. And that's where the executor's name is put on the title. Now, it's at this stage where the executors name is put on on the title that the executor can finalize their sale because obviously the executor cannot finalize the sale unless their name is on the title. And for those of you who may not be familiar with this, it is perfectly legal for the executors name to go on the title.
