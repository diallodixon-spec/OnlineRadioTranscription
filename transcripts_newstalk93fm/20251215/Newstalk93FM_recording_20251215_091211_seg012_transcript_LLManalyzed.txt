20251215 091211 Another year has passed and I can't erase The memory of your smiling face So I had to call you up and say Gee whiz, it's Christmas So don't forget the party that we're throwing The warm fire from the fireplace will be glowing. It's been a long, long time. I still can't figure out why you crossed my mind. I guess it's just to say Gee whiz, it's Christmas I'm wishing you a Merry Have a Merry Merry Christmas
