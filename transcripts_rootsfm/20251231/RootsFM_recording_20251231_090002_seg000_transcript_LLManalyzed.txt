20251231 090002 The time by roots 96.1 FM is nine o'clock. When life gives you ordinary juice, you reach for extraordinary flavor. Langer's cranberry juice, bold, tangy, and bursting with real fruit goodness. It's packed with vitamin C and that crisp, refreshing taste that wakes up your taste buds with every sip. Whether you're cooling down by the beach, powering through your work day, or mixing up your favorite weekend drink, Langer's.1 presents Vibes and a Bird. It's 30 minutes of emotions becoming words. It buzzes into performance through poetry. Here poets express themselves using the spoken word and be in awe by their process of thought. Vibes and birds. With me Dion Davies. Each Wednesday at 6pm on 6pm.
