on Mary because as tenants in common, John can will his share to his children. If John knows without a doubt that he wants his share to go to Mary, there is no question as to what he wants to do with his share, then perhaps joint tenants will be the better option. So what do you want to happen to your share in the event you die before the other person? If you want the other person to get it, perhaps join Tenancy. If you want to be able to will it to someone else, perhaps Tenancy in common. If there is any doubt at all, you're not sure what you want to do, then go with Tenancy in common, because with Tenancy in Common, you could just make your will and will it to the same person, to the other person you're entitled with, or you could will it to whoever you want. If there's any doubt, perhaps tenants in common is the better option for you. But like I said, it is a personal decision. As an attorney, I will tell you the characteristics of each type of tenancy.
