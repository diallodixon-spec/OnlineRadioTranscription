to find the back of the net. What I've seen is players over the years, like when she was here in her early days, she played against Barbican, although we beat her a bit, but we had players on the pitch who you could say talent-wise is above her. But her opportunity came when she went to university, went to high school in the USA, and then went to university, and she never looked back. Now, you and I know that talent is not it all. That mentality on the international scene plays a very significant role in your success and I think that is where Bonnie Shaw has excelled above a lot of the female players here. Whereas you might find players here who could match her skill for skill or even a little bit better, few not a lot. Her mentality has been superb. I mean when you see her playing for Manchester City and the sort of dominance and how she plays the game, that fight, that determination.
