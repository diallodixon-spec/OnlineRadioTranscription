20251218 124539 When my family goes for clarity, you don't want to hear the price of the people they put on or something. But what's worse, I hear half of the things they're missing, and I don't sell customs. Girl, how you don't sell customs? At least I stop going like I don't have any sense. You don't see everybody I talk about it in the media. You don't want to stop listening to hearsay? You ever experience that? Customs don't go in your package, suitcase, barrel or cargo unless you will ship the item or the agent stand up right there when they inspect it. Listen, customs job is to protect the borders, collect revenue and to facilitate trade. They don't collect or store shipment, they inspect it and somebody has to present represented for inspection. So how customs ever get so much cussing then? Tracy, and the customs alone involved in the clearance process you know, even though it's them we tend to talk about. Look at it this way, shipment delayed, talk to your airline agent. Missing items, talk to your freight forwarder.
