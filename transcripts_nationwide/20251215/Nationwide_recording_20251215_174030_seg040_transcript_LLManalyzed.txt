20251215 174030 of 40, I can't say, but I think that we are seeing a gradual reduction and what I expect is that the more murders we prevent is the more murders you will prevent and it will have a multiplier effect that will gradually bring down major crime, major violent crimes, because that's how you bring down violent crime, but also we have to continue to do all the other things correctly that we are doing that have brought about this reduction in major crimes, particularly in murder. SSB Brooks, this is not a gradual reduction. 43% over last year is not gradual. On the back of a 19% over 8% the previous year, that's not gradual. I think that is what is raising a lot of dialogue and questions. Is this sustainable? Do we expect another 40-odd percent decline
