In reality, it's really just a matter of protocol, folks. So it's not as if the prime minister has gone to Mars. I mean, it's just in New York. If it's necessary, you can still run things from there. I wouldn't really worry about it. What you should be saying is, why does a prime minister have a junior minister or a minister of state in the Ministry of National Security in the name of Juliet Cuthbert, why isn't she assuming the responsibilities of national security now that the minister is incapacitated? Where is the prime minister after his grandstanding in our parliament? His behaviour is unbecoming of a leader. That's from Paul. The Prime Minister has declared war against his own people. What can go so?
