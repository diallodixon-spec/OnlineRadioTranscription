20260101 130603 I'm going to pick Whiskey over that one. And the good odds at 11 to 1 is Bob the Builder. I think this horse ran some good races earlier in the year. And I think he's rounding back into form. So Bob the Builder, number 7, at 11 to 1, is a good pick to upset the apple cart. We just have a few left to go in, numbers 2 and number 8 left to in number two comes up quietly the jockey will mount on number eight that is further and beyond the favorite and Then we should be ready for race number two. Let's take it over now for the live call This is race number two. Start of the way in Timmel. Not quite satisfied with something in one of the gates.
