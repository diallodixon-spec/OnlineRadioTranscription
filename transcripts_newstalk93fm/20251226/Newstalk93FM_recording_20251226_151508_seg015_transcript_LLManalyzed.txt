20251226 151508 I just want you to come and ride it up Just a little ride there now Come and meet me at the end of the truck and we rev it up Say hold it, keep throwing it back I know where your stuff goes up Baby no way, we could post up all the pictures you want When you're ready, I could overshare Lolly, you could overshare But we could meet in the middle and start a bacchanal Play in the middle hey, what we gonna do now? Jam to a rhythm, heat a carnival. What we gonna do? Start a wine on it. I say compromise on it. Baby, spend time on it. I said compromise on it. Oh!
