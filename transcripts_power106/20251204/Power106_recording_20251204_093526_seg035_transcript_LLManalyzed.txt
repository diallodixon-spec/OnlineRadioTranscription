FDI and 12 million grand package Jamaica received recently before taking their calls during the final segment of the show. As usual, we'll have our regular market updates, but for some, they brought unimaginable loss. Homes destroyed, lives disrupted, and communities cut off from each other. For decades, the RGR Gliener Communications Group has answered the call in times of crisis. Through the RG Cares Foundation, that spirit of compassion continues. We invite you to stand with us and support our brothers and sisters in need.
