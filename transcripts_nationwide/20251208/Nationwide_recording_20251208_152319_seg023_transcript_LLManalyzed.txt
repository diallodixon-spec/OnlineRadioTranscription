The statement details the extent of Dr. Henry's injuries noting that her fall caused an intracranial hemorrhage with loss of consciousness, a fracture, facial lacerations and other significant injuries. She was immediately taken to an intensive care unit in Bangkok, where she remained in critical condition under constant neurological monitoring and continues to require 24-hour specialist supervision, the statement said. The Miss Universe organization added that from the moment the incident occurred, it assumed a full and immediate responsibility without hesitation. It also stated that it has never attributed blame to Dr. Henry, calling any such suggestions unfounded and do not reflect the facts. The organization said it has covered all hospital, medical, and rehabilitation expenses in Thailand, as well as the accommodation and living costs for Dr. Henry.
