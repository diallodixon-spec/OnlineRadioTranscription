20251223 170403 Just like a script tonight It keeps me up all night I tell you How fun and tight this we have it Sweet woman we have it Greatest on the planet, boy Suck for the radio loud Playing a song and it goes in a fuck And if I lose myself inside this place Well I show my shit off Pimp this old cotton blast When the beat drop past the madness What's up? Just give me one more shot Inside my glass and love where we from We get these powers from this same nation Sweet like steel, drop the sweetest vibrations Don't let the rhythm get you just run, run
