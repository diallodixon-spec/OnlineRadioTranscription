Talk about the platforms now which we can access to. Oh absolutely, so all our platforms it will be on Power 106 live, it will be on HITS 92 live, this will be on TVJ, TVJ Sports Network, on OneSport Media globally and it will be available on one of the cable platforms We usually use one of two in the rest of the Caribbean So all of those and I think it will also be in socials on on the YouTube channel for TVJ as well
