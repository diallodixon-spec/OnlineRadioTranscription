I don't think that's the case, but I get what you're saying. It don't taste as good. You prefer the Jamaican KFC. All right, so Dwayne says his wife tried carrying up some KFC and it took it.

That's how much people love the KFC Jamaica. That's so much. Shout out to Cory over there in Boston and Cory said no sir, in and out. I only consume KFC in Jamaica and Guyana. That is it. Cause I heard about Guyana and Trinidad KFC. Heard that the KFC in Guyana and Trinity also tastes really really really really good.
