Passenger princess I've been, girl you knowin' what time it is Get on my lock, hit it, beat that **** out the box again Tryna see where your conscience is, can we keep this anonymous? Or you want me monogamous, or what? May take the world around, oh yeah You make it easy for me to believe in you love it You better believe it cause maybe I'm living with somethings Better than the d*** you had before Smiling cause you know I know you know I You better sell, I treat you well I will, it's good I can tell Come give me hell, come here Give me your favorite tale Under your spell, I am She gets your nails all the way, all the way You scream and yell, can't come for help, I'm here You leave in whelps, I feel your nails, hooray I hit you good
