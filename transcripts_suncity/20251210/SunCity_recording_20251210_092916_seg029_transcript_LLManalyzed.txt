The warp cannot manage it, Lord. So today we pray you provide more hands to help so that the people will see that their needs can be met and that, Lord, when their needs are met, they can lift up their hands and cry out to you and say, Abba Father, we thank you for what you've done for us. Lord, provide for them that the business owners, Lord God, their business not will go under, but it will flourish. Give them wisdom to be innovative in what they're doing. Lord, not that they put the prices up, but they bring them down in order to get more business. And through it, Lord God, they realize that wisdom is needed in this situation. For if they put the prices of Lord God, they cut off the people from purchasing. But but when the prices are more reasonable it can be purchased and their business would flourish give them the wisdom of God that they may know how to operate how to function and how to live because don't just live for today for tomorrow is another day
