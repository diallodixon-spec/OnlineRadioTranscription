20251231 130909 I knew I loved you then, but you'd never know It's like you played it cool and I was scared of letting go I knew I needed you, but I never showed But I wanna stay with you until we're brand old I'll take the kids to school, wave them goodbye And I'll thank my lucky stars for that night When we looked over your shoulder For a minute I forget that I'm older I wanna dance with you
