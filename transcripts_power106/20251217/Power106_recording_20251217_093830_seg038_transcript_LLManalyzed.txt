20251217 093830 is in a ship on the sea which has to be moved to safe harbor whenever there is a hurricane. So tell us, don't you believe that in going forward we should have more of the LNG storage on shore rather than offshore? Very important. And you know, I don't want to blame the people who engineered this particular project, but from day one we were concerned as to whether this project at Whole Harbour would have led to a reduction in the cost of electricity. We were told that we would go down to 17 cents and all of those. We still have 37 cents. My use bill for this month is 37.5 cents, which is not sustainable. What we're doing is we're taking medicine money, pension money, food money, and pay a light bill, and it is not sustainable.
