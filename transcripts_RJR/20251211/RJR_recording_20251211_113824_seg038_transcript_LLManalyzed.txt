The opposition wants light for the people. We want to ensure that we have 100% restoration of electricity. What we want, though, is credibility, because if the minister says in a statement written in Hansard that the JPSCo has reported that they can't achieve 100% restoration until they get $350 million. And the OUR at the PAAC says that they believe it is somewhere under $400 million. The Minister of Finance didn't have a clue. So if the Minister of Energy says that that was what JPSCOT told them, and so he was going to make a payment by way of a loan of $150 million, the logical question must be where we are going to get the balance.
