The record-breaking heat sum of 2023 and the long-term toll of sea level rise, we just don't have the science to measure those yet. This slide makes two things unmistakably clear. First, these interruptions are unpredictable. We never know which climate expression will strike or when. But secondly, they are unprecedented. On the one hand, some events like Melissa exceed anything in our recorded history. But taken cumulatively, the events are also unprecedented in frequency. They keep coming with little time in between to recover. Otherwise put, they repeatedly knock us off the development trajectory we thought we were on.
