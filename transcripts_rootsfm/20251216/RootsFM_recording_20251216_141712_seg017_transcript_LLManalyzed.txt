20251216 141712 I love the way you come out in your dress I wish we could share the same address Been watching your presentation And I want to be your only man I think you raise the bar There's no comparison I love you just the same We're gonna wheel and turn another turn But don't need no love, no way Relationships sailing off the ocean Never see no day We're gonna let them pass on it for days There is a place called love
