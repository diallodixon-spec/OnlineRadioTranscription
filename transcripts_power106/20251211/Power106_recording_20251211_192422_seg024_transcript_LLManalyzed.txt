2025-12-11 20:52:39 goes almost like clockwork. And we have to get it going so that we can run it on time and end on time. And that's actually one of the things that we push the envelope with respect to on time running of events. That athletes can get the maximum time to rest in between. Because one of the features of our need is that a lot of athletes, through the instructions of their coaches, do double events at this meet. So the short sprinters who would run 100, 200 normally, they would run the 150 meters and the 300 meter races at the meet. The people who run the 400 would run the 300 meter, which is the lower end of the scale, and then they run the meet. The people who run the 400 run the 300 meter which is the lower end of the scale and then they run the 600 so most of the athletes come to this meet and they do a double just as part of their time trial for you know training end of the preparation phase and they're doing this so we have to run the meet
