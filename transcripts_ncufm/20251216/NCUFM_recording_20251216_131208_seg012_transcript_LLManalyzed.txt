20251216 131208 Oh, God, please save me, save us all. Oh, Lord, please save me. Save us all. Save us, save us, save us now. Don't make me fall, change my life, and make easy Doubt will come, believe me Sometimes you'll wonder if it's alright Hold on tight, it's about to be a move When you see what God has taken I can't wait for you to tell me that it's alright Travel light and leave room for tomorrow
