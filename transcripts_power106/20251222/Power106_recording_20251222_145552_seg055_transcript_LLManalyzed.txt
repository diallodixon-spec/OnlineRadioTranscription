20251222 145552 What some persons are up to do too is to do a power of attorney. But of course, you know, something we talk about all the time. If you are doing a power of attorney, please ensure that it is done to the requirements of Jamaican law. So many persons spend their hard earned money doing a power of attorney overseas only to realize it's not valid when it gets to Jamaica. We have to have specific wording in our powers of attorney for them to be accepted, in particular when it comes to real estate transactions in Jamaica. So yes, someone can do a letter giving someone permission but just ensure it is worded properly and like I said you may also explore doing a power of attorney and it is best to have a Jamaican attorney to do those for you.
