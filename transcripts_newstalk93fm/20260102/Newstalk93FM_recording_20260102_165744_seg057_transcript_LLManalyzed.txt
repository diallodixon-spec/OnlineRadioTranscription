OK, so we're seeing where personal impact is not isolated from community narratives and economic ecosystems and the role played by events like the Potosphere because Potosphere is showing a lot of artisans from all around the island and if they are able to come, which is not the case for everybody, but if people are able to come to show up with some product, it's an income to them. An income to them is a direct income to community around because people spend the money where they are.
