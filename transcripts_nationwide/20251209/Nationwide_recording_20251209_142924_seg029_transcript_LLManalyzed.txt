It's so easy to fall in love with you The way I do my hair, the way I make you laugh The way we like to share or walk in central park I could be fresh air, might be the girl of your dreams There's no need to hide if you're into me Cause I'm into you, quite intimately You may be one that could turn into three with another You say that, you say that What you doin'? Where you at? Oh, you got plans? Don't say that I'm sippin' wine In a robe I look too good To be alone My house clean My pool warm Just shaved Smooth like a newborn We should be dancin'
