20251225 160709 She loves me now And I must have made her feel the same thing Just like Early in Sunday morning Yes, I took out my paper and decided to read For real, with a little voice, hey You might not remember me But I had one against with you And ever since the night we met I must tell you true You danced into my life Never out of my mind And now between me and my man it's all over And I just want us now to get closer She loves me, she loves me now
