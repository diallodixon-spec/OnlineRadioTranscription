But Gilbert blew them off and put them on the grass. Right? And they did the Kingston Pier in front of the digital building get damaged also. A ship used to come there and park up. Big ship used to come here and park up big ship used to come here and park up but from the pier get damaged by Gilbert them stop come there even the book ship you know they um did they love us love us yes hello yes them used to come right there so and park up but them start to go somewhere else now because them can't park here anymore because Gilbert damaged the dwarf itself 37 years ago right so it simply mean that all those damage you see take place down the west most of them not going to fix back
