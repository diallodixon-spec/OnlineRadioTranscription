20251226 163725 I'm miserable. All the money grown, I'm causing trouble. Look how the security watch me. They don't know I'm out there. And it's much a big place, and I defect like a jumping. And to one way, they don't want me in their party, they. They don't want me cause I do one way. They know I'm in their party. I don't listen, nothing to say. Every time draw Jumpin' up Doin' what I want Jumpin' up Tell them I ain't livin' Right they are sleepin' Every fact I draw They say I'm too out of control But there's too much action Somebody pour an extra Until my head gone And I'm miserable All down on the ground
