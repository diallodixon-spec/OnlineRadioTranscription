20251215 122121 In international news, federal and state government leaders in Australia on Monday agreed to immediately overhaul already tough national gun control laws. This after a mass shooting targeted a Hanukkah celebration on Sydney's Bondi Beach on Sunday, leaving at least 15 people dead and close to 40 injured. Those killed included a 10-year-old girl, a rabbi, and a Holocaust survivor. In a statement after an emergency meeting Monday, the nine leaders said the action would include renegotiating the landmark National Firearms Agreement that virtually banned rapid-fire rifles. The violence erupted at the end of a summer day when thousands had flocked to Bondi Beach, an icon of Australia's cultural life. The two suspected shooters, a 50-year-old man and his 24-year-old son, fired on the beachfront festivities. And that's it for the news at 12. Up next, sports.
