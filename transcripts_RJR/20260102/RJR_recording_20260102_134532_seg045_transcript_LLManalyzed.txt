20260102 134532 Help us out, we're going to take a break and come back back so we can get to the books. One is bountiful this time of year. Let's go. So much to do, so little time. Missed your Palav Hangout on Radio Jamaica 94 last Sunday? No worries. Let me give you the hookup. Okay, grab your phone. One, go to any app store. Two, find Radio Jamaica 94 FM. Three, download the app. It not take up much space. Trust me. Four, install and open. Five, open now. Look for a tiny computer screen icon labeled podcasts. It's at the bottom center. Six, Palav is the fourth from the top of the podcast page. Yes, Erie. Well, thank you so much for Palav-ing with us and withdrawing the long bench with a very special guest. So there you go.
