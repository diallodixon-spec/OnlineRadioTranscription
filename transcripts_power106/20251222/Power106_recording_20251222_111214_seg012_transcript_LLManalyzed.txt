20251222 111214 I struggle to listen to politicians. I honestly struggle because it just doesn't make sense to me. You're saying that somebody, let's say somebody's doing physio, right? You're saying the person ought to be doing better after they've had an accident. They ought to be doing in physio when in fact none of their muscles are working. Some of the utterances I hear from politicians often make me wonder what on earth they're talking about. Because the main reason so far that we've picked up, some of it anecdotally, some of it quite mainstream, is that the reason why people do not want to leave their house right they have they have a set of reasons the primary reason is they have a working idea of where you're taking them which is in a school to go sleep on the floor and so forth
