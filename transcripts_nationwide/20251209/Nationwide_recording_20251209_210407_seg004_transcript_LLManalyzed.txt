for us to say just the ideal woman if that woman is not what men want. So I would say the ideal woman for a relationship is one, the man has to find her attractive and two, she should be loyal, committed and faithful to the relationship because those are the two things men really look for a woman that you find attractive and one that is loyal And by the way, on an interview we are doing, so I just want anybody to feel at the point where they say, no man, you know how we do it around here, with us. Do it around here. Alright. So, are men right in saying that women don't know what they want? No.
