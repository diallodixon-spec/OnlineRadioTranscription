20251217 200606 As my weapon. Oh, oh, oh. They can't stop the way I feel for you. My love has no boundary. They can't bully the way I feel. I fight for you when you fight for me. Can't stop the way they wish and them hope and them fight and them pray. Can't stop this warrior love. Living in a house with a bed and I broke the fridge. I was there. I make is a good woman That's who I live to be. You seem to be pleased with who I am, cause you're the strongest man I've ever seen. I'm a whole lot of woman, full of everything a lover's worth.
