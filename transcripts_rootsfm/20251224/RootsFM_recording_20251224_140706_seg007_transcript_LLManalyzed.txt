20251224 140706 Yeah, and that is this one song that I know everybody know Whether you young or you're old All bells Jingle it all the way Oh what fun it is To ride in a one-horse open sleigh Dashing through the snow On a one-horse-open sleigh Over the hill we go Laughing all the way Bells on bobtails ring Making spirits bright How funny it is to whine and sing a slaying song tonight Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle bells
