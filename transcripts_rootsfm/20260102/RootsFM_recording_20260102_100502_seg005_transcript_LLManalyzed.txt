What the mind can conceive and believe it can achieve through love, wisdom, commitment, focus, action, over-standing, I and I must achieve a spiritual renaissance, economic revitalization, and mastery of a substance. The Zandifada, the Earthly Mother, and I, I, One. Health, wealth, and prosperity are I and I natural birthright. Blessed be the union that brings us abundance and opulence in all things divine.
