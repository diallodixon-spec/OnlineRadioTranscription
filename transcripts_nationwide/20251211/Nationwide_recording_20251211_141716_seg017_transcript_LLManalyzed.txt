I played around like I was free Thought I could have my cake and eat it too But how I cried over losing you See, I'm coming home Hired up, I took on living my life without you Every day, I made you cry I prayed, and girl, till the day I die I'll be working my way back to you babe With a burning love inside Yeah, I'm working my way back To you babe And the happiness that dies I'll let it take you away Nationwide, 9tfm
