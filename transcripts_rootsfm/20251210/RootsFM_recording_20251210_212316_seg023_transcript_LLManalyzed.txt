============================================================

Quite the way you touched me People search a lifetime To find what we have You are the love of my life One thing that's good in this life And I'll spend the rest of my days Just loving you You are the love of my life The heart and soul of my life Once I was lost and alone With you at last I am home You give me so much of you And leave me room to be free No one's ever touched me Quite the way you touch me
