20251229 130002 To show you there's nothing I won't do Maybe I'll walk around and shine a wall for you There's a way I'll do it all for you Anything you want me to do You know I'll do People think I'm crazy They say I'm just a nothing Letting my life pass me by Believing you with me But I can't speak for no one In my heart I know you love me yes And that's why I always tell you, oh, oh, oh. I'll travel around the seven seas for you. It's written in the melody. I adore you. Oh, my love.
