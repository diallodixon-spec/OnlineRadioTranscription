I have been waiting on you So put my weight on on you This dance with me save it for you That's why I've been waiting on you If If you ask me for marriage, I will certainly say I do. But this I love with no average. Every day is a honeymoon. I will search any parish, cross any border, swim any sea. And I'm not being dramatic. We're so organic Love that for me is the tip I'm not lying, me not telling no, baby, that's for real Is that crime or you making me crazy?
