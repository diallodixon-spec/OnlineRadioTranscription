Then before I make an alarm. But now that I heard at least three calls coming in now doing the same thing. Yes. Yes. But Flo, what is happening when it's here? People don't know what is happening. Not just in the channels. What is it? What accounts for that? I find that it's always better in custom relations. There's an issue. Address it upfront and quickly. All right? And see how it can be resolved if it can be. When persons are left to wonder what is happening, it's not good. I'm not glad to hear that the folks are having problems. I'm glad to know that you've got something with my mind. Yes, I understand. You see, the thing about it, home entertainment, and especially when there are those amongst us. I would never put you in that category.
