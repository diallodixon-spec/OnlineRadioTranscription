20251219 195244 We have restrictions on how we can move money across borders. No, why are you going to something that you refuse? It doesn't make sense. There are a lot of restrictions on Jamaica moving money across borders because people outside of Jamaica put a lot of restrictions on Jamaica moving money across the border because people outside of Jamaica put a lot of restriction on us because especially because of the scamming culture, the different things that have happened. So they ask for a lot of stuff and moving money out of online accounts their own. Most Jamaicans, I will tell you that they do a lot of stuff to get people who earn money online, YouTuber, these places have to find ways to get the money, the actual money that they have earned.'t just put it into an account here you have to go to a lot of paperwork and transfer here and there because it is not allowed easily from those areas into a Jamaican bank account so so ma Charlie I don't know what to tell you but I'm sorry
