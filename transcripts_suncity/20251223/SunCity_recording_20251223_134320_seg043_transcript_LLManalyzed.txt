20251223 134320 I'm talking to myself, and you don't even notice. She got me feeling like a zombie. I should have shoot that truck down. The way she put that body down. You got me falling truly. I just touched down star When I see you down Slippin' on the road Calling you tonight I wanna make you sure Make me know the fight I don't wanna sleep alone Wanna hold you tight But I fold eyes, when I'll be alright, forever. They don't feel it, they don't need that, they don't want it.
