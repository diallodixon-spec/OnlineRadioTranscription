20251222 194125 Don't care about the present Underneath the Christmas tree I don't need to end my stocking Live upon the fireplace Santa Claus won't make me happy With a toy I don't miss a thing I just want you for my own More than you could ever know Make my wish come true Oh This Christmas I won't even wish for snow I'm just gonna keep on waiting Underneath the mistletoe I will make a list and send it To the North Pole for singing I won't even stay awake tonight
