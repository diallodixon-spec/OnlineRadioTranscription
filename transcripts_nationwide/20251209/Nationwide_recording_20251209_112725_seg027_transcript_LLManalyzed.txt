we were the only game in town because of course of the quality of what we sold. The Japanese were really willing to pay premium dollar but now they have an alternative to Jamaica and they have other places where they're getting supply from so they don't need to pay premium dollar for our product because they'll tell you that they'll get something similar somewhere else for cheaper so I can't give $12,000 a box again, you have to come better. I will drop and drop and drop until we get $12,000 a box, you get a bag of fertilizer for $3,000. Right now if you know $10,000, $9,000 you can get a bag of fertilizers. Yes. You understand? Yes.
