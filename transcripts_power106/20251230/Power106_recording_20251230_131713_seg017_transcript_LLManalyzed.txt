20251230 131713 Hey, welcome back everyone. Welcome back. Somebody here says Dr. Galen Ralston. I love you guys humor and approach to the logic you presented. I remember how my neighbor's roof blew off and he was laughing so much that made me sad whose roof was intact. So I started laughing too. My neighbor prevented me from falling into depression. LOL. Yeah, that's how it goes. So when things get really bad, you have to laugh. You have to take some of the pressure off the amygdala. Yes? The emotional center, which is located just behind the eyes and in the brain. Yeah, you have to take the pressure off. You laugh. You allow the system a little space to just reboot because believe me in this country if you take everything too seriously you're gonna die, you're gonna die you're not made that you're gonna die. Albert how you doing? Alton how you doing?
