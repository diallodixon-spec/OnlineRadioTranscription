I mean, they can say whatever they want to say, but you can't compel someone to prove ownership or to prove that they have permission to be on someone's property. If we were to do that, we would be seriously infringing on people's civil liberties. Even as a landowner, let's say I am at my house and someone turns up. What if I don't have my requisite documents? Or what if I just don't want to show you? I get where you're coming from, but I don't know how practical that would be. Like I said, certainly, it would breach a whole host of rights. But the bigger issue, I think, in this is that a lot of us still rely too much on the government.
