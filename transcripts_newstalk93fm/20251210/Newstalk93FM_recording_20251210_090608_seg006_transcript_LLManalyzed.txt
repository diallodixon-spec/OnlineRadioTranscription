============================================================

You can't see me dreaming, but I'm sure someday you'll understand. It can all be better if we get it together and dream, dream, dream. I have a dream that someday we will all walk hand in hand I have a dream That someday This is going to be a better land Maybe you can't see my meaning You can't see my dream But I'm sure someday you'll understand It can all be better When we get it together
