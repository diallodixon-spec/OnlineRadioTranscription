20251226 101010 I'll be your father figure I drink that brown liquor I can't make deals with you down Because my check's bigger This love is pure profit Just step into my office I dry your tears with my sleeve Leave it with me I protect the family Leave it with me, I protect the family I pay the check before it kisses the mahogany grain Said they wanna see you rise, they don't want you to rain I showed you all the tricks of the trade. All I ask for is your loyalty, my dear protege. I'll be a father figure. I drink that brown liquor.
