============================================================

Don't complain Sometimes it may seem like I can't make it all But I'm gonna wait, yes I'm gonna wait Until my change comes He may not come when I call him But he's always on time. Oh, I'm gonna wait. He's gonna work it out. You'll see. I believe with all of my heart.
