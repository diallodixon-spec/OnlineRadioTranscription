20251215 160805 I'm calling on masqueraders, anybody with time I have something that I want to tell you Been a while on the mind, we sharing this road together This stage not too far behind, this one goes out to every friend To discuss your behavior, when you reach the road Get on like like a catcher coming. Advertise the mode. Jump up, this is one from Ali, the fan of the year. Inside the air, bump the finest. Display it yourself, like we don't care about nobody. Out on the road, all by the step. All in the crowd, we're ready to go.
