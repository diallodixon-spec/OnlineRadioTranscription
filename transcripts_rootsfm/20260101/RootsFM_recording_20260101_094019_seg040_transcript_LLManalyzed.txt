20260101 094019 This thing called love, get away from you. Feel free right now, go do what you want to do. Can't let nobody take it away from you, from me, from me. No time for moping around, are you kidding? And no time for negative vibes, cause I'm waiting. It's been a long week, I put in my hardest. Gonna live my life, feel so close to get it right. So I like when I see, when I'm looking at you, when I'm walking past the mirror. Don't stress through the night at a time when my life ain't worried about if you feel it. Got my head on straight, I got the vibe right. I ain't gonna let you kill it. See, I won't chase my life, my life. Just fight, Fight, fight, fight, fight. Fight. Fight, fight fight, fight fight. Just fight, fight fight fight, fight. I won't change, I won't change. My life, my life, just fight.
