So yes, it's so nice to have people in the studio, but yes, she is here and she's going to explain why it's so important to get your party permits in advance and, you know, process getting it all done. So, you know, she's going to also help both promoters and patrons as well to know their rights and responsibilities So this conversation is especially important for anyone planning to do an event over the season as well as residents concerned about safety noise and order in their communities So welcome welcome deputy superintendent Tony and fair on how are you this morning? Hey, good morning. I am doing great and thanks for having me. Governor, how are you? Well, I'm sitting beside a beautiful woman and I don't know why you change the seating arrangement. I didn't change it. Look at me.
