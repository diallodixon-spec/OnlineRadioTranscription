This is an opportunity to reset the housing and community layout situation which is a cause for this massive problem at this time by creating community with spaces needed for communities to thrive without the need for constant handouts from government. It also requires standards for everyone to adhere to. If we build back in the same manner as before, we are applying medication to a wound without cleaning it. I hope this helps. There are more educated professionals in Jamaica who are not party loyalists that are eager to work together to rebuild Western Jamaica. We can probably retain the same team to do the rest of the country after this set up is running on its own. The solution requires leadership not what is in the parliament at this time. Those are career politicians whose aim is to make names and money for themselves
