history. Truly a blessing. I'm happy for the upbringing. And of course, Vertec put the icing on the cake when I got the opportunity to go there. And even before I talk about Vertec, I have to talk about my elementary school in Jamaica with a bit of age. I believe Roy Henry was my first coach there and would just send us to, didn't know too much about coaching, but he would just send us many of maybe PE days to go pick, run to a tree somewhere and pick the trees to make sure we did it and come back and just very much help us to start where we are and get to VIR and VIRTEC, you know is and still is and I'm boasting the only high school to produce the most Olympian out of high school. I have a rich history I love it and I will always talk about it. I don't know even where to start there's so much there but I love that
