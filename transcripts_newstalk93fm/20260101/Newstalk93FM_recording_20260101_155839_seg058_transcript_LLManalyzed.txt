And I believe somehow, there ain't no perfect play. Finally, she wants to come and stay. Can't wait wait another day And now I don't feel so far away 41 days 42 nights 43 nights 44 tries I must say it felt a kind of way But it was only you in my eyes I felt pain when you ref were afraid. First time I asked you your name. Now you're in my domain and you're staying. And it got me saying, I ain't gonna leave. She loves, she loves me now. And I believe.
