20251215 110203 Stocks opened lower this morning as investors wait for some overdue economic data. NPR's Scott Horsley reports the Dow Jones Industrial Average was flat in early trading.

The Labor Department reports tomorrow on job gains for October and November. We'll also get a look at November's inflation rate on Thursday. Some of the missing data will not be made up, though. Furloughed federal workers were unable to conduct price checks or tally the unemployment rate for October, so for the first time, there will be gaps in those long-running series. The maker of Roomba, the self-driving vacuum cleaner, is filing for bankruptcy. The company, called iRobot, will be sucked up by its main contract manufacturer. Scott Horsley, NPR News, Washington. On Wall Street, the Dow is now down about 27 points. The Nasdaq is down more than 60 points. You're listening to NPR.
