You're listening to Cruisin' on NCUFM. For anything to fill your heart Love that was inside Is far away when the pain stops And the day has become dark And everything's falling apart now But God is good So taste and see that the Lord is good, so taste and see that the Lord is good. Taste and see that the lord is good. Try him now, one thing's for sure, he will never forsake you.
