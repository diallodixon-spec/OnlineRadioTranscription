============================================================

I'll be higher than anyone can count. Knowing to be bound of love I have. And you've inspired what love is all about. Girl, I can't live without your love. Two kisses for you. That's an anew. Heaven is on my side. Forever we are. Two separate stars. Sharing one common light. Yeah're the one and the price. You're the winner, you're gonna win. I love you higher than anyone can doubt.
