20251229 130103 this morning fatally shot during an intelligence-led operation by the police in Augustown. The deceased is Deandre Williams, also called Yankee, and street life of Nanny Boulevard in Nannyville, St. Andrew. A 9mm Taurus pistol with a magazine containing 10 cartridges was reportedly seized from Williams, who was also said to be a top-tier member of two gangs. Eighteen men aligned to the African Gardens Vietnam Gang were also apprehended and taken into custody during the operation. Amid public criticism over the length of the two-year investigation into fraud allegations at investment firms, stocks and Securities Limited SSL, the security agencies leading the probe say the charges laid over the weekend are the result of extensive financial investigations and coordinated multi-agency efforts. Investigators say the SSL investigation commenced in 2023 after the laying of fraud-related charges against former SSL employee Jean Ann Panton in February of that year.
