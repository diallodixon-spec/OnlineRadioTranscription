20251231 114226 Yeah, I wrote this song. And I pray that you listen to all the words. Because I feel like at some point in everybody's life, you feel like this. Lord, I'm split in two. Part of me loves the world and the other loves you. So what do I do? I want to be safe, but I got to stay cool too. And no, I'm not a fool I know eventually I'm gonna have to choose And really I don't wanna lose My ticket in the heaven and a chance to be used by you And if it's God that I'm after I just can't serve two masters And before something happens I gotta turn it all around Because I know I can't just have my cake and eat it too Cause it's real easy to stay on the fence and still do you
