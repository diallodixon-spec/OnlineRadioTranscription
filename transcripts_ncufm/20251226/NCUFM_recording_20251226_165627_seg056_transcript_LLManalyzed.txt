20251226 165627 I must say. I never really understood what Boxing Day was about until today. I thought it was just an extra day in all it is but it's more than that. It's a day where we focus and commemorate giving you know the joy of helping others the same way you know just spreading the love and the joy that has been afforded to us by our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ So my thought for this afternoon or to take us into the Sabbath It says on Boxing Day Let us remember the joy of giving and the blessings of generosity, because true happiness is found not in what we receive, but in what we share with others.
