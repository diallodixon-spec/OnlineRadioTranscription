20251223 141915 Something's got a hold on me lately Though I don't know myself anymore Feels like the walls are all closing in And the devil's knocking at my door Out of my mind, how many times did I tell you I'm no good at being alone Yeah, it's taking a toll on me Trying my best to keep from taping the skin off my bones Don't you know how to control When you're not next to me I'm falling apart right in front of you, can't you see? I'm losing control
