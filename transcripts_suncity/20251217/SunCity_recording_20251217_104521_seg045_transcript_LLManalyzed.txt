20251217 104521 Oh, you bless my heart so abundantly. Day of a diary, I give you the glory. My life is so worth my living. And my love, I keep on giving. Oh, oh, oh. Oh, Father, I love you more than words can ever say. Oh, Yahweh, I need you, each and every day. Oh, Father, I know the world's gonna see. Oh, God, when I need you, each and every day, well, you love me.
