20251230 160603 I knew that love would bring this happiness I'm being I tried to keep my sanity I waited patiently Girl, you know it seems my life is so complete I love you too, because of you You're doing what you do You got my world, you know you did. Come on, come on, come on. Come on and get it. The rarest love we can find. The one I'd like you to come find. You got my world. You know you did. The rarest thing we can do again. The rareest love we can find, the one I'd like to come find.
