I'm vanilla, baby But I ain't no new baby She 28, tellin' me I'm still a baby I can love Detroit like Skilla, baby And the thing about your boy is Young J-A-C-K-A Rico like suave Young Enrique speakin' her A She's an alpha but not around your boy She can cry around your boy Hold on, don't know what you heard or what you thought about your boy But they lied about your boy, going dumb and it's something idiotic about your boy She now I see you, I get you, take it now Slow down, be cool, I miss you Come here now, it's yours now, keep it
