============================================================

Always together forever I will love you till the day I die I know this now and my love won't run dry You came along, my life has begun Two hearts on a beating as though they were one Like the stars that make the night so bright You shine on me with a love that's so right A love that is lasting A love that's so pure Each time I feel it It makes me more sure I know With all my heart We'll never part For this is the day when our love comes alive And I mean what I say as I stand here saying I pledge my love to you
