20260101 200102 then dip me under way you can feel my brain will flow and flow call me to cross green forever breathe and wash me over until my will runs dry tonight i'll sing a lullaby baby hard rock steady steady rock rock steady rock rock steady Don't you know that I give you the lovin' if you need it. I give you my word, you can believe it. Your love feels like all for us. He's only growing inside me.
