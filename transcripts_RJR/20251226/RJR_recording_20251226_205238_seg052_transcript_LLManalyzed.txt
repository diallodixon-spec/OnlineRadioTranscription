20251226 205238 I love you from now to the next few lifetimes. I give thanks for every face, man. Fall apart, beat, motor, free up your space, man. I feel like me have a leprechaun in all my pockets. And while the streams come through the universal pocket, whoa. We haven't sinned, we no star-crossed. Venus, I'm a guy, you want my heart-crossed. The two of us, we're like heroes and psychs. Together, we're out of the fight. It's only natural for this There ain't nothing like a good love story That brings tears to your eyes And moves on making better signs Since you found that 40th love
