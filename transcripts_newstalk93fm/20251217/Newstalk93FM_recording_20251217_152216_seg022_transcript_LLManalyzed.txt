20251217 152216 I wanna hold you so tight, so tight, come in closer It's been a hell of a ride, but every single moment You were there by my side Whenever I'm broken, you make me feel low Whenever I'm lonely, you're there for my soul Wherever you are, girl, that's why i call my own whenever you doubt it i'll be letting you know oh girl i want to be dancing with you forever you see through the storm and take me as i am baby it's magic anytime that we're together I make her just love you and hold you for my hand Hold you for my hand
