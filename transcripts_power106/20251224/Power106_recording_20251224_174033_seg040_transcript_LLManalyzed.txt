20251224 174033 I'll get you yet, you old bag. Day 12. Listen, slurry head, you have ruined our lives. The twelve maidens dancing turned up last night and beat the living daylights out of the eight maids of Milken because they found them carrying on with the eleven lords of Lepen. Meanwhile the swans got out of the living room where they'd been hiding since the big battle and savaged hell out with the lords and all the maids. There were eight ambulances here last night and the local civil defense as well. The mother is in a home for the bewildered and I'm sitting here up to me neck in bird's droppings, empty whiskey and valium bottles, bird's blood and feathers when the flaming cows eats the leaves off the pear tree. I'm a broken man.
