20251224 173219 is 28 degrees Celsius in Montego Bay and 28 degrees Celsius in Kingston. Thank you so much for staying with us for our special Christmas Eve program. What a year, what a year. What a year. Listen now, I've been working on year in review, right? Which is going to be airing as we usually do the first working day of the year, which is next week, Friday. And I was talking to everybody and we were saying, okay, what happened this year? And everybody was drawing a blank. It's as if we have hurricane amnesia. Nobody can remember nothing apart from Melissa and they say oh yeah the election although the election feels like it was a long time ago. Nobody, I am not kidding you, nobody can remember nothing. They say what and then I'm saying so and so happened.
