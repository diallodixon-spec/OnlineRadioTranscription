20260101 092216 We're the couple, but nobody ever made me feel safe like you. Because when I'm with you, I just know I'm fine. You take all the pressure off my mind all the time. Patient in time will not be going out my mind. Say from the problems, I don't worry because I'm hard to find. Safe like I just ran and slid across the plate. Safe like we playing in your home base safe like I got a big dog in the gate safe like you one of these play in my face yeah you know I know you know that I'm that right you got a girl that wanna get right when I spass and I crash you ain't gon' dip right that's when I need you the most that's how I get right Baby, if I'm safe in your arms, I feel safe Saved like the money let it sit up in the bank Saved like a cold with the alarm, I feel safe Nobody got right by my side so high I don't need a rich bitch Just somebody that can make me feel safe
