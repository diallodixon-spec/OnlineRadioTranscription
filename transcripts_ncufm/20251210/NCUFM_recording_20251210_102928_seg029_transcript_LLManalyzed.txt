When we protect the dignity and fairness in our health system, we build a stronger and more compassionate Jamaica and upholding the rights of one person strengthens the rights for everyone. So as we treat each other with care and justly and with respect, it should spread and that's what we should happen. And no one should come into our space and leave feeling less than or that they are not valued or they're not important. We're here to provide health care and we have to do it in such a manner that when people leave or health facilities they feel respected they do they access care and feel like this with some sort of dignity. Perfect. Thank you so much for sharing all of that with us, Mrs. Patricia Russell. She is the program coordinator for the prevention component of the HIV STI TB unit within the Ministry of Health and Wellness. It was great sharing with you today, Mrs. Russell. Thank you for having me. Thank you. I'm sure
