20251229 185431 I'll be shining like I'm born to be Cause we are hunters, voices strong and I know I believe We're going up, up, up, it's our moment You know together we're glowing Gonna be, gonna be golden Up fears, no lies Let's who we're part of it You know we're gonna be, gonna be golden We're gonna be gonna be Wanna be, wanna be glowing Like every night on the day You know that it's the sun's time, no fears Don't lie say it's true We're part of it
