20251229 132115 At 12, you greet somebody, good morning. It doesn't mean that the sun is shining, it's just a convenience. It's just a binary because human beings are trapped in binaries. They like two things. They like morning and evening. They like male and female. They like black and white. But no binary exists anywhere at all. But as humans, we like binaries because it makes our lives very simple okay so so a person greeting you as good morning at 1201 1201 in the night it's just a convenience it's a cultural convenience
