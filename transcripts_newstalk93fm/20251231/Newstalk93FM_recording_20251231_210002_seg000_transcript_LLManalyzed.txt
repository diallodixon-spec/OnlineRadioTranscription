20251231 210002 gonna leave me baby go and leave me all the way they say the holy water's watered down and this town's lost its faith our colors will fade eventually so if our time is running out day after day we'll make the mundane our masterpiece oh my my oh my my love i take my look at you you're taking me out of the ordinary aren't you laying me down to the dead and buried. On the edge of your knife, staying drunk on your ride. The angels up in the clouds are jealous knowing we've found something so wild. For the ordinary, you got me kissing the ground. For the sanctuary, you shattered me with your touch. Oh Lord, return me to dust.
