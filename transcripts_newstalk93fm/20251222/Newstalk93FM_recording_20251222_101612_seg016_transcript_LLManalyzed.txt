20251222 101612 Fireflies lighting our way as we walk Words floating in the summer breeze when we talk What we have is endless Take away all my stress It's so familiar and still so brand new Every day with you feels like deja vu Like we've always known it Loved you before we met. This is a fact. Our love is like summertime. Heal it, my man. Our love is, like, summertime. Ooh, feels so cool to me. Kiss me, always, from sunlight to moon rays, January to December. Loving you is summer forever. Stars shine on us.
