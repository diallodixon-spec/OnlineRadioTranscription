We have a few minutes to close out for today, and it's now 11.45, and the gleaner is also carrying out its front page here, where Kingston Technical Principal has been suspended, and what is it saying here? It's saying that, a comment here, Carla, just one one second principal of Kingston Technical High School Martin Campbell has been suspended from the institution following an audit report concerns over hiring decision and formal complaint submitted by a board member so we are watching that one to see how that will basically end up as well. Hello, Carla. Thanks for calling. Good morning, Mr. O'Brien. Hi, good morning. How are you doing so? I'm not too bad. Very quickly. I don't have much time, neither do you, but very quickly.
