20251225 124033 Let me down again Cause I'm depending on you So you better come through this time Please hear my cry and if I ever Let you down my friend It was a misunderstanding So I thought you'd keep it back then And I promise from today I'll go jump Like I never jump Waved like I high We are not in the sky Taste running down we high Can't you tell that we sorrow We sorrow And we need you back in we high Come on to me, come on to me Come on to me I, I need time, no place like home
