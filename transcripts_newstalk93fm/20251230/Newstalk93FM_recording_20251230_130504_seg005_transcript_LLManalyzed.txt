20251230 130504 We ain't going nowhere Like we ain't leaving this place When I'm feeling under the weather You just make me feel sweet Ice the cocoa tea, use the sugar And together we are complete, darling Heat me up Only you alone can put fire back in my soul Heat me up And they're telling me I shouldn't leave that fire alone
