feel the spirit moving in my heart I pray I tell the world I'm gonna lay down my burden down by the riverside lay down down by the river side lay on down down by the riverside I'm going to lay down my burden Down by the riverside study for no No more war. We come with love to heal the nation. We sing them songs of inspiration. Songs of up-pulled qualification. Good vibration, rock the nation. The rhythm of a laughing and me heart a beat. It make you want jump up out of your seat. Move up your body and stomp your feet you. And before it finishes, you will want to sing it.
