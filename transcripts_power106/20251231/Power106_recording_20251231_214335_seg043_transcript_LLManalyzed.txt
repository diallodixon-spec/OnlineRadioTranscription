20251231 214335 Here I am like a brand new man Last night with you, I put me back in line Can't wait to see you up and around, can't wait to see When you break that smile, I mean love Feel it in my heart, I mean love I mean love, I feel it all over If you see me hand over heels Don't worry about you took the load out of me I never thought I'd open up But the woman you make me feel so free I mean love, feel it in my heart I mean love
