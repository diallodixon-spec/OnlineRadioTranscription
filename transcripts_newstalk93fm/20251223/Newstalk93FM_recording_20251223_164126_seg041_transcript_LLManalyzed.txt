20251223 164126 If I ever let you down, my friend, it was a misunderstanding. So I thought you'd get forgotten. Don't I promise from today I'll go drunk like I never drunk, waved like I never waved, whined like I never won before, just to show you I'm sorry, I'm sorry. And I need you back in my life. Look at people by the truck, emotions running high. We are not in the sky, tears running down we eyes. Can't you tell that we sorrow? We sorrow, and we need you back in we eyes. Come on to me, come on to me. Come on to me. This is my apology.
