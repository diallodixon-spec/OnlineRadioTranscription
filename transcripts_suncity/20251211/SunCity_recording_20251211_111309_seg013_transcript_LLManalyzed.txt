I'm blue All I want for Christmas is you I don't want a lot for Christmas There is just one thing I need Don't care about the present Underneath the Christmas tree I don't need to hang my jacket There upon the fireplace Santa Claus won't make me happy With a toy on Christmas day I just want you for my own More than you could ever know Make my wish come true All I want for Christmas is you
