serious seasons of my life because of Uncle Chris and There wasn't that there wasn't a stone that was left unturned. I mean from the start of the season We we had one of the best simulators practicing on we had the best nutrition coaches best physiotherapist best Anything you could think of Uncle Chris made sure both of us were doing it and I can safely say his role was even bigger than my own throughout the whole season. So don't let him fool you where he says it was just his experience. It was much more than that. And to your question about realizing that we're European champions, I mean it took a while to sink in. You are in Europe, where obviously not very many Jamaicans. I wish that there was a couple more Jamaicans there to celebrate with us. But it meant a lot. I mean, Jamaica was just right after the Hurricane Melissa.
