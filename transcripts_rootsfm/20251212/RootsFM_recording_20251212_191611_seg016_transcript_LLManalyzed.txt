20251212 191611 I do not like to sing unless it's glass of style and fashion. Coming purpose in the area is to nice up this reception. The lyrics of my mom must always have a word of caution. Loving is a thing we can't get too much, too much. Does anything we sing, we say, is I originated. But why we say my gum, we say how they might imitate it. Because they might come and tell me Hugo said we wrecked you. And Friday in the gum, we say they really want to tell me too much.
