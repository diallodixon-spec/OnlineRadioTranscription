20251223 114830 Just bring all your troubles to the Father A broken prayer is still a prayer We know the Lord will be right there when we cry A fragile praise is still a praise It will be heard when it is raised to the sky We don't need words of eloquence when we talk to Him Cause the Savior is concerned with every kid He hears a broken prayer There is a place that's always safe A refuge from the rain Where you'll be covered with his love
