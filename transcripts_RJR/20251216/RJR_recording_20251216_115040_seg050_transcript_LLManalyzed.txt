20251216 115040 Can you please turn up here at Don's Motor World? You might not need to come with your own transport. I don't think that's going to be provided for you. So get one air bridge and then come and take a look here. Don't be like the man with the pickup that's in front of me, who figures out all of the board and things are still up on the top by themselves. But it's a science. I'm at them stage. It's not going to happen. You have you have to tie it down real tie don't put this red liquid on it I'm sorry all right but I don't know how you drive off a vehicle without the thing they tie off and everything fall off a ground but anyway and put it down like a cutter no the vehicle don't have cutter but as human beings have cut. All right. Let me take a call. Good morning. How are you? Hello? Hello? Yes, sir. Good morning. Dr. T, how you do? How you do? I'm not giving thanks, man. I'm giving thanks. This is never.
