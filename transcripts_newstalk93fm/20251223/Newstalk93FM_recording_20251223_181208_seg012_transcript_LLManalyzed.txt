20251223 181208 Let me down again Cause I depended on you So you better come through this time Please hear my cry and if I ever Let you down my friend It was a misunderstanding So if I took it for granted Then I promise from today I'll go jump like I never jump Waved like I never waved Pined like I never won before Just to show you I'm sorry, I'm sorry And I need you back in my life You got people by the truck Emotions running high We are not in the sky Tears running down we eye Can't you tell that we sorry, we sorry And we need you home to me. I, I need time, no place to go. Come to me, come to me.
