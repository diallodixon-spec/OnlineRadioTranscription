20251219 134127 there's also a couple of schools that are close to where we do business, right? We take care of the people around us. So we're starting with two schools, one in Montego Bay, Catherine Hall. I don't know if you've been to Catherine Hall, but the place has been truly, truly devastated. But they're such resilient people and they're trying to pull back. You know, we visited the school and we see that they are cleaning up. The parents are helping the teachers who have lost, some of them lost everything, are coming out and also helping to clean up. So the Catherine Hall Primary and Infant School in Catherine Hall, St. James and the Nazareth Primary Infant School up in Maidstone. I know everybody here about Maidstone. Yes, it's a very, a community rich, very rich history, one of the first free villages in Jamaica. So we need to preserve that kind of history and we want the children there to be able to go back to learning and to get back into a classroom setting where they can be comfortable and we can get them, you know, back on track as early as possible.
