He's in a yellow cap and yellow sleeves. I can see the sleeves, I can see the rest of the silks. Number 11 giving trouble. Bubbling up and down in the gate. 12 sits quietly. Nine is a late scratch. So we just have about two horses left. Numbers ten and three to go in, so now is a good time to take it over. Listen for noble sovereign.
