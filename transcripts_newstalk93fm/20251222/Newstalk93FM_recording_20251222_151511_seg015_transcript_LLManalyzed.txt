20251222 151511 Come and meet me in the truck and we rev it up Whole day, keep throwing it back at the way you stop Baby, no way, we could post up all the pictures you want When you're ready, I go over here Lali, you go over there But we compete in the middle and start a bacchanal Play in the middle, hey, what we gonna do now Jam to a rhythm in the heat, I can't evil, I want your company and it's nothing too risky, limited liability Don't worry if you try all the things I like You could still be shy in the morning So don't feel away You don't like the fast life When you come on the bright side
