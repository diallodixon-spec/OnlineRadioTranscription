20251224 161409 Where you are I listen to your call The trials come my way Don't ever go astray Leave me alone You are my rock, my shield, my fortress You are my hiding place You lift me up when I am down You never let me stray So I call on You my Savior Hear my prayer today Where your presence lead me Lord I will go Lead me where you go I answer to your call The driest of me
