20260101 185629 Take some money to my sister. I don't ever it home tonight Take some money to my sister I don't ever wanna chase after niggas Cause where I'm from, niggas out here dying every day And they ain't no pair, they just trying to make a way And I ain't no different, so if I can't hit me soon These are my last wishes, I hope you keep them in mind girl, if I don't make it home tonight
