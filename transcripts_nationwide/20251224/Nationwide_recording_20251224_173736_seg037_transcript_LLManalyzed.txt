I'm doing alright. Happy Christmas to you. And happy Christmas to you too and to all our listeners and YouTubers and everyone. We are right on the edge of it. Good. Good. Yes. So, as the year 2025 draws to a close, we're reviewing the work done in several ministries. This afternoon, we're turning to the Ministry of Industry, Investment, and Commerce.
