inspiration, practice, cheerful, harmony, always. Turn up the radio! Free up, free up my people, free up on yourself Just love and care and share some of the wealth, yeah Free up free up my people free up on yourself No bother rob or steal nor kill nobody Get your youths a own food, say them a fee improve You sit them on the turf, you say them a ain't truth Make sure them get a work and do not accuse Or else you'll find yourself on the six o'clock news. Youths, going to school, they need clothes and shoes, textbook and rules to build their IQs. Things not run smooth, well, them a go get through. Just give them it fast, they may wanna excuse ya. Free up, free up, my people, free up on yourselves.
