20251231 212718 We march to the drumbeat of God Almighty If all the others just wander around I'm a member of the Holy Ghost Traveling Man We're moving on up to a better land We hear the voice of the supernatural Saying that my Holy Ghost will go again We listen to the trumpet of Jesus While the world hears a different sound We march to the drum beat of God Almighty While the others just wander around And we world seems indifferent to you His melody of love calls you
