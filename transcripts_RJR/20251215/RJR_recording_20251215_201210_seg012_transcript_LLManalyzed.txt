20251215 201210 I'm a liar, yeah I'm a liar Mind One in the back, hope no rain But here I am, just tell you thanks Ask me how, I don't know, I ain't no pro But I'm a liar Yeah, I'm alive I challenge the day with an open mind Just in a way that I would design Know I will falter, but in time I will grow, I will grow Can't be too old to be taught Can't even learn something from the youth live a little not if you know the truth
