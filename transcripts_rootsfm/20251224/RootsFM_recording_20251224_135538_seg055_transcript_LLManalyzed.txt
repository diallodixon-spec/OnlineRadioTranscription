20251224 135538 So tall Remembering how you kiss me. Oh, baby The gifts are under the tree, but I know There's nothing there that I need I'm making a wish on stars above So I can be with the one I love Cause it don't feel like Christmas time without you It's no place of hope, I'm falling down And my heart beats but there's no sound Cause it don't feels like Christmas without you I pray the angels watch over you
