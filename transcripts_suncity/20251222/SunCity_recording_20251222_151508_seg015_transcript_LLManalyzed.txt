20251222 151508 I put on my clothes Cause I got bills to pay Now it ain't easy But I don't need nothing I've got a strong will to survive I've got a deeper love A a deeper love A deeper love inside And I call it pride, a deeper love, pride A deeper love, pride a deeper love It's the power that gives you the strength to survive Pride, a deeper love Good afternoon, good evening, and good night to all my listeners all over the world.
