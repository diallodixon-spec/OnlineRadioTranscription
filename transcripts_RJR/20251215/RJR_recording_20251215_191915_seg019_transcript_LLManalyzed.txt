20251215 191915 I have Michael Diamond of the Consumers' Intervention of Jamaica saying businesses are subject to indirect shocks. A Cat 5 hurricane is such all hands on deck for Jamaica's recovery. The entertainment sector is mostly informal, doesn't pay their fair share of taxes anyway. These events do require government resources such as JCF. Remember they pay extra to for the police. They have to pay for that enough free. They must be at time for a reset. Let's not act as if nothing happened just because Kingston roofs are still intact. Jamaicans party 24-7 while the country is struggling. Now we have a national emergency. Individuals are still seeking to dance while our brothers and sisters are in danger. We must do better. Kudos to the government. I have, let me see, I had a list. Now I'm trying to find it. Somebody had been concerned.
