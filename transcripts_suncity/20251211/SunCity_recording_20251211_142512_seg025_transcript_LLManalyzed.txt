============================================================

Tryin' to stress out just how things got this way I thought that we were in love But I swear by now I don't know what you want me I make sure that I give you quality time But lately I feel you're not owned by design But still I'm gonna try to give you the love of my life In hopes that you, that you will open up your heart. Girl, I care about you. Yeah. I'm there for you. Can I get a witness right now? So why don't you care for me? Yeah, yeah. I care about you, baby.
