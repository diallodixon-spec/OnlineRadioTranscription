20260101 095242 Kiss the heart, forget the world I do now With all this time One more kiss Even though it's come to this I'll close my eyes and make a wish Hoping you'll remember all this time All in all I know regrets The sun still shines, the sun still sets And the heart won't give, the heart won't guess
