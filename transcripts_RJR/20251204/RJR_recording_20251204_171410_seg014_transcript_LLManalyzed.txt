jamaica and now it's all from here. Michael Bennett have been gathering donat after the country was dev Melissa. But when they ca to load a 20 ft truck thi was gone for someone to sa security by the company public storage in Mississauga. He says it shows a flat truck break through a locked gate back up to this blue trailer where the barrels and crates of goods were stored. The truck was loaded up before driving away, all around 5 in the morning. It doesn't matter about the stuff and all that thing. The food is more important than even some of the other stuff that's there. You know what I mean? What are they going to do with it here? Absolutely nothing, man. Absolutely nothing. Among the stolen items were nearly two dozen barrels and crates.
