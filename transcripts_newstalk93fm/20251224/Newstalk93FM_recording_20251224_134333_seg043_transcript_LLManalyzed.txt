When you come the bright side, I go take the blame. I just want you to rise it up Just a little whine there now Come and meet me behind the truck and we rev it up Say hold it, keep throwing it back at the way you stopped us Baby no way, we could boast of all the pictures you want When you're ready, I could overshare Darling, you to go over here What we could eat in the middle and start a bacchanal Play in the middle, hey, what we gon' do now? Jam to a rhythm, yeah Heat a carnival, go get the heat, hey What we gon' do know? Start a wine on it, a slick compromise on it
