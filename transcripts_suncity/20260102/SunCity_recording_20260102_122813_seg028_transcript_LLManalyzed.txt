20260102 122813 We've made a start So let's never fall Prepare a place in your heart That's where it all starts A place in your heart Make love very sad, then, baby Prepare a place in your heart Let me take you to the fall, move around a bat Wedding bells in my ears, you in my tart I keep every secret, your victory or loss You see every mistake, you see every flaw Still, I love you the same way, love you to the last
