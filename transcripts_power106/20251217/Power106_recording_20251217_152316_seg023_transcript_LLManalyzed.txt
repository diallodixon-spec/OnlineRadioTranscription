20251217 152316 I have some rich people over 200 years. They have one thing where they use to extract the rind from the sour orange to use as fuel for airplane and lamp. It look like a broad plate with a little ditch in it like and underneath is like with a funnel shape and they all make out of copper. So sharp copper nail coming out of it.

If you grow a country now you'll notice when you peel an orange and bend the skin and squeeze it on the fire,
