20260101 193024 I can't survive on my own If a girl walks in and calls her name in my heart I'll turn and run away Every day we're vowing let us stray It's hard to be lucky in love It gets in your eyes, it's making you cry Don't know what to do, don't know to do You're looking for love Calling heaven above Send me an angel Send me an angel Right now Right now Send me an angel Send me an angel Right now Right now
