This deficit comes marginally below the trade deficit of 5.59 billion recorded in 2023 when the country imported 7.59 billion in merchandise goods and exported only 2 billion in merchandise goods. A deficit of 5.83 billion was the first 7 months of this year on a 3.8% spike in imports to $4.52 billion on a 2.9% dip in exports to $1.06 billion. This compares to a deficit of $3.26 billion for the first seven months of last year. Net remittances between inflows and outflows were around at $3.12 billion last year while net flows from the tourism sector were around at $1.76 billion. This means that the net flows of 4.88 billion, goblin from the tourism sector and remittances last year could not cover trade deficit of 5.42 billion wrapped up last year. We'll now take a break for the time signal. When we come back we'll be focusing on net international reserves.
