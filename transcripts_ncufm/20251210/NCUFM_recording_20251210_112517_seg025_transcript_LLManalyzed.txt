Another year, all these blessings coming from Maxine Anderson. Special birthday to Leighton White, John Mark Blackwood and Carl Hedlum, all of Sherwood SDA Church. They're celebrating their birthday today, December 10th. Greetings from the Family Life Department. Nuff Nuff Blessings. Shout out to Horace and Elder Tracy and Forbes of the Whittorne Estee Church. They're celebrating 28 years of togetherness. I wish for them God's richest blessings.
