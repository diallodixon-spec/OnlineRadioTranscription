20251226 135846 I want to be in your life until the night is over. I want to hold you so tight, so tight, coming closer. It's been a hell of a ride, but single moment You were there by my side Whenever I'm broken You make me feel whole Whenever I'm lonely You're there for my soul Wherever you are, girl That's why I call my own Whenever you doubt it, I'll be letting you know I want to be dancing with you forever You see through the storm and take me as I am Baby, it's magic anytime that we're together
