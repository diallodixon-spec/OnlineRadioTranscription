20251223 133918 Thank you very much, my brother. We have to go though here. God bless. All right. Smithy, how you doing? Hey, Dr. Gale. Bless up yourself, my brother. Good afternoon, man. Merry Christmas to you and the whole entire Jamaican land below. Yes, man. Dr. Gale, if that statistic, what you have just said about the average American and the average Jamaican is any way true, any true to that, well, the credit would be for the Democratic Party. No, hold on. I'm making sure you get this right. The median income per capita for the United States is $37,000. Forget about the $54,000 they're talking about. That is a joke. Ours is less than $7,000.
