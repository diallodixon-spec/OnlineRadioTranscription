20251223 194225 So it's two things. One, you are diabolical. And second, do you need a sidekick? A joke still, but people for real, some of you need to take it easy on the prices for the produce and stuff because they are leaning towards outrageous. You know, strangely, I have a different take on things. I just figure that this Christmas, I'm going to see a lot of creative cooking like it's sponsored by Grace. You see, I figure that the prices for certain things seem too high. People will find cheaper alternatives and create different dishes. That should be fun. I guess, I mean. All right, people, onto my favorite beaten stick topic, road safety. People, listen to me a lock in, please. We are staring down the barrel of a long holiday weekend. Whole heap of trips, the family home party, all sort of link up vibes and everything. I'm just kindly asking you to take the time on the road now please. Take the time on the Road. The best way to have a Merry Christmas
