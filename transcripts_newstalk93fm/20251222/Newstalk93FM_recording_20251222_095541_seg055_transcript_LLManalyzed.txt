20251222 095541 What I play for my belly, you giving me energy I don't need to lose my composure, cause me losing control Giving me more than I need, everything where you got it for party Even if what I got in me pepe, don't fit to device you my old reggae My ready my blues, my activity all the thing from Monday to Sunday Say you be my gold, nobody do me like you do. My music and my muse, everything my baby, my rhythm and blues. So many things you did, do nobody. Nothing carry, you play happy to lose. Carrying my love, put it all on you. And I get the money, money for two. Over my retina, where you come through.
