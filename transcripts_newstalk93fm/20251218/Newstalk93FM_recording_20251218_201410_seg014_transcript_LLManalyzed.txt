20251218 201410 We could post up all the pictures you want when you're ready. I go over here, darling. You go over there. But we could meet in the middle and start a bacchanal. Play in the middle, hey. What we gonna do now? Jam to a rhythm in the heat. I can't eval, but in the heat, hey, what we gonna do now. Start a wine on it. I say, compromise on it. Baby, spend time on it. Hey, I say, compromise I say compromise on me Can we talk some business? You know I want your company And it's nothing too risky Limited liability Don't worry If you try all the things I like You could still be shy in the morning So don't feel away You don't like the fast life But look on the bright side, girl I go take the blame I just want you to come and rise it up Just a little whining
