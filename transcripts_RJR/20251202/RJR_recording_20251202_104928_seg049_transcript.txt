Thank you so much, Daryon. Daryon Reid, of course, is Communications Officer at the JPS, giving us an update that we did get some communities, we did get some parishes, not just percentages, all right? And of course, you know, it's a difficult task, but of course, you have to stay doggedly at it, because this is a community without power, and we need to get the country up and running. And let's face it, five weeks out, well, nothing too bad if I'm safe for myself. Thank you so much, Daryon. You're welcome, sir. Have a great day. All the best. All right, bye-bye. And that was JPS Cares, and you know, valuable information being shared there. And of course, we always remember those who are toiling while they too have suffered damage. Sometimes we kind of forget that their personal they who themselves need help what they are on the job and doing whatever they can so happy about that let's see let me remind other numbers hopefully get those lines sorted out eight seven
