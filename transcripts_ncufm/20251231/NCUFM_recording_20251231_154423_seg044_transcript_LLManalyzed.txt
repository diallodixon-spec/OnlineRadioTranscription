20251231 154423 don't have to pay my way to see Jesus because he's right here by my side all my face is reserved for me the cost of my crown is free all I have to do is say yes. Jesus has done the rest. Imagine walking on those streets of gold. Side by side with angels, time will be no more. I can't wait to see his new scarred hands. And then I humbly bow just to say thanks. Thank you, love. Don't have to beg to my mass. Oh.
