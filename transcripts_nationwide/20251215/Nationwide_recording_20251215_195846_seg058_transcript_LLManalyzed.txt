And what what I also noticed that I was in Port Maria on Saturday and I noticed the number of policemen and women on foot patrol. Mm hmm. Yeah. Yes, I saw them today in Crossroads. Similarly, in well, not Ochi but Port Maria and I was wondering what is happening that it dawned on me is Christmas. Mm hmm. Yeah. I welcome them but I'm talking about people in private cars now with these sirens and lights and it's not looking good to me because they're pushing you out of the road and I don't say as I say I know it's when they have government ministers that they're escorting but these are by themselves and I'm seeing it more than one more than twice or three little time you see me for you. Alright. It needs to be first done. Hear you Petal. We're out of time. Very well. Appreciate the call though. Thank you Petal. Alright.
