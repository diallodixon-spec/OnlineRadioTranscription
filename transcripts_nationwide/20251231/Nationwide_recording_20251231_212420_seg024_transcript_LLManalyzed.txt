20251231 212420 I want to create another version with you It's time to press up against you like a tune Big 45 So listen to Kareem Open with no warning I love you like stone love till the early morning Rockers down the orange streets are roots wrapped me darling Put me on your big rhythm make we start recording I used to be on your base and now I'm dead on your mic Now we reach a stage where we perform for life You keep releasing and I'll keep receiving the house step on
