20251223 100905 Where is that? Where is that kind of Christmas feel? Where you see the children enjoying themselves? We are no longer a traditional country as it relates to what we would normally do coming up to Christmas or on Christmas Day. I don't like that. I can recall like now my mommy would take out the prettiest sheets and the most beautiful curtains and you couldn't sit on the bed, you know, you just have to leave that there for people to come and sit within the suite, that nice sheet that goes on on the bed only once per year. One little seat in a couple days, and then it's taken off and put in a bag over the top of the closet. That's right, that's right. And then now, if you had the figurines, those crackly, those little stuff in there, you have to be very careful with those, you know, because you're going to to clean them you're going to wash them off you know everything now they put in a pan in a pan and you wash them off but we have some that wasn't they were made out of chalk like you know yeah man no no no you have to wipe it off because of problems yes yes and don't make your mother see no crack on it
