But do you believe that people fear being alone and then sometimes they settle for people partners that you know and that they don't get respect from or the partner doesn't value them or generally care about them, but because they want to be with someone they they they tend to them just push out on their carpet. I have a lot of females to them in a whole leap of abusive relationship money treat them all kind of thing. But because they're so desperate and then they're not lonely. Then just put up with it. Yes. So as I said, there's pros and cons to it. Boy, so love should not be driven by fear as well. So you know, there are people that, you know, desire for love and but it's a lot of it is rooted in fear, fear of loneliness, fear of rejection, fear of not being enough or even often leads to unhealthy relationship.
