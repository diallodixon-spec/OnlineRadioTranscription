20251224 122615 I don't want a lot for Christmas There is just one thing I need And I don't care about the presents I only need the Christmas tree I don't need to end my stocking Live upon the fireplace Santa Claus won't make me happy With a toy on Christmas day I just want you for mine Oh Oh, I won't ask for much this Christmas I won't even wish for snow And I'm just gonna keep on waiting All I need is a mistletoe
