20251215 200104 You're listening to sleek radio 93 FM. I feel your frequency from miles away You come alive with one wine, baby With you I want to dance the night away One jam's on a lifetime, baby So don't feel away You don't like the fast life I look look on the bright side, I go take the blame I just want you to come and light it up, just a little winding up Come and meet me in the truck and we rev it up All day, keep throwing it back at the way you like it
