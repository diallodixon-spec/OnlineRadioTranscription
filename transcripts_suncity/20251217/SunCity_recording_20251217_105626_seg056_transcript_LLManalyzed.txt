20251217 105626 We've been down in this valley for a very long time Don't you know Jah is always on time And every morning the sun still shines To my brothers don't you be unkind We the scripture chase the devil away Oh Jah people don't forget to pray And as you're moving on through your day. Oh, give thanks in every way. Don't worry. My people, don't you ever forget. Give God the glory.
