20251223 194433 You look at me and I begin to melt Just like the snow when the ray of sun is. And I know that you're an angel in the sky. Don't take my easy. Do you believe you're what's up? Do you believe you what's up? But you're not rough like me. You're not rough, like me. Cause anytime I come, I come dangerous. And anytime I come, we come cantongerous. Ministers on the top, we ain't no tremors. Yes, cause the melody, we don't answers. No way.
