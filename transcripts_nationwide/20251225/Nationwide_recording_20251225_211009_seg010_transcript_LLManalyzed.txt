20251225 211009 I don't need this, I'm not a good taste I'm trying to be all fresh and I speak with all of my face Me, I, I, I'm walking in the blue Me, I, us, me, I, us And they all sound the same old track Sometimes people think it's cool But it's not gonna work, it's a burger stand I'm a happy, happy man Cause they all love me Slammy, no, somebody slap me Cause I know I'm looking good, attitude out of the room People are staring at me, yeah, this could be too good for me
