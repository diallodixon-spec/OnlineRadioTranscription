20251216 115435 Gracious and we're so sorry Lord for the times that we have wronged you We've hurt others and in so hurt you We have ignored your commandments and done our own thing following tradition over scripture We're so sorry for the times when we have intentionally done our own thing Done that thing we know is wrong. We sinnedned intentionally we thought about it before we did it and we did it and sometimes we didn't even feel bad about it right now I'm asking that you will forgive us father and that you will cleanse us from all unrighteousness we are coming to you now confessing our sins because the word says that if we confess our sins you're faithful and just to forgive us and to cleanse us So I'm asking that as you forgive us that you will cleanse us from sin because father time is wrapping up So many things are happening around the world in America in the UK across the world
