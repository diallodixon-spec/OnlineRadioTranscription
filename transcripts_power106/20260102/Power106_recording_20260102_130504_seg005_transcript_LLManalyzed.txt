20260102 130504 No, just for one, just for, again, I'm not saying stuff, right, a year or seven, and I kind of conquer what you're saying too, but that's what's my opinion on that, okay? All right, yeah. One thing, one quick thing, two other things. What Kritik was talking about with the cameras, he wasn't, I think he wasn't talking about cameras that monitor a screen or monitor an interstitial or whatever. He was talking about the camera that literally, it sends, or it knows you're going at a certain speed, it takes a picture of the license plate, and it sends an internet ticket in the mail, sending it in the mail where you register or your email. It doesn't go on your license of course, you don't know who's driving the car but what it does is it goes against the car. So if you don't pay in New York, if you don't that ticket or you get three of them or whatever, you don't pay them, they'll come and boot you.
