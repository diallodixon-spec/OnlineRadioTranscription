hearing right now, would you say? Could you repeat that? I was saying that, you know, the song pushes you outside your comfort zone as a singer. What new side of Jodie and Pantry are fans hearing, would you say, right now? The side that is no longer living inside her head, the side that is not really thinking about what people are thinking about her in terms of her faith in Christ, her Christian life and stuff like that. I do not believe God gifted me with such a voice. God gifted me with a gift for me to just squeeze, just squeeze to press myself, you know, and what they're hearing now is how I'm feeling within, deep within. Happy, carefree, joyous, upbeat, no sadness thrown here, where sadness will go, where depression will go, you know?
