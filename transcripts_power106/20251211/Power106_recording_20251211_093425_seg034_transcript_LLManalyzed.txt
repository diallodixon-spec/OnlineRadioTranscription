45 a.m. segment of the show. In its certain government policies we don't have to be very obtuse to believe we cannot rehabilitate an energy intensive economy by restoring the electricity grid quickly and is therefore against this background that we support the move by the government to make the front load the 150 million US dollar loan to JPSCO and to keep our 170 linemen who are currently here and bring in another 300 during the Christmas season to fast track the rehabilitation process. The big question is however, will this amount be enough to fully restore the power to the country and if not, where would the rest of the money come from if JPSCo's license is not extended for between 8 and 10 years? We will tell you why this is a key question in the 10am segment of the show.
