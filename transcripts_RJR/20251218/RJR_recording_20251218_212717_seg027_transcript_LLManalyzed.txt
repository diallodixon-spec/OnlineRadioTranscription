20251218 212717 Oh, someday at Christmas there'll be no tears When all men are equal and no man has missed One shiny mole but one proud way from our world today Someday all our dreams will come to be Someday the world will meet our greed But some Nightmare. Hates must be gone, and love will prevail. Some day a new world that we can start with hope in every heart. Yeah. Oh, yeah.
