20260101 182211 It's not your fault That you were born with such a trusting heart You raised that thought You're so beautiful these days And no one understands how much it hurts You tried to make it work, you lied You gave it all you got Don't cry, it's over now Don't sigh, things are better now I will give you everything you need You can always count on me, oh yeah
