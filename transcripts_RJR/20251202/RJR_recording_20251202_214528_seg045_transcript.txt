Okay. Well, what about this matter of crime being a living organism? So if you have policies and you execute them in a certain way, sometimes there's a geographical shift in the criminal elements to somewhere else which is not so hot or they shift from one type of crime to another type of crime. So I want to know what is the approach from the ministry to deal with that shifting nature of crime because of this principle of trying to survive when the pressures of law enforcement and the policies are focused on the criminals. So that question is put to you, Mr. Hawes.
