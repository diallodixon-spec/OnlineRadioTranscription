20251223 124832 oil remains stranded at sea amid heightened enforcement and uncertainty over future shipments. On the international scene, a suspected cyber attack has disrupted operations at France's National Postal Service and its banking arm, causing delays and frustration during the busy Christmas season. France's postal service, La Poste, says a distributed denial of service attack made several of its online platforms inaccessible yesterday. While the company has stressed that there is no indication customer data was compromised, the outage affected mail and package deliveries at one of the most crucial times of the year. At post offices in Paris and other parts of the country, customers were turned away as systems went offline. Many were unable to send or collect parcels, including Christmas gifts, and struggled to operate without access to digital services.
