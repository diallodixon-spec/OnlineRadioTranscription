20251230 134827 of underground Christians are in China. Yes, oppressed, persecuted, imprisoned, but not cast down. We in the Western world, in the Caribbean, in North America, we don't know what persecution is all about. We really haven't experienced that yet, but it is coming. Make sure your relationship with Christ is so strong that when it does come, you will not become so discouraged that you give up your faith. As a matter of fact, it should push us closer to Jesus Christ. He is our only source of refuge and protection in this world of darkness. We will see tomorrow. That was your Sabbath school nugget with Pastor Robert Wright. This is NCU 91.1.
