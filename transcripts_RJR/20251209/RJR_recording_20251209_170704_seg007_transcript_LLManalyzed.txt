Bailey was handed over to the Linstead police, who subsequently charged him. The Manchester police are probing the circumstances, which led to the tragic death of nine-year-old student of Vennerode Primary and Junior High School in Mandeville this morning. Amoya Moore died after she was ran over by a garbage truck while on her way to school. The incident happened about 6.50. The driver has been taken into custody. Head of the Public Safety and Traffic Enforcement Branch, Assistant Commissioner Dr. Gary McKenzie told Radio Jamaica News that the garbage truck was exiting Bonito Heights onto Bonito Crescent when it struck a mower who was standing at the intersection. The grade four student was dragged several feet and died at the scene. What we gleaned is that the truck was traveling along the roadway when somehow contact was made with the child. Unfortunately, the child fell under the motor truck and was run over and suffered serious injuries and died.
