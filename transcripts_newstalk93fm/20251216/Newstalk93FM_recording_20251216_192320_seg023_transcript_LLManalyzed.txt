20251216 192320 These roads of flames are catching a fire I told you I loved you, you called me a liar Baby, tell me where you've gone, gone, gone I've been feeling for your love so long. We can grace each other in the moonlight. Baby, if you would be better tonight. And I've been gone too long. And I'm hoping that you'll sing my song. I've been hoping that we all get along These roads and things are catching a fire I showed you I love you, you called me a liar Can't stop the things that stand in my way
