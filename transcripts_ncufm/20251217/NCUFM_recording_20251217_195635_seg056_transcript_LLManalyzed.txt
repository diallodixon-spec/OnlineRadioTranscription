20251217 195635 Billy, why are you dressed up like an ant? Because there are ants in the driveway, and I need to tell them that they need to move before dad became a baby and grew up and told us that he loves us and that we need him. When did he do that? At Christmas time. Oh, yeah. So I'm going to become an aunt and tell them that they have to move before dad comes home. Can I help? Yeah, you go get dad's headphones, and we're close since spring's on for antennas. OK.
