20251222 210908 It's like a type of alchemy. Introduce me to your best friend. I can come and slot right in. A satellite ain't even that far. I kind of wonder where you are. And you know I can't leave it alone. You're all mine. I already gave you the time and the place, so don't be shy. Just come be the man I need. Tell me you got something to give. I want it. I kind of like it when you call.
