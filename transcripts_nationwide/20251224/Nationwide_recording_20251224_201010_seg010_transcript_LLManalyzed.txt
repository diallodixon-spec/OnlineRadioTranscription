I learned working with the negatives to make for better pictures I learned Hennessy and enemies is one hell of a mixture Even though it's girl, I'm still bitchin' damn Is it the fall? It's time for me to revisit the past Since women have called us, I used to drive this liquor involved It's stories to tell, we've been through it all Interviews are like confessions My dressing room confusing me with questions like Do you love it? Are you right now? Do you ever get nervous? Are you single? I heard girl, is it true? You getting money? DJ Khaled! I'm getting so cold I ain't went this hard since I was 18 Apologize if I say Anything I don't mean Like what's up with your best friend? We could all have some fun, believe me
