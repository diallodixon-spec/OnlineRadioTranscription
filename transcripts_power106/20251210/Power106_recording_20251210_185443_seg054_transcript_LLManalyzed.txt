What is the level of female participation now? We have maybe about three females in our program that are up to the level where they want to compete. They'd like to compete, but because of the lack of female involvement in the sport in Jamaica, it's posing a difficult task to find somebody who is ready enough to participate. So in the coming year, we are planning on seeing how best we can explore other options to have our female members get a chance to explore a little bit more on what they have learned and how they have been developing. Since this year, we had one female compete in a boxing match outside of Jamaica.
