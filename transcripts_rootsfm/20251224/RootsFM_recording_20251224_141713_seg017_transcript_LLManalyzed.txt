20251224 141713 You won't take this holiday Always putting me in the clouds Stormy weather all around And I always hold you down When I know that I can do better Holidays are supposed to bring us closer but now I realize with me and you there's no hope I lost my love on Christmas night a gift that hurts at the same time about to be a new year, a new state of mind But it's like hell right now Cause you're not around, no Christmas night You would think after all these years
