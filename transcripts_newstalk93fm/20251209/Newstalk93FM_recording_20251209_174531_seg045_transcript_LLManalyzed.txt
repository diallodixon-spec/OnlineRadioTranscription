fine but i can't be the noise in my mind wouldn't leave me i tried to get by but i'm burning and behind my mind it runs all these thoughts of traveling fighting to give up my pain fighting to be on my lane my mind running to the other side when it's time to leave my life then it tries to take me out Tell you what I need, riot I really need I really need time now I really need I need a free mind now this is the piece that you cannot buy send me love that you cannot mix one is the joy that you cannot waste and the other one price that you cannot fix this is the peace that you cannot buy
