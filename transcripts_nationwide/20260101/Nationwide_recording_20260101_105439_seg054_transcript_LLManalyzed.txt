20260101 105439 Every night I rush to my bed With hopes that maybe I'll get a chance To see you when I close my eyes I'm going out of my head Lost in the fairytale Can you hold my hands and be my guide? When I'm filled with stars, travel your skies And I hope it rains, you're the perfect lullaby What kind as you're here, I'll be floatin' on air
