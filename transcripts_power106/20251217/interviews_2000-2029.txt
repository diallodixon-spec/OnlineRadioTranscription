**Interview with Miss Carole Jones: The Power of Gratitude in Building Resilience**

In a recent episode of "Powering Your Health" on Power 106 FM, host Dr. Jacqueline Campbell sat down with Miss Carole Jones, a civil servant and praise and worship leader at Kencott Christian Fellowship, to discuss the importance of gratitude in building resilience. The conversation was inspired by the devastating effects of Hurricane Melissa, which highlighted the need for individuals to focus on the positive aspects of their lives, even in the face of adversity.

According to Miss Jones, gratitude is about being thankful for everything that happens in life, whether good or bad. She emphasized that it's essential to acknowledge the difficulties, but also to look beyond them and find something to be thankful for. "If we stay focused on the hard things, the difficult things, the things that make us upset, angry, mad, then we're constantly going to be in a state of upset, anger, and end up in depression," she said.

Miss Jones shared her personal experience of coping with the aftermath of Hurricane Melissa, where she focused on the acts of kindness and generosity that emerged in the community, rather than dwelling on the devastation. "It helps us now to have hope, knowing and looking at this side of it, rather than focusing on the side that just looks at devastation," she explained.

The conversation also touched on the importance of practicing gratitude on a daily basis, especially in the face of adverse life situations such as toxic relationships, financial challenges, illness, and death of a loved one. Miss Jones suggested that individuals can cultivate gratitude by focusing on small things that bring joy, such as a beautiful sunrise, a kind word from a stranger, or a good meal. She also recommended keeping a gratitude diary, where individuals can write down three to five things they are grateful for each day.

As a Christian, Miss Jones emphasized the importance of prayer and thanksgiving in cultivating gratitude. She quoted Philippians 4:6, which says, "Be anxious for nothing, but in everything, by prayer and supplication, with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God." She also encouraged individuals to share their struggles with others, whether it's a friend, colleague, or counselor, as a way of offloading the burden and finding hope.

The interview concluded with Miss Jones emphasizing the importance of gratitude in building resilience and finding joy, even in the midst of challenges. "Gratitude is not just about being thankful for the big things, but also for the small things that make life worth living," she said. By cultivating gratitude, individuals can develop a more positive outlook, build stronger relationships, and find peace and hope in the midst of adversity.
