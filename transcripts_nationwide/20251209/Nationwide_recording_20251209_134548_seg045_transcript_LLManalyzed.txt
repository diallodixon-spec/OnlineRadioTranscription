I'm on a rush them like a pit bull Mix with a rap tip, drop them like a Mix with a f**k, I know f**k them Love to watch you watch you chatty chatty like a Pee Pee Pinch and mix with the mode of my seat Try no mix up the original, recovered coffee Don't mix the marijuana plant with the poppies And no rent a jet, no free and mix up with no nothing No fashion dread, nothing come a talk bout to lassie. Me love me girl dem caramel, a little coffee. She rent me, but she know when she be classy. Talking bout a slim girl, mixed with a party, me a talk bout smiley Them say me look so cute under the ear, seen on the bench with the calabas laugh World young girl run come to the tree
