Miss Nelson, what was the experience like for you here today? It was fabulous. I must congratulate the Paw 106 FM team. They have really, really organized a fantastic pre-Christmas event here. And I am sure, particularly, I want to say a big shout out to the the folks over by JUTC they were part of the early purchasers here this morning they came out in their number so I want to say Merry Christmas to the JUTC team and I also want to say merry Christmas to the Power 106 team. I mean, this was really a fantastic event and all our partners here, we are really, really appreciative of you coming out to support us. You're proud, you're proud, Ms. Drop a girl.
