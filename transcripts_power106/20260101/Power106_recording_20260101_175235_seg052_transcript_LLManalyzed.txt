20260101 175235 Take my love, I'll never ask for too much Just all that you are and everything that you do I don't really need to look very much further I don't wanna have to go Where you don't follow I won't hold it back again There's passion inside Can't run from myself There's nowhere to hide Don't make me close one more door. I don't want a heart anymore. Stay in my arms if you dare. Must I imagine you there? Don't walk away from me.
