We talk it, we talk, we talk about, we talk about me watching the house themselves and me can't do nothing about it, I have to f**k it up. Two houses for the 56 million dollars and them and them have two more of the cycle them for another 56 million dollars. $56,000,000. Right now I'm not used to it. My hands here, my two hands have no use. If you hold the phone up, I'm going to put the entire shirt on my neck and put the phone on it. And that's how I operate. My two foot have no use. My back has cramps, what do you call it? I have prostate cancer.
