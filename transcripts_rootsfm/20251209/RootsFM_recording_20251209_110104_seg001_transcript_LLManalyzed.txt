Hi, Sister Milla. It's now time for a rebroadcast of At the Bar with Attorney-at-Law, Venise Brown. She was speaking with the Commissioner of Indicum, Hugh Faulkner, who she spoke to earlier last week at the Indicum headquarters. It's now over to a rebroadcast with Venise. Good morning and welcome to all our listeners. This is At the Bar. We're here today with Mr. Hugh Faulkner. He's the Commissioner of Indicum. Welcome Mr. Faulkner. Thank you for joining us. Thank you, Ms. Brown. It's my pleasure to be part of this program and I greet your listeners also. Thank you. Now we just have a few questions that we'd like to ask you about Indicum because Indicum is a very important organization in Jamaica. So can you tell us what the role of Indicum is? Right, so we extract our role.
