Girl, them wine got the feeling, sweet like honeycomb. Oh, yeah. Girl, them backing up that thing there. Nothing at the place, well at the summit there. Girl, tip it up on your toe and catch, balance it. So, my girl, you got the wine for the season. Back it up with the wine for this season. Sexy gal, when you bubble up your race and you're mashing up the place with the wine for this season, all right? Bubble up your race so you're thicker, so you talk. Girl, me love the move when you're getting at it. A cutter than them, number one up on the top. Wine for the season and show me where you're going. Girl, I come, girl.
