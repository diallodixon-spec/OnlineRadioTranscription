2025-12-12 12:11:58 you're not going to always have that you know so doing the most now just our moment to get two little bag and open online is not enough how do we convince our young people that listen understand that think about your future think about who you are and then you make a decision if that's how you want to navigate in the social media space that's an excellent question for me i always and i guess maybe maybe not everyone will share my approach to life but i'll share it anyways i always guide my steps or my actions back to the word of god the word of god declares me that i'm a royal priesthood right i'm a holy nation. But guess what? I always look at it to say this. If I am royalty, have I ever seen royalty, like the real dignified royals acting in a manner which is outside of the royalty?
