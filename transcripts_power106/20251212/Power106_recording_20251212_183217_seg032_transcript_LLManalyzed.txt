20251212 183217 history. Late Jamaican and Westernist cricketer Laurie Williams was born on December 12, 1968. He made his first-class debut in 4th Jamaica in February 1990 against England, opening the bowling. A skillful medium-paced bowler, he relied on seam and swing rather than sheer speed, and was known for his control and consistency. He was also a useful lower-order batter, scoring three first-class centuries, including a career best, 135 for Jamaica against the Wingman Islands. At the international level, William represented the West Indies in 15 one-day internationals, most of them during the 2000-2001 Carlton Series in Australia. One of his standout performances came early in his ODI career, when he claimed three wickets for the 16 runs against New Zealand. By the time of his untimely death in a car accident in 2002 at age 33, Lauren Williams had played 58 first-class matches for Jamaica and West Indies A.
