In Romania, as well as Uzbekistan, they're celebrating Constitution Day, celebrating the establishment of their constitutions. In Romania and Uzbekistan, in Syria it's Liberation Day. A public holiday in Syria celebrated on this day annually to mark the fall of the Ba'athist regime and the end of the Assad family's rule which began in 1971. And of course this holiday was established just this year in October following a decree by Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharah.
