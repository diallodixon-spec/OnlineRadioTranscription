============================================================

I got flowers in my room, but they were not from you So I set them on fire, got them miraculous That you're running near before I got all chucked up Here comes my high nights, it's shining, I'ma show me a girlie who's a girl A kiss, no really, I need you a bit to heal me me, I'm swimming, watch 30 millimetres No fear in me, when you say we shoot back up I'm so surprised You play with my mind And I owe you guys Maybe we'll die tonight Is this a compromise?
