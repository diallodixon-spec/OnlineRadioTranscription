20251218 200908 planning you know and yesterday um i was having i was having a little link up with some friends you know and all aka we did their bar and somebody told him said i mentioned some man because we're talking about father's day everything about some man who had quite a few kids and man like but that don't make sense you know and he's like no he can afford them. And based on who he said it was, yeah, some money did that. So he probably could, but I said, that still don't make sense because there is no way he could adequately, even with planning, spend enough time with all of them amount of interest over, over him. And that is part of it also. So when you said 10, you know know it's not even just about they afford it because you'll be able to afford it but can you afford it time wise right you know and it's not okay so yeah time wise in time to spend time with you pick me and all them things there yeah I had a similar conversation on the on the weekend
