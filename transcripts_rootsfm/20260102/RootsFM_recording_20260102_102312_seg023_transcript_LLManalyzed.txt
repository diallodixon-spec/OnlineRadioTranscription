20260102 102312 It's a beautiful day, it's a beautiful day So yeah, though I walk through the valleys of the shadows of death I will fear no evil, won't be dismay When I see the clock ticking away And the things are not in place Everything in life happens for a reason Disappointment comes with a lesson. It's a need to get wiser, got to work harder. In the end, it will get better. I gotta thank you for sunshine, thank you for rain, thank you
