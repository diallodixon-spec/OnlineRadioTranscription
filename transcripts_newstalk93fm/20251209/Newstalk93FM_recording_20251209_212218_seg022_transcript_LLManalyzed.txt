You're listening to Sleek Radio, 93 FM. We wear the wrath of masked crusaders Did your girl boss too close to the sun? Did they catch you having far too much fun? Come with me when they see us they'll run Something wicked this way comes I like them cooked in Gucci and in Scandal Like my whiskey sour and poison floaty float Welcome to my underworld where it gets quite dark At least you know exactly who your friends are They're the ones with magic
