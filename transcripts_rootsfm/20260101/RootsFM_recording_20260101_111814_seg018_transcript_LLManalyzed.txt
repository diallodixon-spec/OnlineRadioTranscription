20260101 111814 time is finally on our side every whisper is breathing on the bar where do we go? all the way from here it's not far how do we know? it's a case of takin' up where do we go all the way to our home don't be afraid It gives too much What I feel too soon still what i feel is wrapped up in me when hearts don't break when they're only passing through when we go away it's not far
