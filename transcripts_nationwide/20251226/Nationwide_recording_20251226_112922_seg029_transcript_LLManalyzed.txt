Just on the path, shout out loud, it's the one for me If you look up by my side, the world will be mine, it's for the one for me With this little love I found, I'll take my feet up on the ground to fly away With this little love, I did my ass with a finger, don't know what to do You just don't know what you did to me But I'm not saying I'm not going Since you gave me my attention
