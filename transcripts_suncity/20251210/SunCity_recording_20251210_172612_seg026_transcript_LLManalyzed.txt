They're not enough! They're not enough, Papa! Let me sleep in it! Oh, you feel so tender and wild Sleep in heavenly peace Sleep in heavenly peace People may care less by a special gift Taking time to be kind to one another It's that time of year when the friends are dear And you like to find your way to show the things that work for you
