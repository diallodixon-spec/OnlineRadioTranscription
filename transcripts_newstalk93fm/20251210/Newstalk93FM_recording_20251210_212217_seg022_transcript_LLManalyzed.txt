One way, they don't want me in their party day. I don't listen, nothing to say. Every time I draw, jumping up, doing what I want. Jumping up, tell them I ain't leaving. Right there, I'm too out of control But there's too much action Somebody pour a nexon Until my head gone And I'm miserable All down on the ground I'm causing trouble Look how these security watch me They don't know I'm out there I just mush up in place and I defect like a chumbe I do one way They don't want me in their prozine They don't want because I do one way
