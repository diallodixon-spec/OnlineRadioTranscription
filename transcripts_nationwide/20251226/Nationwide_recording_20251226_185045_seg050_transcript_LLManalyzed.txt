You can easily get your T-Tag from any toll collector. Just have to remember to top up by adding funds on the MyT tag app or by whatsapp save money and save time if you don't have a tag you a waste time yeah your seatbelt buckle and your driving safe use up your t tag drive and save drive like the winner you deserve to be with the t tag every time merry money mania
