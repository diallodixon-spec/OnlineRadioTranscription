20251219 142723 That's what we're very good at, grabbing people. My colleagues are buying up a storm. I see some of them out here ten times from morning. Ten times, then I have no money to leave, and then don't get paid yet, you know? But the pay is done before they even get it. Boy, I really want to encourage you to come and be a part of the activities here. We made the effort, Power 106 FM, to ensure that we're able to bring on location a number of farmers and Alvin from up in the hills. Alvin, I'm coming to you, but I need to have word with Cheyenne Christie. He was my point man. I couldn't have done this without Cheyenne. Come forward Cheyenne, come take your props. Good afternoon Cheyenne, how are you doing? I'm good Altia, how are you? I am in excellent shape because of you Cheyenne. So thank you so very much. The farmers are drawn from a number of parishes, St. Anne, St. Catherine, St. Andrew.
