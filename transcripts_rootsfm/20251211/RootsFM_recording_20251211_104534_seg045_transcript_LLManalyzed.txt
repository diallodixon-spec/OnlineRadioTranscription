miles yeah the soldiers are coming from this way the police and the residents themselves and everybody that we met along the way had a machete at hand so that when they reach somewhere where they can just cut so they were okay they were cutting their way through yes wow about 30 minutes into the walk we meet one man he's saying he's coming from Montego Bay and he lives near blessed assurance exactly where the nine mile post is he will turn and go to his yard and then we'll continue about a mile and then we'll reach blessed assurance So he decided to walk with you. He became our guide. Oh He had walked that morning right to the city to get some food The people along the city the towns within they were not selling their food because they didn't know what time they will get help, when the roads will open. So they were like, no, we are not selling everything that we have. We are keeping it for our families. So the man and many people were walking to Montego Bay to get the supplies they needed. We had people walking with gallons of fuels.
