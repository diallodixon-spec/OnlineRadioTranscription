One is the joy that you cannot waste and the other one price that you cannot fix. This is the peace that you cannot buy. Finding a way where you cannot see. Man with this system he cannot pray. I need to find relief. But behind my mind it runs. All these thoughts have trouble me. Funny to give up my baby. Funny to be on my lane. My mind running to the other side. I really need, I really need money
