2025-12-12 07:57:35 I've had more than enough. Living without your love. Till I found you. Never knew love could be like this And now that I do I wanna make up for all that I missed Here we are In what we thought was just a dream It's coming true because of you I know what love means. Because I've been living without your love. I never knew how I met you so long. Living without your love.
