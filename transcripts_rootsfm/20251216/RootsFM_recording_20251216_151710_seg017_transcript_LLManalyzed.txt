20251216 151710 all of the it coming up so i'm going to borrow a thing and after the holiday you can't pay back the loan and that is not good, they can't pay the loan you know so then buy the loan just for the holiday holiday over now, they mean a problem can't payback the loan i'm not buying nothing fancy, i don't have it at this moment to buy anything real stushy you get get what I'm saying? Yeah, man, I'm gonna depend on that right now. Life itself, that's what I'm doing. And if I chicken back my late Christmas day, I go and eat it. If I tin mackerel, I go and heat it. If I callaloo, I go ahead and heat it. Because this is what I can afford. Stick to what you can't afford, ox tailail. Don't trust the oxtail from Miss Mary's shop. Leave it alone. Buy what you normally buy. You alone live. Buy a pound of chicken and a pound of rice and you're good to go. As long as you can provide a meal.
