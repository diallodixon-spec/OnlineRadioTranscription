20251219 155005 Never be uncommon again. And whatever I said, whatever I did, I didn't mean it. I just want you back for good. See, I want your back for good. And whenever I'm on, just send me the song and I'll sing it. You'll be right up on the stretch. Just listen, let me tell you this story. I just got a letter from my baby. She's writing it all. I got to let her know. So listen, don't go slow. I read your letter just the other day. Telling me how much you're going away I wonder what could make it straight I love you baby, anyway I'll never buy you fancy clothes I'm never about to turn it over I wonder if you'd please let go Could make it go away
