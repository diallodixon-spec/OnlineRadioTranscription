15 million people before you. So one for them on Friday, tomorrow too. So it can be a case whereby, because remember they don't have the next day service anymore. Oh. That is temporary out of service. How so? So I think, I think, I'm not even sure, to be honest, why they are not doing it. Maybe it's because they need to do more investigation. Because I'm sure a lot of people would apply. A lot of people because it's only $2,000 more than the express service. And if it is $2,000 or more than the Express Service, then obviously there is a problem doing that. So it's important that we recognize all of that. So a police record is valid for six months from the date of issues. If you need a police record for a specific purpose, make sure to apply for it well in advance.
