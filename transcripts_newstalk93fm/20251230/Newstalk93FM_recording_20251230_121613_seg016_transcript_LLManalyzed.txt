20251230 121613 We be doing squats on the yacht, ghosting Somewhere on the ocean, no we ain't boasting We be ducked off, no internet posting Me kids don't think I ain't notice Trippie get a money loop, they focus, friend We ain't like them, if he don't spend We don't like him, spendin' on 10 Countin' up M's, that's my kin We so locked in, ice wind lock in. My twin looking good, we so pretty in the mirror. And we get that back together, we like seeing some mirror. And we in hot demand, we the ones with the motion. Funnels on Brazilian, body on Samoan. Bye.
