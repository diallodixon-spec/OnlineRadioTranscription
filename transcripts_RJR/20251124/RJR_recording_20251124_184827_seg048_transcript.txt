Meanwhile, head coach Hubert Busby believes the Wrecker Girls have a right blend of players to compete with some of the best in the world. Speaking at Monday's press conference, Busby says that with notable absentees, this presents an opportunity for younger players. That's why they're not in this group. But we look at, you know, through the course of the last year, you know, we've done a really good job, I feel, of integrating a lot of young players in. Sometimes, like I said, the results hadn't really gone their way, but the players who we've integrated in, some are very few from our own youth team.
