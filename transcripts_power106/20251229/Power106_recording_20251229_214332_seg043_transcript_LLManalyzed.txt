20251229 214332 Tomorrow, now, yesterday, the whole day, I do some cleaning up with some washing cars. Maybe I close them one time, and I just put them down, but I just do some good washing cars. I don't want no dirty clothes with me for the new air. Everything just clean, pretty, and I don't want to fall up, put in a suitcase, or a barrel, or something. So, everything clean and nice. And the room that me in here, all door, them one part look off, them come and look on the part that look off the top or something. But from me in here, it's nice, you know? Tile off, paint off, everything inside. They're cool, so. They are right there, boss. And we just got through here, you know. And just, you know, just go and pick up on yourself and keep on yourself, see, you know, yeah. And Silly's, she got herself. And Chandel. Yeah, and the other race, I won them.
