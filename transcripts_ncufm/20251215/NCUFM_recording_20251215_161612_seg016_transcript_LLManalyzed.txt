Not that it'd ever sell them. Let's see, there's my wife. She's been a real asset to me. It's got to be at least $5 million right there. My boy just got his braces off, and hey, he looks like a million bucks. I don't think you understand. I meant real assets. What does money have to offer that my family doesn't? Well, it would definitely provide a lot of security. My wife's been with me through the toughest of times. What more security do I need than that? Well, still, you could buy a lot with $10 million. You can't buy the feeling I had watching my boy hit his first home run in Little League. Wealth. There's more than one way to measure it.
