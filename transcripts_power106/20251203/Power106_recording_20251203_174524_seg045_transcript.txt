This is Power. Listening once again. With candy canes and silver lanes aglow. It's beginning to looks a lot like Christmas. Ties in every store. But the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be on your own front door. A pair of hop-along boots and a pistol that chooses the wish of Barney and Ben. Dolls that'll talk and will go for a walk is the hope for Janice and Jenny.
