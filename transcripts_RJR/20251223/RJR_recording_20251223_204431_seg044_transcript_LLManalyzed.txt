20251223 204431 still have symptoms but I'd encourage her to speak to her doctor to find out if there was any issue that happened to any nerve that could have caused or could possibly cause a long-term nerve issue for her so that she's at least aware and then of course there are certain things that specifically we can recommend to assist with that and if she wants to come to one of our Eden experiences it might actually be useful for her because then we'll teach her how to apply these different protocols to improve her situation. Which is kind of what we do at Eden Experience. It's not just giving people information to help them. It's actually giving them some treatment protocols that will actually help their specific types of issues. So maybe this is something that she might find interesting. And if that's the case, Mrs. G, what's a phone number that she could call or anyone else that could call who might want to come visit us at our ranch?
