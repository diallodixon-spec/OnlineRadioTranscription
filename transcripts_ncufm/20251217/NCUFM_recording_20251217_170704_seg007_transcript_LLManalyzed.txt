20251217 170704 news, commanding officer in charge of the Newport West Police Formation, Superintendent of Police Rachelle McGibbon-Scott, says the festive season traditionally brings increased commercial activity and, unfortunately, increased criminal activity. She says criminals are operating sophisticated scams, especially through social media platforms such as TikTok, where they post videos of high-value motor vehicles, often captured near the wharf, and advertise them for sale at prices far below their true market value. She says the scammers encourage potential buyers to quickly inquire about the price's locations and deposits, often without proper verification, and in many cases victims are pressured to make online payments or meet individuals at the wharf with large cash deposits. Superintendent McGivin Scott indicated that the Newport West police have recorded an alarming increase in reports of victims who have deposited significant sums of money ranging from 250,000 to 500,000
