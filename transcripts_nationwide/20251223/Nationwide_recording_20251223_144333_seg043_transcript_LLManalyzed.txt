20251223 144333 I will be there to help you understand It's all about love It's all about not what we take, not what we leave behind When the tides of life are getting high When you've lost count of all the tears you've cried Close your eyes and look into the dark You'll find the light opening up your heart It's all about love, it's all about love It's all about leaning on each other from the heart
