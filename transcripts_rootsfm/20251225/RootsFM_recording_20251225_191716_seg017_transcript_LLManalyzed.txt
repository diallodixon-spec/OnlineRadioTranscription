20251225 191716 I just want you for my own More than you could ever know Make my wish come true All I want for Christmas is you You, baby Oh, I won't ask for much this Christmas I won't even wish for snow And'm just gonna keep on waiting Underneath the mistletoe I won't make a list and send it To the North Pole for singing I won't even stay awake to Hear the magic rain declare Cause I just want you here tonight Holding on to me so tight What more can I do? Oh, baby, all I want for Christmas is you. Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.
