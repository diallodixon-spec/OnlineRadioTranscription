That love is everlasting How it gets so normal How it's so comfortable for sleep Man, I just got down and beat up the devil I know me, me no respond to what do wrongs Me no in my heat, rather sing songs and do the right Wanna listen me, I know better It not easy, time testing but I'm strong With love on my mind, loving my thoughts, carrying on. Why nobody no believe in our love again? Because every love that lost, nobody no believe in that God again. Seems our faith is lost. Nobody no believe, and it hurts my heart. Turn the lights on, the world's's so dark still i believe that love is everlasting yes i know love is everlasting yeah i believe love is everlasting
