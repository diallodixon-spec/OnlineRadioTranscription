So I did say to the Water Commission person, you know, please let me know, is there such an app? Because I need to know. I need to know, is there something that does say, okay, there's a leak there and this is a license plate. Tell me if you have a contractor, because I'm dead serious about this. And I'm saying, you know, if it is that you do have contractors, you have to demand that you have a contract. You have to have a contract, you have to have a license plate, you have a license plate. Tell me if you have a contractor, because I'm dead serious about this. And I'm saying, you know, if it is that you do have contractors, you have to demand of them professionalism. Yes. These are some serious times. Very. It could have not been me. It could have been a hatted neighbor who just a driver see a man bend down in front of a wall, looking suspicious and him can't explain himself. And it could have gone any other way. And he would have asked for your ID, you don't have none to show, you start to flip and be flippant about your response. The man tell me, he's just a low level plumber with water commission. You know it's crazy, it's crazy.
