Sometimes bad news will arrive and we will weep and we will wonder. Sometimes we'll get angry. We'll shout with the question, why? And in those sometimes, God is here. God understands. God extends a plan to take care of you, not abandon you, give you the future you hope for. Sometimes, rains are going to come. God has always stood with us in the sometimes. He'll stand with us.
