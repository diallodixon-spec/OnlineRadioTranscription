20251219 165536 Yes Drivetime Family, we are 5 minutes away from the end of the drive week. I'm sure you enjoyed not just Flashback Friday but the entirety of this week. I hope you enjoy as you enter and go through the rest of the Sabbath with joy, peace, love in your heart. Yes, man, that is the plan as the sun begins to set, Even it's the end of the year, almost at the end of year, you know, it's the sunset, you know, blink. So much to have a happy rest of preparation day, happy preparation night, happy Sabbath when it comes.
