20260102 201810 Let me tell you what hurts the most I'm a convicted felon and I can't work No matter where I go I try to get paid They never give me the job cause they are a free bet I'm a sicko, my boy, I'm sick. Robbin' and I'm hearin' everybody in it. That's what the state life of a country's trying to make me. But you don't trouble nobody. Probation say to trouble nobody. Stay out of trouble, don't trouble nobody, and I'ma try not to trouble nobody. The party weekend starts't stop tonight. Hey, I got it.
