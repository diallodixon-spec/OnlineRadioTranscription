try to lock down something to prevent people from having it. Those same people go to the nth degree to try and have it. For instance, prohibition in the United States to lock down alcohol.

It's a failed exercise to try and stop people from getting drugs. As that dance in the White House will soon realize. What you do is you try to be there to advise and to steer in the right direction. It doesn't always work. But that role should be the role of the parent. Now, does that absolve government from any responsibility to protect its citizens? No. My question is, have they gone too far?
