20251216 213923 Who has carried you this far? Cause love sees farther Than you ever could In this moment heaven's working Everything for your good Tell your heart to beat again Close your eyes and breathe it in Let the shadows fall away Step into the light of grace Yesterday's the closing door You don't live there anymore Say goodbye to where you've been And tell your heart to beat again Your heart to beat again
