20251225 184841 You are the only one You're my world, you're my dream You're my morning sun You are the world, you are the sun You are the music, you are the music You're the song that plays over and over again in my head. You are the words, you are the music. You're the tune that I leave up and sing every morning in the past. It's true I dedicate each passing day to you, now and forevermore Your love is what I'm looking for, don't you understand?
