We deserve it. Say we deserve it. Yeah, we deserve it. Set all your friends and them. Set all the girls all the girls and them Real your friends and them And let's get it started I say, I say, oh yo, oh yo, yo Oh, so come on, say make a joke But let we start it by the joke, by the joke Let we start it, by the joke Party on the road, it's a party on the road
