20251229 151313 I feel your frequency from miles away. You come alive with one wine, baby. With you, I want to dance the night away. One jam, turn a lifetime, baby. So don't feel away. You don't like the fast life Look on the bright side I go take the blame I just want you come and fight it up Just a little winding up Come and meet me behind the truck and we rev it up Whole day keep throwing it back, I know When you're ready, I go over here. Lali, you go over there. But we could meet in the middle and start a bacchanal, play in the middle.
