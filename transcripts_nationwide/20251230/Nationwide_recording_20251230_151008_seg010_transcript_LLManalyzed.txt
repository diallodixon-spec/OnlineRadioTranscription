20251230 151008 So downright disgrace But long as I got you by my side I don't care what your people say Your friends tell you it's no future in loving a married man If I can't see you when I want I'll see you when I can If loving you is wrong I don't wanna be right If loving you wrong I don't want to be right I'm not wrong before, I just can't live without you No, no way I got a wife and two little children Depending on what you do Nationwide Now many men will try to tell you bad things about me Oh baby let them try, I know one day they'll last till death And there will be no cause or reason for you to doubt me Cause what I feel is real
