I never miss you, baby Monday and Tuesday Oh, not at all Not at all, not at all, oh lord So don't tell me nothing When still for nothing And start the jam Jam, jam, jam, boy Me always like rockin' I feel it, so'll know I'm a trill. Hey, hey hey, hey, I invented party, I invented party. So when the dogs go bash up the wave and muck up the place any day any day Anyway you're calling me name, you're calling me names And when they talk about jump up and cool off, turn up, pick up, girl, turn up the waves and calling me name, they're calling me names
