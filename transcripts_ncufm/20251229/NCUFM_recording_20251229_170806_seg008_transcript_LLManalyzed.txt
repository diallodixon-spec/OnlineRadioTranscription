20251229 170806 The National Environment and Planning Agency, NEPA, is urging Jamaicans to report sightings of wildlife displaced by Hurricane Melissa. This comes following reports of animals turning up outside their usual habitats. Deputy CEO for Environmental Management and Sustainability, Anthony McKenzie, says there have been confirmed reports of crocodiles in Treasure Beach, St. Elizabeth, likely displaced from the Black River area by the storm. Speaking on GIS's Get the Facts, Mr. McKenzie stressed that members of the public should not attempt to capture or harm the animals, but instead report sightings directly to NEPA. He notes that the agency has game wardens and partnerships with the zoos and wildlife sanctuaries across the island to safely assess, rescue or relocate displaced or injured animals. He is also advising that many species are protected under the Wildlife Protection Act, with fines now increased to as much as $5 million for violations.
