Look into your heart, you'll find There is nothing left to hide Take me as I am, take my life I would give it all, I would take my life I would get it all I would sacrifice I would revolt when I was broken I wouldn't believe I wouldn't believe, no Man through a storm, no use in hoping That you would come rescue me Somehow your love set me free And I, I can let my life go
