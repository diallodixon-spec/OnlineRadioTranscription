20251222 104035 I don't want a Christmas like this again. I lose a lot of people. But let me send happy holidays, Mr. Mullins, you're dead, somebody's going to take your work, so you might as well go live your life, because as you're dead somebody will take your work. You're not even calling it to your dead.
