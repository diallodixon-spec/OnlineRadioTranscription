20251215 154733 that I was crippled by fear, fear of the future, fear of failure, fear of the unknown. But I believe the Lord would have bring me to a point of my life of brokenness. And one thing I learned about brokenness, people of God, is that a broken and a contrite heart, he will not despise. And many times we find ourselves going through different situations. I was struggling with rejection also. And I realized that God was just using these things to pull me closer to him. Sometimes we look for solutions but those are just temporary solutions. I understand that in his presence there is fullness of joy and you know when we feel rejected we must know that we are accepted by the Lord. Oh I navigate, I keep getting closer to him. The Bible says draw near to me and I'll draw near to you. Call unto me and I'll answer thee and show thee great and mighty things which thou knowest not. If you find yourself just going through a hard time, maybe fear of failure like myself, fear of the unknown or fear of the future.
