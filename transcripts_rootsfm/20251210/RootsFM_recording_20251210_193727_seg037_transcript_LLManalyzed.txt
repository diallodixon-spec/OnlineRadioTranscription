It's time you smile You're a genie in disguise. You're a wonder and surprise. And let your back on me now. You're the one that I've been waiting for forever. So let the stars show me again again Hurry, hurry, step right on in Can't afford to pass if I'm Guaranteed to make it right Let the sun show again
