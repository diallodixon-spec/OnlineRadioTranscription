20251223 205142 A lot of my friends from Sportsmax say, yeah man, I listened to you on the dock last night. I said, you listen to the show? I said, yes. A lot of people, I get stopped and asked about this program a lot more than some other things, and I'm saying, what, really? Yeah, so you have many fans on the road, doc, and the people appreciate the way you present your talk. Because remember, if you want to really be front and center of the program, all you need to do is just make the suggestion about the topic you want to hear discussed. Send that topic to 394-5433 and our producer, Mrs. Latorre Lawrence, will organize that for you. And Doc and I will be obliged to take care of you with the presentation of that topic. That's the program this evening. I want to thank my producer LaToya Lawrence, I want to thank the technical maestro Andrew Anderson, and I thank Ms. Michelle Dean. I almost said Mrs. Dean but then she's never married to her father or brother. There are some young men who have a chance, only some. Yeah I want to thank
