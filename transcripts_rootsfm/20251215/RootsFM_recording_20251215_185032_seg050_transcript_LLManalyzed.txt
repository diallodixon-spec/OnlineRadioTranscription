20251215 185032 My body and soul, oh girl Oh yeah, yeah, yeah Suddenly I think I found the lover that I'm searching for Oh yeah All incontinence that will never, never fail Hearing angel voices saying love prevails Love tender fragrance takes my heart to nails So baby, do it to me Tease me, tease me, tease me baby Until I lose control Tease me with your love until I lose control Take all my body and soul, oh girl And even if my mind should resist I know my heart will still insist That there is heaven in your kiss Sunshine in your smile
