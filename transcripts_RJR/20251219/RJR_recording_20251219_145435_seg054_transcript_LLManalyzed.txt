20251219 145435 I've been there before Everything is going right Remember the darkest part of the night It's just before daylight It was good to talk and expose my thoughts When I don't know how I survive Maybe I know the weight of the burden I carry Every night on my mind The only people I can turn to Are the worst worst to Life now always fun But better must come This one is for all who want give up and done I've been there before What if I fight to find Who don't need a thousand bucks to ride I've been there before.
