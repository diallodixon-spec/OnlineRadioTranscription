20260102 215343 Step down the backstair on my toes then out the door They didn't hear, now they won't see me anymore Cause I can take that nine to five like it's a ball Cause I'm a wanderer Just a wanderer And so it's up and out and on and off the road Won't have no troubles cause the whole world is my home No need to worry cause I sell the man my load Cause I'm a Wanderer I'm a wanderer I travel every place Cause I'm a wonderer Who kneels to outer space Cause I'm a Wonderer Got no time Cause I'm a Wanderer
