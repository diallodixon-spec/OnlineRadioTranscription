MAGA as in poor people, when MAGA says to MAGA people that, hello, we're gonna take you off welfare and all of these things, the people need to have an idea of how this is going to be done okay if you come to me and you say to me I'm going to take you all welfare see immediately as he said it I said that's a good thing and he's happy but now I ask how and he's telling me to little shut up and listen to him and and he has no answer for me and I'm waiting I wait for five seconds I'm watching the clock ticking he has no response he just wants to tell me again what I just heard before that MAGA wants to take people off welfare
