if an executor is a name that you don't need to name an executor because let me tell you it will prevent a lot of confusion so let's just say you have five beneficiaries and the five of them can't get along and for whatever reason you don't name an executor imagine the mess you know that can happen when it's time for the five beneficiaries to decide okay who's who's going to step up? Who's going to make the decision? So please ensure you appoint an executor. We advise that you should appoint at least two executors. The law says you can have a maximum of four, but it is best to have at least two executives, all right? Oh, there was a second part. Can my children be my executors? Certainly, as long as they are over 18, your children can be your executors. Most persons think that a relative, a family member cannot be an executor or a beneficiary.
