20251225 104024 I'm bringing sun up to the beach, you know Just let the relationship breathe I is not your man, you is not my girl Until we re-soul So you could drum up all who you want And I go wild and full of what I like, yeah And if you feel too wild on everybody inside, yeah Like yourself, like yourself, like yourself Until you fall asleep You know I love to whine So don't come and try to interrupt me vibe Even if I were in the room with an ex-man You will have to get no shade The thing that's happened when we party hard I ain't trying to stop you from your plan at all Look at Bumper, are you ready to jam? Are you looking for y'all? Ready to do what you want So when you're ready, you can jam and follow your heart and let the world follow your life
