20251212 153933 I shake it off, I shake it off My heart breakers on a break break break break break again My fingers on a fake fake fake fake fake baby I'm just gonna shake shake shake shake shake Shake it off, shake it off Ooh, I'm blinded by the lights Though I can't sleep until I feel your touch I've been trying to call I've been on my own for long enough Maybe you can show me how to love Maybe I'm going through a drought You don't even have to do too much You can turn me on with just a touch
