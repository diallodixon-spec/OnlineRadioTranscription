20251218 213225 Welcome back to the pastor. Mr. Hayes, God bless you. One of the most satisfying things for a man is when you look back and see where you're coming from. Pastor, I remember when I started business in Kingston, you know, I used to go to Halfway Tree and eat, dump in an aisle. And I don't want to tell you what I used to do. Oh, you remember the dog soup, huh? Yeah. Oh, you got, you got caught in that too? Pastor, there's something about dog soup which has been up until today, you know. I was well known in the half of the area and then normally I would be at the soup and drinking that soup and man would be like, boy, did you drink that too? This is true, you don't know it. You know why?
