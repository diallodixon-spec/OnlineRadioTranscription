============================================================

There are no hard feelings if you only want to act like lovers do For a night or two And sometimes in the morning go back to being someone you never knew You never knew Baby don't you worry You ain't gonna hurt me tonight You won't be the worst time If this is how it is, then she kiss me again And say you don't want this heart, boy, sorry it broke Told me every time she touched, just goes up in smoke Only stay a couple nights, then she gon' be gone I said I said baby you should know that's what I want She said you don't want this hard, but it can't be fixed And I ain't ready to try on a night like this But if you still wanna stay, there ain't nothing right
