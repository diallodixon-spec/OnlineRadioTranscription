20251226 142416 I'm not sure I'm worthy of Losing you is painful to me I don't wanna let you down I don't wanna lead you on I don't wanna hold you back from where you might belong You would never ask me why My heart is so disguised I just can't live a lie anymore I would rather hurt myself than to ever make you cry There's nothing left to say but goodbye
