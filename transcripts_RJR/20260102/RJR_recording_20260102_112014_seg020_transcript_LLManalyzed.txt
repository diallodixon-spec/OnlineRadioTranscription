20260102 112014 that we approach it. Another one here. Greetings Mr. Earl. The police can't continue in the way they carry out their job. Too much killing by the police. They are shooting, not protecting. It can't continue like this. Not a day without shooting, or plural. That's from Billy. Thanks very much for your comment, Billy. This is one of the things we need to stop doing. Good morning, Andre. One thing Jamaicans must stop doing is cutting in at the filter light. It is a dangerous practice by motorists. Just past a six vehicle collision between my lines and Boulevard. This was sent at 11.05 a.m. Oh my goodness, I hope nobody was injured in that six-vehicle collision. Mullines on Boulevard. Anybody near there seen anything like that? 11.05 this was sent and it's now 11.20.
