20251216 211310 I can only imagine Surrounded by your glory, one where my heart feels Will I dance for you Jesus, or in awe of you be still? Will I stand in your your presence Or to my knees when I fall When I sing hallelujah Will I be able to speak at all I can only imagine Yeah I can only imagine Surrounded by your glory What will my heart feel? Will I dance for you, Jesus? Or in awe, will you be still? Or will I stand in your way?
