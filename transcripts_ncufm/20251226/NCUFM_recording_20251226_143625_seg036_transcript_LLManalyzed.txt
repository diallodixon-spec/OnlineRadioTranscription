Be a cheerful giver. You'd be surprised the joy that comes with it. Heavenly Father, I want to thank you for the gift of your love and the many blessings that you pour into our lives. Help us to be cheerful givers, not out of obligation, but from hearts full of gratitude and full of love. Teach us to share generously with our time, with our resources and with our kindness so that others may feel your love through us. Bless our efforts and fill us with joy as we bless others. In your name I pray. Amen.
