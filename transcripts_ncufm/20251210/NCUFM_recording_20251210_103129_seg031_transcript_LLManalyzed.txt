unless you will ship the item or the agent stand up right there when they might inspect it. Listen, customs job is to protect the borders, collect revenue and to facilitate trade. They will not collect or store shipment. They will inspect it and somebody will have to present it for inspection. So how customs ever get so much cost in there? Tracy, and the customs are alone involved in the clearance process, even though it's them we tend to talk about. Look at it this way. Shipment delayed, talk to your airline agent. Missing items, talk to your freight forwarder. The charges surprise you now. Call customs. But remember to collect your sign and stamp decoration or C number from your agent. So when you call customs, they can better help you. We're never too old for learning. Some miss know it all. Want when customs roll on your item them now. You mean detain it? But that's only for restricted or prohibited items Tracy.
