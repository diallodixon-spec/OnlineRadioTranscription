I'll be back on my own, na na Nobody should call my phone, nobody should call my phone Na na This is my last heartbreak song, this is my last Heartbreak song, na na I'll be good on my own, i'll be good on My own, na na Why are you so quick to leave When we both can make it worse When I'm gone, I'll make you nervous If you hurt me, I deserve it I've been acting foolishly Forgetting what you were You start loving me, I know this But even chaos serves a purpose It feels good to love somebody And somebody loves you back So don't give in
