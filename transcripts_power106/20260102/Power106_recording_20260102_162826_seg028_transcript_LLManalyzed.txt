20260102 162826 Everybody calling me man. As I said, people from all over have been shouting at me and saying this conversation with John Jesse needs to go on. But for my party brother Jesse, the need to keep Bellman Road active. Keep Bellman Road active because many people brother Jesse have fed up. Some have even walked away with workers. You understand? Because sometimes we feel neglected and left out. You know, I'm telling the truth. We are human. We have feelings. So, to the chairman, the GenSec, we need to keep Bellman Trude active once more. And we want to say, welcome Dr. Chang. We hear your message for the new year. I don't know if you heard it. I heard it. Yes, so it was very strong and firm. So it seems like it's back for the New Year. I'm very happy to see him back. Yes. Very happy to see Dr. Chang back. Yes.
