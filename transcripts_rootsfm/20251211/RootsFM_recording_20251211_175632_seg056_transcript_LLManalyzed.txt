Another drink, another cigarette Lord, I'd try anything to forget But the memory of her burning touch Just keeps on returning Just keeps returning Oh, you gypsy, you heart-breaking gypsy I said, gypsy, won't you ever come home? Who's going to kiss my eyes? My eyes, my eyes? Gypsy like you do. Who's going to tell me?
