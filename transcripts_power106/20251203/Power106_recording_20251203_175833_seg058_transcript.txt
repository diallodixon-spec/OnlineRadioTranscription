Daddy a rocker, the music non-stop It's a boom shaka thug It's a Rockin' Christmas time A rockin' Christmas time Walkin' on the eve, you feel the Christmas breeze It lightin' up the trees, crowd is up to the squeeze Dancin' in the streets, in the grave We can be till a.m. 4 o'clock, and still a-licking by. It's a rocking Christmas time. A rocking Christmas time. Music gets so sweet, a real Christmas treat. Crown it to the max, and it turning up the heat. It's a rockin' Christmastime A boom-a-lip-a-tay-a-dime Everybody rock, boom-shak-a-fly
