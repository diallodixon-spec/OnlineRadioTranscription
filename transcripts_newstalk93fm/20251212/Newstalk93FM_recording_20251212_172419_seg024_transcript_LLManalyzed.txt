20251212 172419 to love somebody and somebody loves you back so don't give in to your dreams, boy cause I'll be here for a lifetime you don't have to pretend to bow because it's crystal clear now now guess it's bye to the good times and I'll be gone by the sunrise I'll be better on my own I'll be better off on my own now now nobody should call my own Nobody should call my phone This is my last heartbreak song I'll be good on my own Oh, no, no, no.
