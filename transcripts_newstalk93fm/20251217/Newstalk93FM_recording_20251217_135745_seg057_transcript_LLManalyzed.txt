20251217 135745 We'll never let you go One thing I have to say to you I just love when it can make me gravitate to you Give me the compass, let me navigate to you Fly up and say that my way to you Deep as the blue sea Your love's flowing into me And even though the waves out from this loving wave just love me. Deep as Lucy, deep as Lucy. I said this love is so strong. We won't run, no, no, no. Loving me deep as Lucy. This love is as deep as can be. Deep as the dark blue, yeah? So accurate. So deep as, baby, so deep as. I said I need your love. No one's deeper than you and me. Never, them can't test it out.
