20260101 103627 When I think of all the years I wanna be with you Wake up every morning with you in my bed That's precisely what I plan to do And you know one of these days When I get my money right Buy you everything and show you all the finer things in life Will forever be enough So there ain't no need to rush But one day I won't be able to ask you loud enough I'll say, will you marry me? I swear that I won't mean it, I'll say Will you marry me? Sing it Oh yeah
