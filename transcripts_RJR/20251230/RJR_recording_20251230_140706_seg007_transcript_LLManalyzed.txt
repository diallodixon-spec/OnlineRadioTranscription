20251230 140706 I don't like the way he's looking at you I'm starting to think you want him too Am I crazy? Have I lost you? Even though I know you love me, can't I help it? I turn my chain music up And I'm puffing my chest I'm getting ready to face you. You can call me obsessed. It's not your fault that they hurt me. No disrespect. It's my right to be hellish. I still can't get over you.
