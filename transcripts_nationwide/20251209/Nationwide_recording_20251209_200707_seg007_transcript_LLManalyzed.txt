Lungs are responsible for breathing in oxygen, which is what we use for the good processes, and breathing out carbon dioxide, which is the waste that is produced. That is the role of the lung. So the body wants more oxygen and it wants less carbon dioxide. It doesn't want to keep it. Yes. Persons will understand that if they look at their body the way people look at a car for example that Exhaust pipe is what lets out the carbon monoxide, which is similar to what we breathe out in the carbon dioxide Yes, it is waste you don't want to keep it and Persons understand that if you breathe too much of that waste that the car lets out it can kill you Yes, and you have to similarly understand that if a lot of that carbon dioxide builds up in blood the same thing will happen and therefore your body will try all it needs to do to get the carbon dioxide out and the other end of the car the air filter takes in oxygen which is very important
