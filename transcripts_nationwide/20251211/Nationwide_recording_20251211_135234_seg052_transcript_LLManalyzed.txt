You just splash it on the world eh eh Him have one up here, one down there One in and over, one down of here One she's a lawyer, one she's a doctor One where they work with a little contractor One down the east, one down the west Him have one up north and two down south One sell cigarettes and they run about the land eh Young man you do girlie girlie You just splash it in the world eh eh She come first the other night them going out, them pick on you first One a sell star, one work in a bar A she can't smile when the two of them a spark One get tea, get two, one fresh tea, fresh tea And he no drink no other milk But Betty, you too girly, girly You just a trash it on me
