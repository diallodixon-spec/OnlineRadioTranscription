20251231 130907 I gave my guy my word of honor to be faithful And I'm gonna you best be believing I won't be deceiving my guy As a matter of opinion I think he's tough My opinion is he's the cream of the crop As a matter of chance to be excited He's my ideal as a matter of fact And no muscle man could take my hand But my guy, my guy No handsome face could ever take the place of my guy My My guy, my guy. We might be a movie star, but when it comes to being happy, we are the star dimension. Check me, check me away from my guy.
