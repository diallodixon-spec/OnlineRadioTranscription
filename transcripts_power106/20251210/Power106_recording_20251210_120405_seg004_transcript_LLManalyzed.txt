says the repairing of roofs in the affected parishes is a priority of the government. This work will be undertaken by the Jamaica Defense Force, Heart NSTA Trust, and delegations from the Caribbean and Africa. So in addition to that, we're going to be working with Heart NSTA Trust to be able to provide young people to work with the JDF in repairing those roofs that have been damaged. In addition to that, you would have heard that there are delegations coming in from various countries that will be helping in that effort. So we have teams coming from Guyana, from Ghana, from Ethiopia, and also from Rwanda. The JDF will only be repairing roofs that are structurally sound, so they need to be structurally sound. I know Minister Vaz is also looking at house wiring because that's very important because we will need to rewire many of these homes.
