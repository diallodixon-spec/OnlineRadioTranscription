NHT giving money, NIS giving money. They don't know who qualifies for what, because people are going into the homes, investigating, taking pictures, saying this, you get this, you get that. Some people need titles, some people don't need titles. There's some confusion. And I'm asking you personally, I'm asking someone else also, if you can get NHT, NIS to come on and explain how do you qualify for the $500,000 grant given by NHT, and then there's money I heard which you can qualify for from NIS? I am not quite sure. And the people are not sure, so they ask me to come on. Yeah, because they can't pick you up down there. They don't pick up RGR in Newtown, Black River. Wow, wow. We're trying to address that now, yes. I'm trying to be the voice of the people. I'm not one to just season people who call all the while. I crave your indulgence. All right, sister. You have given us a whole lot. Thank you so much. Yes, and we need to also acknowledge the role of the church right across what is happening in the Western area. No doubt. Church doing churching.
