Why I tell you I'm doing liquor by a little little by little morning Rush tell you okay One more morning, mr. Taylor I paid my friend's light bill three days after the storm at an outlet in May pain GPS is still sending a bill reflecting that it was not paid. And I can't find the receipt. Oh, jeez. Well, if you paid it at an outlet, it will take sometimes more than two working days for it to be reflected. And so by then, the bill might have been generated to see so generated with the errors coming forward but eventually system will pick it up so check again to see whether or not you know you can check online I can call GPS
