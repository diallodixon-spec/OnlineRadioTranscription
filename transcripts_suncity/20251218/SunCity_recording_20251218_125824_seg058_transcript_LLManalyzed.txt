20251218 125824 Sometimes it hurts to love so bad When you know you've given all you can Sometimes it hurts to do even that You do your best but still it's much too sad Sometimes the pain is just too much And it hurts like hell That's the way it feels True love, it has no hiding place It's not something you just put away. It's always there inside of you.
