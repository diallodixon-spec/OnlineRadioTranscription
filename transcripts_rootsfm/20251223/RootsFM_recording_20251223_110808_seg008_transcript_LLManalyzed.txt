Eight minutes after the Avalon o'clock, we do apologize. We will not be having our, uh, Bernice Brown will not be on, at the bar this morning. You know, everybody hunking on down to get their shopping and getting everything together for the holiday season. Mention the holiday season. Jacob, what do you say? We wish you a eerie, eerie Christmas. Oh, year and New Year's are just the same. Christmas on a real fucking day. We wish you an eerie Christmas.
