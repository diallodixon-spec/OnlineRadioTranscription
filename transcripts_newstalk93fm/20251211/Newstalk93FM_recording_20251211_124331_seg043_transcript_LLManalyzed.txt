============================================================

The world's so dark Turn the lights on Turn the lights thing, a love is all I'm bring. Come on, Papri, I'm a little lyrical sling like King David. And rhythm like this, we not play with love. A long time on'm a DJ in a dance. A long time, I'm a chant in a dance. I come from nice up New York. I come from Nice up Jamaica. I watch you drink, dance off the love. Dance off the cough, lick off the love.
