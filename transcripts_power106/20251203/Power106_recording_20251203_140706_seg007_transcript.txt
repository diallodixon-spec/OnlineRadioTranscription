============================================================

The great thing is to respect yourself. Only by that, only by self-respect, will you compel others to respect you. You treat people with dignity and respect, even if you don't know them, and even if don't agree with them. I'm not concerned with you liking or disliking me. All I ask is that you respect me as a human being. One of the most sincere forms of respect is actually listening to what another has to say. The root of respect is not the full understanding of other people. It's the recognition of people's non-negotiable humanity.
