2025-12-12 06:59:27 remember that Christmas is really about giving, with Christ being the gift to the world that we celebrate at this time of year. That being said, sometimes the best gift we can give ourselves is the removal of the weight of expectations. Chances are we're all going to be a little short of something this Christmas, but none like it bother you. Let's choose to focus on what we have. We have life, we have hope, we have opportunity. Let's see the glass as half full this Christmas. That's all we have time for today. Join us next time when we'll highlight happenings round about J.A. Until then, I'm Joy Kelly with Studio Engineer André Salias. What good. A production of the Jamaica Information Service, the voice of Jamaica.
