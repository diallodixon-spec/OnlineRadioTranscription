20251226 131911 I won't make a list and send it to the North Pole for singing I won't even stay awake to hear the magic rain declare Cause I just want you here tonight Holding my heart to me so tight What more can do? Oh, baby, all I want for Christmas is you. You, baby. All the lights are shining so brightly everywhere. And I saw the children laugh and feel the air. And everyone is singing. I hear them laughing and playing. Santa won't you pray? Santa won't you really pray?
