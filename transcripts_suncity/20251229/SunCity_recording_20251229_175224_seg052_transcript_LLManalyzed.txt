Fuck I no no money but me no response No abiding city while pressure feel me rash And when him they affraid him with him potent But him never did a look back, never did a glance Never knew him would a trouble over like an avalanche Mama don't need not the hole and him don't buy a roll out Catalyne not a letter nor a 50 cent stamp If father want a shoe I can not go to remittance When me hear the boy get deep, you know me buy stuff Send him back home to south, cause him dey dey on a rock Oh, my goodness.
