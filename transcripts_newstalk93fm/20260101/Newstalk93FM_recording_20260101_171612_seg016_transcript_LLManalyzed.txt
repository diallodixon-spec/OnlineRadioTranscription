And you don't try to stop me vibe, so don't say You do what you want, I do what I like You ain't have to get no sugar When it comes to party, I ain't such a man And I know when we come to party, we don't have a beat You don't tell me why not who I want, you go Why not who you like, why not who you like Like yourself, like yourself, like yourself.
