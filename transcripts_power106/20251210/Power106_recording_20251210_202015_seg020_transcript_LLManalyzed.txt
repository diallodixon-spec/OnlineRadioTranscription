there is a situation of denial of health care. But Dr. Barnett, if that is so very significant, very important for us to have health care as entrenched, I think that is the word in our constitution, is there any hope that that will change? Yes, I think we need to move towards that. Though, unlike a right, like say the right of freedom of movement, it doesn't have the same economic consequences. If you say that health care is an enforceable right, then it means that the court could make an order that you get health care.
