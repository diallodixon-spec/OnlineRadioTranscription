You're listening to Sleek Radio, 93 FM. And rhythm like this, we not play with love A long time on the DJ in a dance A long time on a chant in a dance Me come fi nice up to here, yeah Me come fi nice of Jamaica Me watch a drek Dance off say love Dance off to cough Liquor say love Charge the wine say love People really see it and have laugh. Promoter and his eyes, you have to laugh. Born and grow in Jamaica. No matter where I go, I'm not leaving. I said I'm not leaving Jamaica.
