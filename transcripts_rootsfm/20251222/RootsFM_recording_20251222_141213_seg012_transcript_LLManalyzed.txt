20251222 141213 to you. How you doing? Hope you having a good time. Thank you so much for making it roots. Radio. We should turn up your radio. You know, the Prince of afternoon radio is on your station. We're going to be giving you good vibes musically, of course, because we're coming to a close for 2025. And we're going to fix things up in terms of ringing out the old and bringing the new. So we're going to be having what we call old school vibes straight back until Thursday. Yeah, I call it the groove of closing twenty twenty-five. Good afternoon. Turn up your radio.
