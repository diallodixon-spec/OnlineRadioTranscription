At that time, the Fed's dot plot or interest rate path indicated that the benchmark federal funds rate should have been hiked to between 5% per annum and 5.5% per annum during the year 2023 right down to the 2.5 to 2.75% per annum originally programmed for in order to correct this big mistake and it was spot on. U.S. budget deficit for the fiscal year 2022 was $1.4 trillion.
