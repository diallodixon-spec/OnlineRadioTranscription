I'ma shine your ego bright For like F for the night If I'm broke now my business I'll shine your ego bright for like F For the night F and E, S, S, E If it be the reason why your papa want to jealous me If he want to take I'm serious, I'll do top speed No need to resonate, I'm on a different frequency I don't think it's necessary I'll be damned if there's somebody that could do like me When I be like Mo Salah coming up the right wing I call to your defender, if you're not careful. Finesse, you know say me I'm a snitch. Let you kill it, I will carry gold. If me I get money past you if you not careful. Ah, finesse. If I broke down my business. I'ma try your ego bright. While I get money, I do.
