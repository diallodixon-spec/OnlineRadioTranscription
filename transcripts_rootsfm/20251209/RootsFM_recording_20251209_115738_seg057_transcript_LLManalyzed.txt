I see you as my brother, always like that. But if I can't trust my brother enough, I'll tell you tell yourself, I got to go, because I know. But the earth can sweep it run. They are like the trees they can't breathe. They shall show it. And I know, but the earth can wash it too. And there no bad sign on to do it Attention slowly turn away, turn away And anything when you clean and pure we a cut them off Cut them off early, smile them off so good
