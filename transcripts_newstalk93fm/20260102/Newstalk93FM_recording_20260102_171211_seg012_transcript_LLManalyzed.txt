20260102 171211 I go jump like I never jump, wave like I never wave, bind like I never wind before, just to show you I'm sorry, I'm sorry, and I need you back in my life. You got people by the truck, emotions running high. We are not in the sky, tears running down we eye. Can't you tell that we sorry, we sorry, and we need you back in we eye. I need you come on to me. Come on to me, come on to me Come on to me I promise I won't cry First time I touch this stage This make me feel awake I want to touch this stage Promise I won't cry
