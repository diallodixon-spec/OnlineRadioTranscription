20260102 120706 I barely could concentrate I feel a sugar rush in my vein One cup it does make my day I'm missing it, we're not gonna love, oh yeah Eat me up Only you alone can bring fire back in the soul Eat me up Girl, you are that thing I could never leave you alone, no And no matter what they go say I hold in your clothes I could never let you go Miss Oshiney Girl, I'm coming home and I'll see you again. All day, through the night, I'm dreaming. Yeah. Miss Osine. When you turn it up, make it smooth, my darling. When outside, it's pouring rain.
