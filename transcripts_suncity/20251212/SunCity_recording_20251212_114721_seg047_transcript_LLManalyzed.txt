20251212 114721 Sikha! I'm looking at suffering over and over I'm a life, I'm Azuli Automaterial Possession Take a chimen ghost and I'm here Looking at my life, I knew we'd find hope Ever since I met that guy that's so good I know no funny, do no fine joke This line is like a quicksand, I'ma go define you I'm using it myself. Life's rough but I'm not trying to go up. I'm a giant drone and I'm not really used to kill me. Yes, but man, I'm high hope. Bust a cage in my hand, touch the stage and sing to my note. I go high for the family. Them rock my boat. Probably their celebration life.
