20251231 112624 So, whilst we have the positive news with the murder rate, we still can't get control of what's happening on our roads. Up until December 30th, so that's yesterday, Jamaica has seen an uptick in road fatalities. 373 people died from 324 fatal collisions, which is a 3% increase on 2024. And the Director General of the Road Traffic Island Authority, Daniel Price, says in response to the increase, the agency plans to expand public education. You know, yeah, that's great, but I don't think you needed an increase in order to continue to have that public awareness drive. No, no, no. That should have been something that has been in place and we also need to improve.
