Waiting for the good Lord to pass my way Oh, yeah I'll live down by the river Singing songs of joy on this lovely day Oh, yeah Time gets in order Still we striving for better And we not gonna stop till the battery's worn And we get just this Cause if you lose your stand anyone will try to push you over over and over lift up your head and hold it up high
