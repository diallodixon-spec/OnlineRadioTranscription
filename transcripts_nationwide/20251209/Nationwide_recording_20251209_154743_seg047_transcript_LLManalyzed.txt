And I must tell you, Kareem and Honey, he moved under some trees and had to move some poles out of the road. We really went to find the people where they were. Well, we're happy that you did, and it's great that you did the research and tried to find those communities really impacted, because that's one of the things that we encounter when we go down there as well especially further from the center of these parishes you find people in places it's hard to reach you know so we commend you guys now can you tell us a little bit about your emergency packages 2000 what include what did you include in them
