20251225 093923 Looking back across the years I can see beyond the tears And thank you, thank you Thank you for the, thank you for the times you said no Thank you for the doors that you closed All the ways you never let me go And the things you never gave me so many times I didn't understand I wouldn't let you take my hand but now I wanna fall at your feet and thank you for all the things you've ever gave me too many times I didn't understand
