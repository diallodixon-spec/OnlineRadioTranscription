20251215 184641 Thank you for staying with us. We move now into a mini interview segment on today's show. And we have a very special guest, indeed, the National Association of Volunteers in Sports officially launched its National Volunteer Initiative. And to tell us all about that and more, it's time to welcome to the show, founder, Ms. Renee Byfield, one of the founding members. We can cut nuts, we can use the Aquamate name here. But good evening to you and everybody. Welcome to Power Play. My name is Keith Williams. Hi, Mr. Williams. How are you? It's my pleasure to be here and represent the NAFTA.
