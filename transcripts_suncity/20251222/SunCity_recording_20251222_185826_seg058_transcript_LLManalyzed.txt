20251222 185826 Oh, Smith City is so hot! Where's my umbrella? You hear a new sign, you dance a lick In your hand, in your dick, in your rock, in your dick Move to the drum and make it on the tip Step forward and come up back Add us a new style, we're the one place to do Rap, move, we'll dance to music, sweet girl Move, we'll all round the place, night and day We'll say just move and dance, on my way to the place, to the place We can still remember all the hell I ever spent I wanna give nothing but something holding my mind When I needed information, when the night was over Yo, how do you watch? Thank you for watching.
