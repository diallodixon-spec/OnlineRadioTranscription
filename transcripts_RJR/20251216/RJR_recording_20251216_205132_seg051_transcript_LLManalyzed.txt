But yeah, and once the abscess is drained of the pus, then it can actually heal. I don't know if you've ever had anywhere that ever fester, Mrs.. You ever have anywhere fester anybody? I had some festering infections before when I was younger, when I was a child. I remember on a couple occasions on my leg. And that's why they say my leg fussy fussy.
