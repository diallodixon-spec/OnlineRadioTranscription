20251215 190810 How do you do that? What would be your advice from your portfolio at a federal level anyway? Yeah, well, I think, you know, they had a national cabinet meeting yesterday and they talked about gun law reform. Well, where was the questions about resourcing to prevent this sort of thing from happening? Those reports around under resourcing in the AFP talked about a case officer monitoring 20 or 30 people of interest. There is no way an individual can stay on top of a workload like that. So the government who downgraded their counter-terror unit within the AFP have this report from the AFP saying we don't have enough resources, May of 2024, against the backdrop of ASIO saying our probable terror threat level is up to probable. That is a government that is asleep at the wheel and not taking these issues seriously. And on top of that, you don't deal with Gillian Seagal's report on tackling antisemitism. What about the authorities? We have to close now before we move on. I mean, ASIO was aware of this guy, or these guys.
