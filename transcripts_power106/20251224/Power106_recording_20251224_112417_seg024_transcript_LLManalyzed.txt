20251224 112417 So this is from Jacksonville wanted me to read this while you were here. The JLP government cares not one iota about any imbalance in trade against Jamaica. Take the production of onions in St. Thomas as an example. It's mostly grown by women who not only expend the little capital they have, I didn't know this, but also do the back-breaking work with a fork and a machete and so on. And yet this government gives one of their members from Centarn. I don't know if it's so, because when you talk about who owns this, that and the other, then it might be easy for someone. I don't know. But you say that they give this person a license to import onions. This might look insignificant, but it is these little bits that add up over time.
