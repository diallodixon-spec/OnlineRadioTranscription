20251229 195828 It's Rewind Monday, but it's the theme of the year. Rewind Monday from the Star City, one of your points. You can't be alone. Your radio will continue. You can leave me there, with you I'll always share. Because when the sun shine, we shine together. Told you I'll be here forever. Said I'll always be your friend. So we know time will stick it out to the end. Now that it's raining more than ever, I know that we'll still have each other. Stand under my arm, boy, love. You can part of my entity. Yeah, for infinity. When the world has struck its part, when the world has struck it's part, the hand is hard to get the momentum up. Because when the sun is shining and you're with us, we'll be here forever.
