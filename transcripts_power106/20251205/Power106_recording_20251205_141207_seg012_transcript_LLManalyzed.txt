============================================================

volunteer day for economic and social development. One of two United Nations special celebrations today, the other being World Soil Day. We'll pay some attention to these days in just a bit. Right after we tell you that it is Friday, December 5, 2025, the 339th day of the year in the Gregorian calendar. Only 26 days remain until the end of 2025. We greet you well wherever in the world you are listening to us right now, as we remain eternally grateful for the gift of life and the privilege to serve you. On yet another edition of your program, both sides of the story, we don't ever take your listenership for granted. It is a perfectly competitive NIDA landscape in 21st century Jamaica.
