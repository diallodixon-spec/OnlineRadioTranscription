20251217 161009 DJ Jerome The Shell Boss Know what time it is We came here to party We came here to dance You know that you're my girl Damn right I'm your man This night going too good Don't fall for the games But he said she said dumb I got a whole lot of names And a whole lot of numbers But I throw them away Cause I think I might love you Could be the Mary Jane Or the spell that I'm under But I got, I got I got I got options You the, you the, you the you the top one So baby, baby if it ain't problem Can I get someone your love? Been around the game Been around the fame Been around the money
