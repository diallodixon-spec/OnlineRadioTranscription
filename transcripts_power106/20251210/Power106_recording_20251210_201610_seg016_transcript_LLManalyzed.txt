Welcome back. Welcome back to Pouring Your Health here on Power 106 FM. I'm Dr. Jackie Campbell. Now today, the 10th of December, 2025, is being recognized as International Human Rights Day. This is an annual event that commemorates the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights by the United Nations General Assembly on December the 10th, 1948. Tonight, we will turn the spotlight on one aspect of human rights, that is as it relates to health. Joining us is constitutional lawyer, Dr. The Honorable Lloyd Barnett. Good evening, Dr. Barnett.
