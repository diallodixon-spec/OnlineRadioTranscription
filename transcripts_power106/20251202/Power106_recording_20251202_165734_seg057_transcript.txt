And set your mind at ease There comes a point in your life You gotta let it go Listen to me, let it go Stop worrying, stressing, please just take it slow Release your heart and set your mind at ease There comes a point in your life you gotta let it go You gotta let it go, Let it go Say why do you wait, stop worrying When you could be spending more time planning You're like a car driving in a wall Before you stare it out, you start crying
