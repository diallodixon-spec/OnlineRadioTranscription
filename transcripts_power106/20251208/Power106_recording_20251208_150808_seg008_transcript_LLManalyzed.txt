Is there a difference in the processes between buying an existing host versus buying into a new development? When you're buying in a development, it's pretty much the same process, but as many of you may know, when it comes to developments in Jamaica, the process is long go. That is the main difference. Let's say the house already exists. Say you're getting a mortgage three to four months. If it's a cash transaction, typically 36 days or whatever you negotiate with the seller. When it comes to a development, it could take several months, sometimes even several years. So that is the main difference. With a development too, because the properties or the buildings usually aren't yet completed.
