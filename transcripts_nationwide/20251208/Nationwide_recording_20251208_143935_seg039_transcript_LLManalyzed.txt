Feel sick all the way up on the mountain So I show my pain, it ain't half okay With all of my flaws, me still go down These are the sad parts of the process Wait, yeah, I'm far from perfect Her people close to me, we don't deserve it And I've never feel me so poverty Life full of lessons and me still a learner Yeah, me make enough mistakes, now well Just last week me touch with best friend girl Wish the hands of time could turn And all the bad memories would burn Yo Jah, you been a perfect me G I have a girl where woulda do anything for me And me still find me self out a road a cheat With a girl where if me sick would now why you sue me me? Messed up in the visual, wish me coulda talked to God but me no spiritual, get one leap of love but feelings no reciprocal, there a mystery inside it just no visual Feels like I'm way up on a mountain, wash up my pain in a fountain
