The system might not proper But we love the vibe, the food and the culture Whoa, can't you see the beauty of this country? Me never know a serious thing Until me rich and foreign Say what a nice place we live Sweet jam down, the only problem is Dollar's not run, so what a nice place we live. Sweet jam down, the only problem is. Dollars not run, no with the money in your pocket, and no God in your heart. Grow down people, what more you want? Reggae music, a player, reggae artist, a chart. You saw me burn, I'm in a transplant. What a nice place to live, sweet jam down here. Only problem is, dollars not run. Say what a nice place to leave, sweet jam down there. Only problem is dollars not run. A man will live on a banana boat and him gone overbroad. Because him say every way better than here. But when him touch certain country, see the system.
