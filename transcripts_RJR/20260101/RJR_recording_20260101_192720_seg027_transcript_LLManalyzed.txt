20260101 192720 But I know what I've seen Tried my best, that love and friendship But all that is passed and gone This little boy is moving on Sitting here in limbo Waiting for the tide to flow Sitting here in Limbo Thank you folks, I gotta go. Trust you had a great time. It certainly was a pleasure keeping you company. And I hope the surfing was all you needed.
