============================================================

I thought it over, now I realize That it's never over, only satisfied Oh it's you, sweet baby I don't wanna be free from your embrace Sweet baby, only hoping it's not too late to try Oh yeah, it's you Sweet baby I know I wasn't captured by your smile Sweet baby I just wanna be right there by your side Right by your side Lying here alone, I'm dreaming My mind's wandering, my thoughts are lonely Looking through the memories in my mind How a love so real could come so empty, I just keep wondering why Will I ever find the love we shared together, you and I?
