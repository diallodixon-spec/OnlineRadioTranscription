I will be strong, I will be faithful Cause I'm counting on a new beginning A reason for living, a deeper meaning, yeah I wanna stand with you on a mountain I wanna bathe with you in the sea I wanna lay like this forever Until the sky falls down on me Oh, oh, oh, oh. Oh, oh, ooh, ooh. Oh, ooh, oh, ooh. Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh. Oh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh.
