20251219 171108 When you hear the stomachs growl and do what Daniel did Call up to your father like a little kid Tell him that they're big and you just heard one roar Then get up and use your faith to block the door When the birds stop flying, they'll understand Never throw over line in the dead with a praying man Go pray, Daniel, pray. That's the way of making through. Come on, pray, Daniel. Pray. Don't you let the devil get the best of you. Your troubles aren't as bad as you thought they were. You can tell my lie and your prayer be heard Your fate is gonna have them eaten right out of your hand Never throw a red line in the dead with a praying man
