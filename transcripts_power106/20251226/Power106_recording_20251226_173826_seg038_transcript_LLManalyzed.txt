20251226 173826 Are you ready? Are you ready? When the rollers call out I'll be standing tall up To face the darkest and the hardest of times We'll be taking care of all the children thereof But if it's required we'll be on the front line You can call me by my name I am ready to roll Once the rules remain the same How now the story's been told. Call me anytime, never pop out. Loyalness is on the rise, don't you ever I've doubted. Never say never will you come.
