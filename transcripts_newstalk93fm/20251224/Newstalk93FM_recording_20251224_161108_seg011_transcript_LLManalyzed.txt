20251224 161108 This is my apology. Follow me. Come and see what you mean to all of me. You're a treasure in my eyes, the greatest pleasure in my life. Cause when you're living better than me, honesty, I will please, home is where the heart should be. Pretty feathers in disguise disguise Not together we will rise So don't you ever let me down again Cause I'm depending on you So you better come through this time Please hear my crying
