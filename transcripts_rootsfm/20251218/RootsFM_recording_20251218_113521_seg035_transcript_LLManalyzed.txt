20251218 113521 We heard that we win $10 million and we're not buying anything. We have not purchased no ticket. So we ourselves are scammers too. Because there's no way on earth you're going to give, I'm going to give you my account number to put money in it because you said I won $10 million. From what? I didn't enter anything. You're going to tell me that I won 10 million because the ticket that I purchased unknowingly to myself. And I'm not suffering from anything. I didn't purchase anything. Well, you send the account, you send, so the first thing they start to tell you, then to send the money, the 10 million to you, you have to come up up with 50,000 and then you come up with a $50,000 because you want to collect the 10 million if you look at it you know you have contribute also so that's scamming
