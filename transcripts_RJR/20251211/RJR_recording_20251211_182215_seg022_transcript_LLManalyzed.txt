Even though I don't think that's going to happen, or at the end of the day, JPS could still keep their license and you just change the terms. I think that's best case scenario. And I think that's probably what the government wants. But I also think, to Mr. Paul's point, I think that the government might not want to listen to the opposition because they want to do it themselves. Would it be fair to say that Melissa actually ended up putting JPS in a stronger position in relation to the extension of the license? Possibly, because now the position that it has put them in has given them an additional bargaining chip to say, well, we can't get funding with this in place, so you need to decide. And it might have strong-armed the government into actually giving them the loan.
