20251231 185740 I know the answer to this question in that part of the FIFA sports medical exam that I'm doing right now. Women have more ACL damage and knee damage than men. There was like a million and something people playing football and even the referees we have to be doing data on so coming back from an injury that there are instances where women are being injured more than men men yeah yeah yeah you have more football injuries to women leg and below the knee, latter ASL, and poor men is concerned, and such. A minute ago here now, what's the message out there, Dr. Young, in particular, in terms of taking these things seriously?
