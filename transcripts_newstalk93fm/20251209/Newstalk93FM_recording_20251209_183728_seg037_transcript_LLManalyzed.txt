At one way, they don't want me in their front seat They don't want me cause at you one way They don't want in their front seat I ain't no less than nothing to say Every fast I draw, jumping up Doing what I want, jumping up Tell them I ain't leaving, right they are sleeping Every fast I draw jumping up, doing what I want Jumping up, tell them are you leaving Right they are sleeping You're listening to Sleek Radio, 93 FM. I am blessed, I am blessed Every day of my life, I am blessed When I wake up in the morning And I lay my head to rest, every day of my life
