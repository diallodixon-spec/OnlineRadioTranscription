20251222 161909 Dear Nula, you mustn't have received my last letter when you were sending us the four calling boards. There was pandemonium in the pear tree again last night, and the vet's bill was £32. The mother is on sedation as I write. I know you meant no harm. And remain your close friend, Govenant. Day five. Nula, your generosity knows no bounds. Five gold rings! When the parcel arrived, I was scared stiff that it might be more birds, because the smell in the living room is atrocious. However, I don't want to seem ungrateful for the beautiful rings. Your affectionate friend, Gov'net. Day six. Nula, what are you trying to do to us? It isn't that we don't appreciate your generosity, but the six geese have not alone nearly murdered the callan birds, but they laid their eggs on top of the vets head from the pear tree and his bill was sixty-eight pound in cash. My mother is munching sixty grains of valium a day and talking to herself in a most alarming way.
