============================================================

Our XG was off the charts in terms of our expected goals. There's still some things that we need to work on that maybe to the common eye we wouldn't be able to see. But overall, we just went out there and played a really good match and just got the job done. The thing about going against this, we are always thinking about what if the opponent were infinitely better? What would happen? But my main problem was that I sometimes did not get the chance to make a point. It's an easy victory score. Don't give us such a chance to make certain points. Yeah, exactly. I think, look, you know, when you go through or you play matches like that, you know, it's quite easy to be complacent. And, you know, there was times in the match where I think we took it natural.
