20251230 182610 You can last all night, don't get too excited Oh, privacy You ain't got to go nowhere, you can stay inside Can you blow my mind? Set off my whole body If I give you my time Can you stretch my soul from it? I don't wanna wait Come take it, take me where I ain't been before Can you blow my breath, make me water, make me sweat. Make me hotter. Make me lose my breath.
