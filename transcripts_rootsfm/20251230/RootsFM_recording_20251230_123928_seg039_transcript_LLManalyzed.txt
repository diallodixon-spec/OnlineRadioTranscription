20251230 123928 Residents of Rose Heights in Montego Bay staged another protest yesterday over the continued lack of water in sections of the community. The protesters blocked 41 Boulevard, the main road leading into the area, using debris as they voiced frustration over what they described as months without a regular water supply. Some residents said the problem existed even before Hurricane Melissa and has worsened since. Residents complained that despite receiving water bills, their pipes have remained dry for extended periods. This was the second protest in less than a week, with demonstrators insisting they will continue until the issue is addressed. Councillor for Montego Bay Southeast Division Arthur Lynch said he is aware of the situation and understands the residents frustration. He explained that the National Water Commission had planned to enter the community
