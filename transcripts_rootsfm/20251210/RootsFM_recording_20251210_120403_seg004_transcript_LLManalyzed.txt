============================================================

I ask you, Lord, for divine protection over these men today. Guard them from harm, physically, emotionally, and spiritually. Let your angels surround them in every step they take. Keep them safe from danger, from deceit, from distraction, and give them wisdom to walk in your way. Cover their mind with peace and cover their path with your purpose. Father, we know that many are the plans in the hearts of a person, but it is you, O Lord, and your purpose that prevails. I pray this moment, Lord, that every man would walk confidently in the purpose you have placed on his life.
