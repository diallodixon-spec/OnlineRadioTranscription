You're a treasure in my eyes The greatest pleasure in my life Cause when you're living by the knee Honesty, hurry please Who makes whether I should be? Pretty feathers in disguise Not to give up we will rise So don't you ever Let me down again Cause I'm depending on you So you better come through this time Please hear my cry and if I ever Let you down my friend
