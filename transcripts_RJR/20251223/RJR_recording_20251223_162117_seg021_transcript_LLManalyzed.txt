20251223 162117 I get to my barn daddy me know a pain Mami me happy than when the clothes stain The money not change not know the gold chain Heart a love for me better than with no roll tape Fight down with fire cause me not chew on flame Ambition with pride of me make her full of shame Still down to earth all when me take the most plane I found one for me dirt dog so me no play the post game Sounds from me heart so dem africaness Yeah the way I walk through the valley of death And if they take everything and all be half of my breath Man up the same way, don't know what I just Life over everything, nothing like life Life over everything nothing like life Wish me coulda live again, something like Christ Nothing like life, nothing like life Life are the ultimate, yeah Me sad that you no hold me yet, no Only if I trust me get on Father, you never let go
