20251217 092513 chapter 1 verse 10 so she said that he didn't he says that we should be forgiving but she said however he did not forgive in that chapter so why why I don't know if you can say briefly why he didn't why you do know God gives man the opportunity to turn God gives man the opportunities to turn and when we say God doesn't forgive, when God is forgiven us already for in this time, like in the case of Obadiah, I mean, in case of Esau, I need to read that because you've caught me off guard. I can't even find it.
