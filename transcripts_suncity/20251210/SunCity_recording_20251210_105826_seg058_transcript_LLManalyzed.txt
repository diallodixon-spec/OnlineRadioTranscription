I said, don't worry, my people, don't you ever forget. No, no, no, no. You've got the glory with every single breath that you take, no. Don't worry, your people, don't ever forget. Na, na, na. Give joy to glory with every single step that you take now. I say don't worry, my people, don't you ever forget, whoa. You've got the glory, with every single breath that you take, now. Hiding at the mountain Oh yes I know Deeper than the river Oh yes I know Whiter than the valley
