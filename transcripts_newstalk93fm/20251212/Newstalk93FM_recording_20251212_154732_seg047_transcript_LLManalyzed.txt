20251212 154732 Oh, Lord. Oh, Lord. How them, Kabaka, lyrical champion. Watch me chop up the rhythm like a sword from Japan. So bright and full swing like a real Chinese man. Practitioner of yoga but not Indian. Lyrics them a weapon of mass destruction. I have nuclear bomb like an American. Can't overstand like an Egyptian. I'm a glyphic when I shift it to the fifth dimension. And the rhythm not to fit my religion. You get twist up and flat up like a Brazilian. Pile off your face with the mic in my hand. Then I sip a cup of tea like I come from England.
