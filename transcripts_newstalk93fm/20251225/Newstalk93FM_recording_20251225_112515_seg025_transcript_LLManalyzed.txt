20251225 112515 So I pressed up the top, that's quite fine to me. Sitting under the this light Listening to music that's alive It's gonna be a good day It's gonna be, it's gonna be, a good day When you started my life Me, your watch, we're eating on my side Outfit, take care of me and mine No off, no times, and no cross-cast fire. No, no. It's how we move. Just the way I'm gonna move. Gonna make me rock and move. Boy, no, no. I'm just how we move.
