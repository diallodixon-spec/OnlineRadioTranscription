20251216 212718 I was being tested, my blessing, my blessing. I thought I wouldn't make it without being tested. My blessing, they blessing, they blessing. Gotta protect, gotta protect, my blessing. My blessing, gotta protect, gotta protect up your heart, high up, sail it like a bird, like a fire. Burn it up, burn, burn it up, burn. Bless up, step up, a full military. Send them a wish of mine, but that's not necessary. Every day you say're bright, you're nothing ordinary Bless I'm protecting from the whole, holy sanctuary Every people only want to see you dead and buried Have a leap in life, we say I'm the Almighty, bless me I'm ready to find the truth
