20251223 114426 It's a beautiful day So yeah, go I walk through the valleys of the shadows of death I will fear no evil won't be dismayed when I see the clock ticking away and things are not in place. Everything in life happens for a reason. Disappointment comes with a lesson. It's for me to get wiser, got to work harder. In the end end it will get better thank you for sunshine thank you for rain thank you for joy thank you for pain it's a beautiful day it's a beautiful
