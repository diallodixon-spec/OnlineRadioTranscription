Me never walk on an old man's land. I know my God, I know my man's love. I hear me dad, I know my love. Why didn't I pay the foolish act back? I learned my lesson like a good old child. If I did, I'd be living in style. Good Lord, if heaven knows, I wasn't born to walk. Yeah, I know me God, I know man's love. We never walk on our own, man's love.
