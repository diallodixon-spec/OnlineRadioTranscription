20251212 113722 But we not give up. Darkness cover up the whole island, but every heart still a beat strong. People come together in a one accord, share a little food, share the yard. Even when the tears them full of we eyes, we look to tomorrow, we still arise. House blow down in the souls there. We step by step till we find a way. Neighbors help neighbor hand to hand cause love stronger than any storm we land. We plant back the garden and mend the gate. We hold the faith because God never late. But we not give up. You know the ashes hope still grow. We turn the sorrows into tomorrow.
