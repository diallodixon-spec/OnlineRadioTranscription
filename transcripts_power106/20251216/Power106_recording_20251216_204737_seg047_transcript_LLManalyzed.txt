20251216 204737 Lord knows we're not getting anywhere. Seems we're always blowing wherever we've got going. And it seems at times with all we've got, we haven't got a break. Just once, can we figure out what we keep doing wrong. Why the good times never last for long. Where are we going wrong? Just once can we find a way to find the meaning of life To make the magic last for more than just one night
