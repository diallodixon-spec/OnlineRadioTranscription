20251215 214921 A dance floor empty and pimp's feet On a mission for them greens Leave me money making machines serving fiends I've been in the game for ten years making rap tunes Ever since honey was wearing Sassoon Now it's 95 and they clock me and watch me diamond shining Looking like I robbed Liberace It's all good from Diego to the fakes Your city is the prime and your city making fame On the floor, my fingers, your new sign, waiting for you in the LBC, it's kind of hard to be a Snoopy on Double G, but somehow, someway, This is Eminem and you're listening to the sounds of Shoddy Shane. Yeah!
