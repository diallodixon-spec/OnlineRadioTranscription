20251215 141006 I'm talking to all pagan boys and girls. And all me drop the melody closer than tender. Can't sleep at night, them all are worried and fed. As you still all say I'm a type of disrespect. Don't get the warning, this is the check. Nice in my back and all the waltz. If enough of them bring up them gays and all the wrinkle and the vex. So they know we're not corrupts and the prophet ain't go step. I stop tell the woman bout her under them dress. Stop tell them bout them hip and tell them bout them breasts. I don't know what all of me princess possess.
