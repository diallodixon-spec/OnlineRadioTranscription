20251212 190103 targets requirements order 2025 and resolution permitting the temporary suspension of the fiscal rules for an initial period ending March 31, 2027. This follows the recent approval of a similar order in the House of Representatives last week. This move is being pursued as part of efforts to mitigate the impact of Hurricane Melissa on the economy. The fiscal impact is estimated at 5.3% of GDP between fiscal year 2025-26 to fiscal year 2029-30, well above the legislative threshold of 1.5% to trigger suspension of the fiscal rules. Making his contribution to the debate on the order and resolution in the Senate recently, Parliamentary Secretary in the Ministry of Education, Skills, Youth and Information, Senator Marlon Morgan, indicated that the government will exercise fiscal discipline and responsible governance in managing the nation's affairs, ensuring a stronger, more resilient recovery from Hurricane Melissa.
