20260102 124426 does corruption keep Jamaica as number one, not two, says Simone. Church should not collect my tax money. They don't pay tax. Why, the PM did not allocate the money to the MPs to help the community. Mr. Earl, you sound like you own a church, Simone. I don't own church. But I do believe that nothing is wrong with the allocation that the Prime Minister has spoken of. The church is an important asset when it comes to the whole matter of the reconstruction and recovery that is necessary in the country. So I support that initiative that was raised by the PM and think it's a great idea. The only thing is that the 75 million, I think it's a drop in the bucket. It's not enough.
