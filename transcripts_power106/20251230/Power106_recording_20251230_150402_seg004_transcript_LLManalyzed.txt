20251230 150402 Lisa, it is so good to see you. But sorry you catch me like this, girl. My uncle said one by one, when my family go for clarity, you don't want to hear the price of the people they put on or something. But matters are worse, me hear say half of the thing they're missing, and me know say a customs. Girl, how you know say a customs? Lisa, stop going like you're not having a sense, man. You know say everybody will talk about it in the media. You know, one of us stop here sir, have you ever experienced that? Customs don't go into your package, suitcase, barrel or cargo unless you ship the item or the agent stand up right there when they inspect it. Listen, customs job is to protect the borders, collect revenue and to facilitate trade. They don't collect or store shipment, they inspect it and somebody offers to present it for inspection. So how customers ever get so much cost in them? Tracy, and the customers are alone involved in the clearance process even though it's them we tend to talk about.
