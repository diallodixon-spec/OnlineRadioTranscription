20251218 091812 ham for my people here in West Milan. So thank you so much Megamart and Gazanazan for contributing the hams that have been baked for the people of Grange and the surrounding communities. I've also brought two lovely Christmas puddings that I baked to serve the people here in Western Jamaica. Thank you for Mac Tours who took us down in style. We left Kingston listeners a little bit after three this morning. And it was a very long journey, but beautiful despite the devastation. So thanks so much to Andrew McCreith, the owner of Mac Tours Jamaica and our driver, Mr. Audley Reed, who transported some of us down here. Nurse Nunes for providing some articles of clothing and for a whopping $500,000 contribution towards the relief and restoration we thank
