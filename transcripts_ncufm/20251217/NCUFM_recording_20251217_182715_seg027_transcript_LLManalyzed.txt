20251217 182715 prayer in you that healing is taking place that you I pray that you would have entered your season of healing because according to this scripture that I have in front of me it says to everything there is a season and a time to every purpose under the heavens because even after the storm storm, God brings a new season. So hold on to hope, grow through the change and let your light shine wherever you are. Drive Time Family, it's really been a pleasure having you here on the bus for Philly Wednesday where we have enjoyed some local music.
