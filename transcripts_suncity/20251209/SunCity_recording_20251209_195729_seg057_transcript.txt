So tell me, tell me, where you got it from? They don't know code. They them your money when they want it Never knew bad men could be like this Never knew some people so easy to switch Anytime I see them here I take From them things are just them ferrets I'm not kidding, I never depend on them I go leave at night cause I'm in the bed when they write me off And I laugh, I have some brand new things on the wall But, but when dem see me na me Dior and me LV, dem a talk about how me show off. But when they preach, when they preach, some boy a truce like them stoop and be, when they preach when they preach, and me ain't me self, na boy no hype me.
