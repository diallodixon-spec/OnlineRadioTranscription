20251219 121614 It's two completely different things. I can imagine. Having gone down there twice, we went there twice to distribute items. I said, Lord, I want to do more. I'm not content with what we would have done. I feel like it's a drop in the bucket. Yes. And I wanted to do more. What should I do? And I heard the voice of the Lord. Clearly, the Lord said, use what I gave you. I said, God, what does that mean? And he said it again, use what I gave you and it reminds me of when the story in the Bible talks about what Moses had in his hand, which was a rod. And I said, well, okay, God, I think what you're leading me now to is obviously a concert you want us to sing. You want me to be able to use my, you know, event planning skills to go ahead and execute a benefit concert. And with that, I said, OK, God, I'm going to be obedient. So it came from just wanting to do more, asking God what that more should look like. And then hearing from the Lord, I now decided to give him my yes and to move forward in obedience. Beautiful. Glad, glad to hear that.
