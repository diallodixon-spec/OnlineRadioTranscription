Oh, yeah. Can't seem to get no rest at night. Thinking how you make me feel so right. Well, I've never passed the chance to make you mine. You're so fine. Yes, you are. Out of all the things that I could dream of. Dream of. You're the one that I always think of. Think of. I hope you will accept my gift of love, if that's enough. I hope it is. She has a wheel looking into my eyes.
