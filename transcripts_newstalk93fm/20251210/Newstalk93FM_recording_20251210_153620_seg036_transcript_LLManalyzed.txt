Oh, you want my car now? I don't need a rich to somebody that can make me feel safe. Yeah. Look, I don't want a couple, but nobody ever made me feel safe like you. Because when I'm with you, I just know I'm fine. You take all the pressure off my mind all the time. Patient in time will not be going out my mind. Say from the problems. I don you know that I'm that right you got a girl that Wanna hear right when I pass and I crash you and go dip right? That's when I need you to move. That's how I get right. Baby, if I'm safe, it runs out the safe. Save like the money let it sit up in the bank. Save like the cold.
