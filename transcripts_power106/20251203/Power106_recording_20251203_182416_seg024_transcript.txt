============================================================

I can't see a player this side who can match her, to be honest with you. Now then, very good, thanks for that. Now then, coming up, Nicaragua, Antigua, Barbuda, Guyana up next for the reggae girls. What are your thoughts? Have you been monitoring the program sufficiently to speak about it? No, but I've seen the games coming up and I don't think the teams are that much different from they were before. I still think we have the opportunity of going all the way to the World Cup again because we have a good squad. And even the last game we played, it was not our full squad. There are still players out that, you know, I think will come into the squad. So I still think they have a great chance of making it to the World Cup. But these Nicaragua and all these teams coming up, they will give us a good fight, but I still think that we will win these games and make it all the way through. Let's hope that the program is not hijacked by stupidity.
