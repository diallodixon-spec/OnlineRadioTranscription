20251217 181007 Tracy? Hey, girl, what's up? So hold on. Why you look so vexed this early? They ain't had just talked. Girl, how do you not see a customs? At least stop going like you don't have any sense. You don't see everybody talking about it in the media. You don't have to stop listening to me. Have you ever experienced that? Customs don't go into your package, suitcase, barrel or cargo unless you ship the item or the agent stand up right when they might inspect it. Listen, customs job is to protect the borders, collect revenue and to facilitate trade. Them not collect or store shipment, them inspect it and somebody off represent it for inspection. So how customs ever get so much custom then?
