20251217 144030 There is a history of cancer, period. So it's always best to check, gentlemen, if there is somebody, even if it's a female in your family, that's had a diagnosis or has survived it, or is a warrior, please go and check it. You said something interesting, that in terms of the age group, if you have not been told that you have high blood pressure or any of those things. And I wanted to signal that, because some people some people think as a man you're not going to have high blood pressure unless you're 60 and over and that diabetes and and other ncds are really for people past 50 and over but it is possible as a young man if if you are not in the best of health to to have those issues absolutely and these days we are actually finding that the average age that people are coming down with these illnesses are much less. You know, so it's not the 65 year old anymore, it's not necessarily the 50 year old anymore. I have 30 year old patients with high blood pressure, with high cholesterol.
