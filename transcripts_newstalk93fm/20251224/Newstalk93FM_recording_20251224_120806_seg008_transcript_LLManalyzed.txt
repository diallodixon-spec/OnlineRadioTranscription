20251224 120806 All day, through the night, I dreamin', yeah. Where you turn it up, make it smooth, my darling. When outside is pouring rain, say put a button on the fire. Raise the temperature higher. Make the thing catch your fire. All over the counter, yeah, me feel sweet Ice the cocoa tea, use the sugar And together we are complete, darling We are the island, I'll tell you what's good. I'm a boy, I'm a girl. Tell you what's good, I'm a boy. So pray for me, ride or come home with me.
