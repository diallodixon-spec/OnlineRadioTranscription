I don't need a present or a flowing train When I've got you right here with me Always beside me, never too far You are my Christmas I don't need the second or the final place Cause I appear to put a smile on my face We have each other like the moon and the stars You are my Christmas, yes what if I wasn't sure that this gentleman is back I'm sure today Because it's a Christmas day and I'm looking across and I'm seeing DJ Deli. Good afternoon DJ Deli, how you doing sir? Merry Christmas! Father Christmas is here people! We got Father Christmas in the house, how you doing my brother, you good? Not bad, not bad, not bad. Yes man, and this Christmas, beautiful Christmas day. Yeah man, a beautiful start to a wonderful day.
