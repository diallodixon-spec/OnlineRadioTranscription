20251215 211810 I don't know for what, but we will dance and stop until the sun gets up. Can't stop the crew, all them have is just about a mouth chat. Ravers will dance and stop, until we reach the top. In a Jamaica, we dance all nice. All dancers are we believers. Everybody catch this new dance Come catch this new dance Everybody not dancing me now Everybody buss a dancing me now
