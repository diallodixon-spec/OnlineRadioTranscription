20251225 155527 I don't mean to waste your time But I can't listen to the crowd With situations in my life Telling me to keep it down But I need you I know I'm wrong, but you can heal me Jesus, I'm calling you I might not be worth it, but you know I'm willing Jesus, you made me I know that I'm'm broken but I heard you can heal me Jesus said I'm calling you People say I'm worthless but I'll sell you if you let me
