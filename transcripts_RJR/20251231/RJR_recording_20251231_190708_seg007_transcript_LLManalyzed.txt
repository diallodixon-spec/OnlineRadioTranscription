20251231 190708 where I'm from, goes with me everywhere. And lots of people say, Marlon, you know, you're a politician and you're always smiling, you're always giving jokes, you're always, you know, lightening up the room. And really and truly, life is so short. You know, my friend Ramel died when I was a teenager and it changed my life. That's when I knew from Jamaica, when I was growing up, that life is fragile. And so, you know, in life we should not be pretentious, we should not pretend to be somebody else, we should be our authentic selves. And so, this is why I'm always so friendly, so nice, so cultural. And you know what? Whenever I speak, patwa comes out. It's broken English. It is with an accent. And so people just love it. And so that's what Tamra gets from me.
