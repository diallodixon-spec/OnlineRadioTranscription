20251224 165633 Day twelve. Listen, slurry head, you have ruined our lives. The twelve maidens dancing turned up last night and beat the living daylights out of the eight maids of Milken because they found them carrying on with the eleven lords of Leapin. Meanwhile the swans got out of the living room where they'd been hiding since the big battle and savaged hell out with the lords and all the maids. There were eight ambulances here last night and the local civil defence as well. The mother is in a home for the bewildered and I'm sitting here up to me neck in bird's droppings, empty whisky and valium bottles, bird's blood and feathers, where the flaming cows eat the leaves off the pear you, I'm a broken man. Kenneth, it's really been a great afternoon. Thank you so much, sir. Christmas Eve. Yeah. Yes. I hope you get a chance. I feel like, oh, I've got a conscience still. I hope you'll get a chance to do that.
