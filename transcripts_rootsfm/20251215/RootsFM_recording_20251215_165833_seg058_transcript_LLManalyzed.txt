20251215 165833 It's stepping out on your own, got a heart made of stone, such a cold, cold girl. Hey, and what will my story be? Is there a future for me Inside your cold, cold world Well I heard but I could not believe it You were out all night on the town I would call you from home alone And you were nowhere around I would wait like a child on this birthday All of my waiting was in vain The world is changing and so should you.
