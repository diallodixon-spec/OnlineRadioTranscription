============================================================

I don't see no help on the floor. Whenever I go out with you, I find out something new. You're a fake, baby. You can't conceal it. Know how I know, cause I can feel it. You're a fake, baby, know I have more reason, cause in your mind, it's lying season. You have the light, but not the blue, and those false eyelashes that you're willing to wear. If it hurts this morning, you call call me Clyde. I'll experience the pain that I go by. If women could be born again, then you'd be it. You're amazing, baby.
