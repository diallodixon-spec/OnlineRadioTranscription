20251215 114430 This one says, good afternoon sir, one month now since the hurricane and no help for anybody. I am in Williamsfield, St. Elizabeth. Food come, but we only got one house in Williamsfield and they give to their supporters only. I'm calling Mr. Greed and Mr. Sangsor to look into this. This one says good morning. Can you please say why NWC is pressuring us the customers a bill due on November 8th paid by checks on November 7th they say I must put put in a drop box and come back for receipt another day NWC charged late payment fee but hold on oh so you're saying if you pay by cheque and put it in a drop box but if they only reconcile the following day they're saying going to late payment fee you know situation
