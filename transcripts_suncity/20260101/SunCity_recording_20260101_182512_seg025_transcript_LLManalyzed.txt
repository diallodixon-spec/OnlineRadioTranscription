20260101 182512 Living two lives just ain't easy at all But we're gonna hang Runnin' there, oh Secret love for us again That's what we are Trying so hard to hide the way we feel Cause we both belong to someone else But we can't let go Cause what we feel is all so real So real, so real You and me, are we fair? Is this good, or do we care?
