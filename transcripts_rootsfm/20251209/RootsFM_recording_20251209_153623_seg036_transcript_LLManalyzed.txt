For my love keeps growing stronger A little more time to save But in my head, I love someplace Just a little bit longer, baby For my love keeps growin' stronger A little time to save but in my head I love someplace For you and me me. Oh, there's a place in your heart that remembers the good from the start. Just put me back where I belong. You waste some time to clear your mind. I stayed away for months without you touching up.
