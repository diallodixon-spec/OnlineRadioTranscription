20251231 163014 I can't believe you really and truly have people believe that Columbus discovered Jamaica. I can't believe someone really and truly believes that they captured slaves and brought to Jamaica. They weren't slaves over there in Africa. They were free people. They captured people and turned them into slaves. Don't need to rewrite history, you know. No one to deal with, you know. Anyways, time is now 4.31 p.m. Gonna head into the break after the break. More reggae music on the flip side. Please continue to keep it locked to Sun City with me, Sun Jack Alipatch Patch soon forward.
