My Anilou My Anilou, my Anilou Anilou Jamaican fruitcake mix Just add eggs and butter and pop it to the oven Saving time to create beautiful moments with your loved ones Anilou, creating memories The fireplace is burning bright Shining all on me I see the presence underneath The good old Christmas tree And I mom and daddy share a kiss under the mistletoe And we'll cherish all these simple things wherever we may be, oh why? Cause that's Christmas to me I've got this Christmas song in my heart
