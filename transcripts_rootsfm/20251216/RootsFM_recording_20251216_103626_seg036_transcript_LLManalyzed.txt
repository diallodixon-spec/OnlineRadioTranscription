Well, if you are not affected, please ask your community to donate to the Creative Resilience Fund. It's on the American Friends of Jamaica site. It's pinned on our Instagram page. There's a link there where you can go and donate, especially for people from overseas. They donate to the African Friends of Jamaica and those funds are sent to us. Secondly, so encourage your community to donate, especially Diaspora. And then secondly, creatives who are here who have been affected should go on www.kingstoncreative.org and they can apply for the fund as well. So go to our website and you'll see where you can apply for the creative grant. This grant is $30,000. Now this may help to patch a room. It may help to buy back some supplies. It may just help to support some
