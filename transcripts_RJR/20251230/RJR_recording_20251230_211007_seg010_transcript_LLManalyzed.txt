20251230 211007 My lady love With a love that's cozy as a fire's glow And I keep on needing you, girl, a little more and more And I thank you, my lady love You know it's not easy, keep love flowing smooth People are people and they all have their moves But it's so nice just to have someone like you Who wants a smooth and easy thing And all the good times that it brings? Lady love, you've been... Middle quarters, worry not yourself. You'll be up and running pretty soon, all right? My, my, my lady love.
