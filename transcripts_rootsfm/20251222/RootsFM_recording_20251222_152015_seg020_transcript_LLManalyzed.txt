20251222 152015 And I know those words that you And I know there's work to do I know when to put you closer And I know when to let you lose And I know the night is fading And I know the time gonna fly And I'm never gonna tell you everything I gotta tell you And I know I gotta give it a try And I know the road to riches And I know the ways to pay I know all the rules and I know how to break it And I only know the name of the game But I don't know, I believe it And I'll never let you fall And I don't know how you do it, making love But I'm not together, I'm not together
