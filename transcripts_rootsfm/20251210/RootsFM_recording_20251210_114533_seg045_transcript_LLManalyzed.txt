We know it has to be a compliment of decision makers. And how does it feel? Because you never make the 61 or the other number. Your time will come, your time will come, keep the faith. I trust that your time will come. And when you don't get it now, you'll get something better. Delay is not denial. Mm hmm. True words. All right. It is not denial. My dear, delay is not denial and we have to start believe that sometimes we're we just have, yeah, we just want everything. I mean, stay subtle. Get the job done. We just need this happen. You understand me? But at the same time, we have to say, look here, you know, God knows best. No matter how we look, we have to trust him. We have to trust and believe the process, you know, and pray and work. Do what we have to do to make a difference. Just like these 60 people, but probably never even dreamed of getting a home for Christmas.
