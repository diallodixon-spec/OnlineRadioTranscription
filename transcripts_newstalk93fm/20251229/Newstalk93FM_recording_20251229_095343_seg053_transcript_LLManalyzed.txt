20251229 095343 Now that's how I'm getting paid Cause that's your stage I'm done hiding Now I'm shining Like I'm gonna be We dreaming hard We came so far now I believe We're going up, up, up It's our moment You know together we're glowing Gonna be, gonna be golden Up, up, up With our voices Oh Waited so long to break these walls down to wake up and feel like me
