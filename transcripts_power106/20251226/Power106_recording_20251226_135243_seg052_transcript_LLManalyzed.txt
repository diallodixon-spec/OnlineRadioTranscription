20251226 135243 of love that all flows and anyone who knows us knows I would change all thoughts I have for you there is no low or high or in between of my heart that you haven't seen cause I share all I have and am Nothing I've said is hard to understand All I feel, I feel deep but still And always will All this love is for you Every note that I play Every word I might say
