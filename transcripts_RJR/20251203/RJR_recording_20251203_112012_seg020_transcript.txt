Morning, morning, morning. Dr. Taylor, we are last resort down here. Condition not pretty, and I tell you, I already say, if any church people not live down here, man, this place mash up, and they not recognize the Hanover, mash up, Dr. Taylor. And it's not a joke business. Down here, mash up. Me give God thanks to Reverend Ben Wright Clark. And me give God thanks to the rest of pastors and the other churches, them in a jammie, in a Hanover, where they give people things, send the Adventists, and the rest them. But with Reverend Ben Wright Clark, one of the loose, united church, him, they get pick up, out in one pocket, all bought, take your food, they feed people. You hear me say to you, everybody talking about that pastor specific. You understand me? Because every day in a pick up, in a pick up they all over the place they feed people, you understand me?
