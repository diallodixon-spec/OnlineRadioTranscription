He described the experience of performing live as "multi-dimensional and nuanced," where he feeds off the audience's energy and engages in a dynamic exchange. Wright also shared his thoughts on the importance of workshopping his pieces with fellow creatives and being open to feedback and criticism.

In addition to his thought-provoking poetry, Wright treated listeners to a lighter piece, "Tell from the Shell of a Colabash," which celebrates the joys of Jamaican culture and the simple pleasures of life. The poem is a vibrant tribute to the island's music, food, and traditions, showcasing Wright's ability to craft engaging and uplifting verse.
