I am with children, not having a title. She said, well, there's nothing, she said, well, okay, what you can do then is sit down and wait and somebody else will talk to you, but the title is not here. Now, again, I sat there when I see it was 20 of time left, and I got up and I went back to her. And I said to her, miss, I am here more than an hour, and I need my, she said, but you want it to wait because I tell you it is not here. It is not here. Well, you will speak to somebody here. Oh, hear me. I'm calling there. Somebody wants to number one, number one, personally speak to you. When I went to the young lady, number one, she said, Oh, I am so sorry. You may have a seat. And I told her, and she said, hold on, let me check. And she checked the book like the young lady did check. She said, shut the fuck. Because I just sent it down on the 3rd of October and it should have been back by now. Let me check. So she went to the cabinet and the girl come behind me and was shaking her hand. So I said no, don't bother looking another day. It's not there. So the lady continued to look.
