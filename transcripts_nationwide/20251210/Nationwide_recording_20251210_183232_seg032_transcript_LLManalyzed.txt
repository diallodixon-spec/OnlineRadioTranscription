I always say it you know that children after school dismiss and the children come together at one set location. Anything can happen dear so you know so you see when my daughter reach home and she called me and said mommy I'm home. The relief that I feel, the relief that I feel knowing that she's home it's it's just absolutely amazing and I always thank God that you know she reached home. Let me see if I can get in a few more comments on this public opinion. If you're just joining us the question is what's your reaction to the abduction and subsequent rescue of a six-year-old girl in Clarendon yeah Dale is saying thank God for placing these people at the right place to rescue this child we need to put more emphasis in neighborhood watch programs let me see God is good says Martin
