20251231 173921 I call it grace, grace, grace. Grace brought me here. If it wasn't for you, prayer. I call it grace. Grace, grace, grace brought me here. God, if it wasn't for your prayer. Times I've been lost and broken. Felt like I would have never made it through the day. But I know God has brought me here. Never knew you'd still be here Never knew you'd smile again Never know you'd hope again So I'm standing here today singing How did I get here I call it grace, grace, grace
