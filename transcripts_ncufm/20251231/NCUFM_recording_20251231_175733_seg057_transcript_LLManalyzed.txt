20251231 175733 to the drive on a daily basis. It's literally you and me who are tuned into the drive. That's the drive time family right there. Those of us who anticipate the start of the drive in the days, those of us who are tuned in, that means I have members of the drive time family who never text in yet. As they say, they are part of what they call themselves, silent listeners. Yeah, man. Listening here, tuning in here, is how you're a part of the Drive Time family. Yesterday, what I spoke about was like, you know, on radio we were talking and we just give out a Zoom link and some people did, we did do a meet and greet. That is from in 2020 though. Was it 2020, 2021 them times? So it was, it's nothing. The Drive Time family is us. So you listen to Drive, you are a part of the Drive Time family. No special entrance, no different, nothing other than that. You understand?
