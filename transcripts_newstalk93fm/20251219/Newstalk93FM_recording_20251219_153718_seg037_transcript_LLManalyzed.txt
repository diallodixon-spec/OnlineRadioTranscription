Led to fulfill your dreams. You had to get rid of me. I was your father figure We drank that brown liquor You made a deal with this devil Turns out my check's bigger You wanna fight, you found it I've got the place around it You'll be sleeping with the fishes Before you know you're drowning Who's put your tongue a man on? Who covered up your scandals?
