I feel good that I am back at school and getting back into my studies to learn about new things. What's your favorite subject? My favorite subject is social studies. Why social studies? Because you can explore, learn about history. Yeah, that's a good reason. I mean you've done PEP yet for grade five? No, I'm not PEP yet.
