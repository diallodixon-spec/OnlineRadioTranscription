20251225 132016 No chimney smoke, no bells to chime. Just the clock above my head ticking in time. But your bright eyes lights up the room all right. You're my holiday. You're my star tonight. Sorry, Santa, I don't want to waste your time. Give someone else a present. I've got mine. Got everything I need right here with me. Merry Christmas, everyone, wherever you may be. I don't need a stocking or a fireplace. Because I appear to put a smile on my face. We have each other like the moon and star. You are my Christmas, yes you are. I don't need it. You are home for the hips. 94. Where it always feels good.
