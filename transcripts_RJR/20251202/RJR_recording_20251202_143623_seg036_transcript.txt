because sometimes, you know, you tell people that, you know, people, you're a people, a barber, they may really understand that it really is a good, I tell the parents, they my graduation, you know, I say the amount of people barber see, if a liar see them, the amount of people, if they amount, they would be happy. I think barbering is more than just cutting here because sometimes persons come to the barber shop, they have a lot on their mind. So you can give a listening ears and, you know, voice, your opinion and stuff like that. They give a barbershop too? You think I'm going to get an ear dresser? No, man. What if him barber saves my life? What do you say, man? A therapy? Yes, man. Yes, man. A man, although he doesn't want trim, he just come at the barbershop. He just come there. You have some person where they hang out at the barber shop because barbershop is like a therapy. Yeah. Because, you know, barber always can listen on you. It's a social space where the man can come and just... I like that. It's like a family thing you know. I like that. And they know so wherever they talk at the shop it stays at the shop or not. Yeah they just don't talk nothing like that.
