20251229 095050 You're perfect. You're great. And you started this, you know, wonderful. Thank you for the pleasure. Yes, I know. I know. I have one question for you, though. You're an underage child. You're a U. a US citizen or permanent resident right now? Yes. Alright, so if it's an underage, no, it takes me about a year before the visa number before the I-130 is approved. So it's going to be pretty fast, especially since you're a U.S. citizen. That's a good question. The main thing I call you about is just to be thankful that I'm able to give you a call because you are also a new person. All right? All right, thank you so much.
