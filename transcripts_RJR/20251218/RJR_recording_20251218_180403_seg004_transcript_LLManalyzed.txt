20251218 180403 for funding to aid in thanks to Ibrahimov. He took my invitation in Belem at COP 30 recently. I'm happy that he was able to get his team here before Christmas. I thought it was important that they saw the scale of the damage because to understand, I mean, Jamaica's damage is $8.8 billion. The climate nucleus has only been able to raise $800 million globally for loss and damage. So it's not that this is going to solve all of our problems, but certainly understanding the magnitude of the challenge before us. We're duty-bound to reach out to every single relationship, every single agency, to bring them to the table.
