20251231 154631 just know you can never come back home don't let me down easy if you're gonna leave me baby go and leave me all the way don't ask for all your things back cussing out my name yeah just to go and take back what you say that you done had no take back Said you fell out of love and I hate that But see me, I was stuck like a drip Really fiending for love and somehow I can't shake back When you walked out that door, I was hurting All the dreams in my head, you was perfect You remember the very first time that we chatted, I reached for your hand where the nerves at. Time to pack, that's what it do. It be time to be sick sitting thinking about you. It was death do us part. So you gave me the blues. Really played with my heart. Left me lost in the fuel. But you made up the rules. On my heart lived a scar and a bruise. Hoped that you could stand on all the **** that you did. Cause I'm done, y'all finally through. Don't let me down.
