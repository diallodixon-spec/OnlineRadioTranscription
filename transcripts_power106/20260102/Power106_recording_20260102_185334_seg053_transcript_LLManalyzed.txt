20260102 185334 They were badly bruised on Tuesday. Their 4-0 hammering will resound in Villa. But they have a chance to rebound quickly. Forrest hasn't scored in a while. So they believe that they can get a win and get back to winning ways in the EPL. And certainly, I think that they will. Yes, because the basic quality is still there. They have a good season, one defeat. We shouldn't really derail it that much. All right, at 10 o'clock so Aston will unfortunately be the only match on screen at 7 30 then at 10 o clock Brighton will be at the Amics and Burnley away the group battle we see how they get on yeah Brighton has fallen into a slump and I think Burnley's starting to push the head out I think this game will end in a 1-1 draw expect it will be a score draw, but I don't think that there will be a win in that one. Yes, all right. All right, now, the high-riding Wolves, you have to say. Take on West Ham, and they'll be at Molyville, so interesting
