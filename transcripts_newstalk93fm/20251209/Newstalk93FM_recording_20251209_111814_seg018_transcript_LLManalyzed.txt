So every time an election is called, this body is constituted. And the members, it's four. Four selected members of the commission, two persons appointed by the governor general after consultation with the prime minister and the leader of opposition. And the chairman of the constituted authority shall be a retired judge. So this body, the constituted authority, is given certain powers under the Representation of the People Act. And this act, by the way, ROPA, we call it, ROPA, Representation of the people act, this is the act that governs elections in Jamaica. This is the act that speaks to everything about how elections are called, when they are held, how voting is to take place. And so it's within this act the constituted authority is created and established. And the authority has certain powers, and the powers include the powers to void, well, not so much to void them.
