People can access the roadway. However, it is a narrow passage, Mr. Hughes, and vehicles cannot park along that corridor. What we know of, and this has been allowed for persons who aren't able to enter from the roadway at the top with a small pedestrian gate, right? Of course not allowed to drive down to the down to the beach where the person can you can buy the vehicle but the vehicle would not be allowed to stay at that point because of narrow passage. So essentially what, by the way, we are up on the break. Hold the line for us. Okay, sir.
