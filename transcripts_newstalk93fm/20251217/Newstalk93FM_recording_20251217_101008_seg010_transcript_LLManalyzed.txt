We tend to say, boy, we can't bother with this, and we're not going to court and all sort of thing, and sometimes just surrender our right. So even just for that, I believe that commendation is in place for Mr. Paul Lennox Buchanan. Without further ado, let me welcome the candidate and caretaker for West Central St. Andrew, Paul Buchanan, to the microphone of News.93FM. Hi, Mr. Buchanan. I am very well, thank sir and you? I am good, I am good. I feel deprived but there are constitutional issues here, the denial of one litigant.
