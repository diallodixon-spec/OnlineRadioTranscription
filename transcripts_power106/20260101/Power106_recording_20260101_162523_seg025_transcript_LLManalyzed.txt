20260101 162523 I could beat myself I could beat myself over and over and over again Only if I could turn back the hands of time I could show you how our love can shine I don't even know what I wanna tell you man But I wanna tell you something real, real good Something pleasantities, For I and I are together in perfect unity, And give honor and glory unto he that is mighty. Yeah, Lord, well, send us your love.
