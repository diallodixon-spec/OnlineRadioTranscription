20260101 153717 Oh, yeah. Somehow, ever since I've been around you, you can go back to being my home. Can't help feeling, darling, since I found you. That I found my home, that I found my home. I said I'd never let nobody get too close to me, darling. I said I needed, needed you to be. But if you ask me to, I just might change my mind and leave you in my life forever. If you ask me to, I just might give my heart and stand here in your arms forever if you ask me to.
