20251231 152218 DJ Tero! Jump, jump, jump! Tell them we not leaving Till the last drop of a canal Is madness in the capital soul I feel like a running tongue again Jump and shake the grung again Wave with all the run and devil No place like home When we in silence, ocean of love All that we are lining to the stars up above Let we dance now, take a chance now with me Are we gonna jump till morning?
