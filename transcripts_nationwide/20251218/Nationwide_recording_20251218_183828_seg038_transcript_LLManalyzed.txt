But matters worse, me hear say half of the thing they missing, and me know say a customs. Girl, how you know say a customs? You should stop going like you have no sense, man. You know say everybody a talk about it in the media. You know one of us stop listen to hear say. You ever experience that? Customs not go into your package, suitcase, barrel or cargo unless you ship the item or the agent stand up right there when they inspect it. Listen, customs job is to protect the borders, collect revenue and to facilitate trade. They don't collect or store shipment, they inspect it and somebody has to present it for inspection. So how do customs ever get so much custom then? Tracy, and the customs are alone involved in the clearance process you know, even though it's them we tend to talk about. Look at it this way, shipment delayed, talk to your airline agent.
