20260101 111909 Like a rabbit's foot on keys or some lucky dice All I wanna need, I ain't gotta ask twice What would I be? What would I do? Without you looking out for me? Probably be, probably be in these streets Without you in my life My whole future ain't the same And I am not one to complain, baby I know I've been around, I Tired of messin' around, I Got so much love See, I got so much love for you with these arms Don't you know that you're my best love, John? Baby, what else I do?
