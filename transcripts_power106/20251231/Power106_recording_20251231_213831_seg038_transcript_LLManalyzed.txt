20251231 213831 You shouldn't try to change me, love me as I am You've been trying to make me over The way I talk, the way I wear my hair But if changing me, what's on your mind? Then girl, you're just a wasting time I girl, I'll be just fine So if you want me You gotta take me as I am Cause I've accepted you for what you are And if you need me You gotta try to understand You should try to change me, love me as I am There's so much I'd love to give you But it seems you want somebody else
