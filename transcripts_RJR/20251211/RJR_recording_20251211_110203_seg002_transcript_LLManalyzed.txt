Amid mounting frustration from residents, businesses and transport operators in Brownstone, Centanova, daily traffic gridlock, relief may soon be on the way. The roof of the transport center badly damaged during Hurricane Melissa is said to be removed and replaced. The damaged structure had forced taxi and bus operators to park along the streets, worsening congestions throughout the town.

Once a new roof is installed, operators are expected to return to the designated transport center, easing pressure on the town's main thoroughfares.
