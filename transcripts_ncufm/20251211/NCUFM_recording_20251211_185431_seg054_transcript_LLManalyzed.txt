2025-12-12 11:49:31 Jesus. We want to give our all to him. We want to totally surrender to him so that he can take control of our lives and so that his will can be done in our lives. That's his will for each and every one of us. So we want to sing that song to him today and we want you to lift your hands as we worship the Lord with this song and we're going to sing yes to our God. Yes, to Your will, Lord, I say yes.
