Send us a WhatsApp or text message. Follow us and message us on our social media platforms. We are on Facebook at power 106 FM, Instagram at power 106 underscore eight seven six. We're on exit power 106 FM J. A. And you can listen to us on our website at go-jamaica.com. Download the PowerO106fm app or one-spot media app from the Google Play Store or the App Store. So many ways for you to reach us and we do hope that you take advantage of that. Again, if you're calling on a Digicel phone, we might not be able to connect with you. So please feel free to call us on the Flow phone. Many people, Davin, have two phones. One on Flow, one on Digicel. So we're encouraging you to use your Flow phone this afternoon to make the calls.
