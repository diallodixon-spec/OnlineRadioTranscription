Christmas reminds us that light shines brightest in the darkest moments. In that spirit, I encourage each of us to show kindness by checking on the vulnerable, sharing what we have, offering encouragement, supporting community efforts, and extending patience and compassion in our daily lives. May this season renew our strength, unite us in purpose, and fill our homes with peace. May God bless you and may God bless Jamaica land we love. The proceeding was a Christmas Day message.
