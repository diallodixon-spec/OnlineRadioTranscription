20251216 143917 When a child is born A silent wish Sails the semen sea When there's a change I want to say a happy, happy birthday to Raven. I wish you nothing but blessings, prosperity, and happiness. You know it's always a vibe being around you. I know a church I wish I was representing. I want Raven though. Happy birthday, baby girl.
