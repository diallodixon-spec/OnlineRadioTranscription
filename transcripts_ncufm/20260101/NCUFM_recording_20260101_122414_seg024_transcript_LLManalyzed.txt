20260101 122414 We always win! We always win! In the arms of sweet deliverance I'm gonna lay my heavy burdens down And with my Lord I'll abide And when at last my traveling days are gone In the land of somewhere beyond the sun In the arms of Sweet deliverance In the arms Of sweet deliverance I will rest by and by. Oh, oh, oh. In the arms of Sweet deliverance, I'm gonna lay my heavy burdens down and let my Lord I'll abide.
