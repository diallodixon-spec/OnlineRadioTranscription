And I'll sing it to you time and time again I ain't much too serious And I don't wanna let you down I love, I love I love I love, I love you baby Don't you know I wanna be your man So let me love you Four seasons lover Hear you whispering into my ears Four seasons lover girl I'm your four seasons lover So no, you never give your life no, you should never give your love away When the winter comes around And there's nobody there to keep you
