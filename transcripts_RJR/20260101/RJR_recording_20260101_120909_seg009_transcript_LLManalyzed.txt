20260101 120909 modernizing Jamaican racing and strengthening its identity. We don't want to use those terms anymore. The Jamaica brand is strong, it's aspirational and as such we intend on changing the brand of racing in Jamaica. Every single practitioner within the racing industry has their own concern, has their own issue as a commission. Gone are the days where we're sitting in an office handing our decisions without hearing from the people. The fact of the matter is we intend to listen to the people. They may not agree with us all the time.
