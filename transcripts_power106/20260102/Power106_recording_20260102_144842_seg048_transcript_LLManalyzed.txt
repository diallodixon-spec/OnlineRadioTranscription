All the very best for 2026, Serpy. Same to you. Thank you. Is your last day of this? On the program? If it's my last day? On the program. Maybe, maybe not. Why you think so? I wonder why. Please, please, please. No, man. Let's move on from there, please. Come back, Sir P. Come on, you know better than that.
