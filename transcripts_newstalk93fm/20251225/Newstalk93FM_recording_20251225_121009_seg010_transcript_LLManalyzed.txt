20251225 121009 I feel a sugar rush in my vein One cup it does make my day I'm missing it, we're not gonna love her, yeah Eat me up Only you alone can bring fire back in the soul Eat me up Girl, you are the thing I could never leave you alone, no And no matter what they go say, I'm holding you close I could never let you go Miss Oshiney Girl, I'm coming home and I'll see you again All day through the night I dreamin' Miss Oshiné When you turn it up, make it smooth, my darling When outside is pouring rain Put a button on the fire Bubbling, you're bubbling, you're bubbling Raise the temperature higher Coming in your coming in your coming in closer Make the ting get your fire Spill it all on the ground All over the counter With a button deep fire Here's your cocoa tea
