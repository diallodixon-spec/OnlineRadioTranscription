$1200 per pound. Yeah, yeah, it's very hard. It's very hard. Because even one of of my friends where I help out more time. He means a trader. And he tells me why he can't deal so hard with the people on him because he's a farmer too. So when the people on him say he still has 1,000 or 1,200, he tells the people, six. And the people say no, it's in the market for $1,000, soroy, don't move.
