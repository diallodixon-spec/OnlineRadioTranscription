2025-12-12 11:04:29 I don't want to, I'm another melody I don't want, to, live my life without you There's gotta be a place, for anything I really don't feel like falling anymore And I haven't had a piece of leave at all Never sent you it away Baby, my whole life has changed I don't wanna love And I don't wanna live And I don't want you
