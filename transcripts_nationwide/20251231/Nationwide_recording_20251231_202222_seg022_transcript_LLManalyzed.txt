20251231 202222 I ain't with this hot since I was 18 Apologize if I say Anything I don't feel the same next year boy And I'll be right here in my spot With a little more cash than I already got Tripping off you cuz you had your shot With my skin tan and my hair long My fans who've been so patient, me and 40 back to work But we still smell like a vacation, hate your rumors, hate the allegations I'm just feelin' like the throne is for the takin' All I care about is money and the city that I'm from I'ma sip until I feel it, I'ma speak until it's done, I don't really care
