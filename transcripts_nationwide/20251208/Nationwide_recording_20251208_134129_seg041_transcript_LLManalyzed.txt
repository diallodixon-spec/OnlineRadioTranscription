know-how. So let's understand that what we're talking about is you still have the ability to sue for damages and you don't have to prove it is the person who you sue. If it is a media house, the media house has to prove their innocence. Everybody else is guilty until proven innocent. In these instances, a media house is sued, a journalist is sued, the journalist has to prove his innocence or her innocence. It is, as I understand it, one of the few, if not the only case in which the person who is accused of doing the wrong has to be the person who demonstrates their case of innocence rather than the other way around. But if that happens, we then have to come to the point where there is damages that is paid but this one says you could have that but you could also still go to prison if the criminal one is allowed to be reintroduced so it could be criminal go to prison
