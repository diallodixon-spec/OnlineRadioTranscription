This one goes out to every friend to discuss your behavior. When you reach the road, get on like a catch-up. Advertise the mode. Jump up cause it's one from my life. Deep under the air. Inside the air, you're bound to find fine display of itself like we don't care about nobody Drop your location, tell me where you want me to find you. With no hesitation, I'll leave and you in line for you. Drop your location, show me where you want to find you, with no hesitation, make me by your side. We're ready for the road, Nathan. The road, Nathan.
