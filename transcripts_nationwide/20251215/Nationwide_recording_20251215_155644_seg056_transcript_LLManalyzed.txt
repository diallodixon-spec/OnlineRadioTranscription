20251215 155644 with me. I watched the snowflakes falling from the skies, I can't lost the memories. The time we tried to build a snowman, the time we tried to count the stars. It's crazy how we didn't know that, that we'd ever be apart. I can hear the music playing See the lights upon the tree I can feel the joy in every soul Moving me is incomplete And I try my best to play the part But no matter what I do No, it just don't work I never knew there was a Christmas song
