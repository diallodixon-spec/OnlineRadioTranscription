Alright, that's Robert Green from Lucky Valley District. November 18, 2025 and I live in St. Andrew where we were seriously impacted by Melissa. I called JPS this morning and I'm getting information on my bill that was due November 2025. I need to get my bill so that I can pay because I know they will be disconnecting my service on November 16 for non-payment. I think that they had suspended the disconnection for now though. Let's see. Somebody said tell buster for watching speech, whatever that means. Chop chop. Okay, that's you.
