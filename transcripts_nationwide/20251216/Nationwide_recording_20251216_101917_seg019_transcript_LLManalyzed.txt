So it's less a question of where the money is coming from, but more about the government's ability to spend it. Concern about underexpenditure on capital projects goes back as far as 2017, when then-EPOC chairman Senator Keith Duncan raised the matter. Over the last three budgets, the government has underspent unplanned capital projects by as much as $20 billion. This has forced funds to be diverted to recurrent expenditure or simply returned to the consolidated fund for future budgets.
