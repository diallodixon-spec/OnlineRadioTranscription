20260101 182010 I feel a broken heart And true love never ends So why not start where we began? Because I still say yes To you again My darling, for you I'd do it all again Yes, I still say yes to you again. I do it over and over again. Over and over again. You're not alone, I know I know it's gonna hurt your heart again
