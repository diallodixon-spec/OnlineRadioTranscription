20251217 141212 Come back to me cuz you know, you're my healing Oh I tell you so much of my mind that I can't sleep I stress it all the time, I can't stop it Cause I'm always on the grind, my body's not keep up Deep behind all of my mind, whole week Take your troubles and drive them all away Get ready to run across the stretch Get ready, get ready
