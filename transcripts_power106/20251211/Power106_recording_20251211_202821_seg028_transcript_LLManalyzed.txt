2025-12-11 22:03:21 In this heart fire we're feeling burning sun Our offering life pain that we gave for the day I see the red man in front of us to take it all away The red man, rain man The rain man Rain man, rain man, the rain man Tomorrow is another rain day Tell him to die, tell him to die So when the rain man comes honey, tell him that you won't get no money for this stupid living in your man's land.
