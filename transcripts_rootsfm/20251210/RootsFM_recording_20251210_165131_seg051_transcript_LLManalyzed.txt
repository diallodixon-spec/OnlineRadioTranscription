============================================================

I feel so unsure As I take your hand And lead you to the dance floor As the music dies Something in your eyes Calls to mind a silver screen Y'all, it's time to good-bye I'm never gonna dance again Guilty feet have got glory life No one's easy to pretend I know you're not a fool You should have known better to cheat and play Wasted chance that I could be forgiven So I'm never gonna dance again The way I danced with you
