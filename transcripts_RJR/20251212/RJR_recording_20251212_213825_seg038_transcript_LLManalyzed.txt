20251212 213825 Everybody be a get-up-a-na. Knock up your friends, dance with your friends. Hey! I know I'm not a cop, I'm a bad man, so I'm not a yard man When I tell you we're real or never, I'm not real, I'm not this man, Valentine, but I'm not a gal, gal Dance on me in everything, dance all the way, everything We dance all day, the sun sits in the air, the yard man there, dancers there
