20251231 181608 with this national tag team. All right, Enshamu, welcome to the show. My name is Kate Williams. Good night. Good night. Thank you for having me. Good to be here. Oh, absolutely. Wonderful to have you. We'd like to talk or speak to champions on the show. But Enshamu I'll talk about your introduction to this sport now. How did all that come about? Well, surfing is the kind of sport that you have to get into at a younger age if you really want to make it professional because there's so many intricacies in the sport of surfing and it just takes a really long time to really develop a good style and a good approach to the sport. I started really young. I was probably five or six when I started right here in Bull Bay, Jamaica. I fell in love with surfing.
