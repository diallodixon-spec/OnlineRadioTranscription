I want to say thanks to church man too but I also think that church man needs to have a little prayer yeah with a strong woman who can help him understand why African women wear their hair low. Take good care of yourselves everybody and please go do some reading my friends who don't know anything about Haiti and what's happening in Venezuela and the other countries that have oil and other resources okay we don't don't worry I can leave by telling you we don't have a lot of resources what we have are our people resilient lovely warm people who refuse to grow up and ask their governments to be accountable. See you again tomorrow.
