20251212 172117 Oh baby please, oh baby please You know see me I know like bad energy Oh baby please You so picky and I noticed it And I saw more come around I keep me, my love trigger me I know they like who they found gangster But the girls wear love, but don't bother with me It's a little bit lonely in the way But we'll let go, we carry your load, you could save me One pretty girl, And then you miss my one touch, hello.
