How much for them? $400 per pound. That's not bad, that's not bad. So tell me something, if I come with about $4,000, I can let me two good bags. So we are going to let Auntie Suzie sort out her stall because business is going as usual here in Papina. We don't want to take up too much of her time because there were customers coming there and she asked them to hold down so she could speak to us. I come to the market as often as I can. I try to come to the market and auntie Susie is one of the persons that I buy from. Oh nice, good, so you have a relationship over time, good vibes. She's not a stranger talking to us, she sees me from time to time. One to Irish, quickly, one more thing, Irish potato. Thank you very much, you're welcome.
