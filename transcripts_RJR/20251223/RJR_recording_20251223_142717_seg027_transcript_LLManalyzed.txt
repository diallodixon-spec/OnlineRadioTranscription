20251223 142717 it's now 1991 this was the year after graduation I played some songs for momma ritz I had that girl from around the way ub be 14 was on your plate I can't forget that holiday Pumpkin gate stole her heart away And I had to learn the hard way She'll always be a part of me It's until I met that Mary Jane Oh, let the dream come true I'm an old song Living in the body of a twelve year old Guess I've been here before I'm an old soul Tribute to the ones who made it all possible Inside me a legacy lives on
