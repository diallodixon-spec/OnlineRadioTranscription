That's her great form continuing. And again, remember that she had a bad injury ending the last season, I think, or earlier this season. So that would have taken her out of international competition somewhat because the club was trying to protect her, I think. And in the Guardian, it had said she had taken a year off, but they didn't say for what reasons. But now that she's back, I think you should see her climbing the ladder back up again. I mean, as a Ballon d'Or, highly ranked Ballon D'Or candidate, she's naturally going to go right back up in the rankings. Let's focus a little bit on her strike rate. She has the highest at the international level, believe it or not. 60 goals in 45 games. That gives her a 1.33 per match to be scoring more than one goal per match. Never mind the opponent. I think it's a special chance. That's a superb feat. I don't even think some of the greatest male players have anything remotely close to that.
