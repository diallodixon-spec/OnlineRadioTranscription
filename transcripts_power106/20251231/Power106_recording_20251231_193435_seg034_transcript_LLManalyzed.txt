20251231 193435 whiskey celebration still on and will be on all night tonight so whiskey tomorrow hope everybody who celebrates tonight will be in good good enough shape after those spirits to be involved at Caymanas tomorrow so whiskey has been running very well it's already gained even and consistent in fact there's one three of his last seven oh half a dozen races. So he's consistent. He lost the last one by half a length, going over five and a half for longs, and he didn't get the best of starts either. He stumbled at the start, but still managed and would have won without that bit of bad luck. All right. The threats are number three, Sonny T and Chippy, to be written by Shane Ellis, Badger of Honor for Meritorious Service. He will write Sunny Tea and Chippie, which should be a big threat to whiskey over this same furlong trip. Number eight, Further and Beyond, I believe, was a house of the year five or six years ago.
