20251216 212920 updated but that's the last check I made on the road traffic law. I just mentioned that Dr. Mackenzie mentioned the question of you know we discussed the question of going over the median but I find that they use three devices to to amazing fact to provide the traffic. One is going up in the right turning lane and then shooting across the traffic going in the middle lane or other lane. The second thing is just overtaking with impunity in the right lane and it happens on where there's a construction on Wellington Drive and the traffic builds up, people just overtake on the right hand side. So you have that and you have the people who, well not to mention those who go on the unbroken white line and not supposed to do that but do that because they want to do it.
