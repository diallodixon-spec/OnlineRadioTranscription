So when you don't want me to read stuff about labor rights because you're a labor right, I find it actually funny because I read even the ones you write to cuss me. So what does that say about me? You write garbage about me that you don't know from Adams. Let me put it in Jamaican terms. And I still read it. I actually read it. I've actually been approached by people that says, Herbs, why do you read these things? Because I respect you. I think even if you don't respect yourself, I have a right to respect you as a human being. I respect even the garbage you write. Yes, I'm weird. I will read it. Once you don't have expletives and stuff and so forth, all the foolishness you write and some of the defense of the government is absolutely pathetic and lame. I still read it.
