============================================================

when you're gone I'll just cry all night long say it is all true and don't it make my brown eyes blue tell me no secrets, tell me some lies Give me no reasons, give me alibis Tell me you love me and don't let me cry Say anything but don't say goodbye I didn't mean to treat you bad Didn't know just what I had But honey now I do And don't wanna take my hand
