Hey, what a beautiful song. I just want to remind you once again, I know I've done it many times, but this used to be our station song, opened the morning with this particular song, our theme song for the station and for many, many years. And rightly so, such a powerful song. 21 minutes after the hour of 10 o'clock, you're in Tune to Roots. FM 96.1 on the FM band. Now the rain is gone I can see all our stickers in my way Gone are the dark clouds that had me blind It's gonna be alright
