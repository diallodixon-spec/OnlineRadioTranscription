============================================================

as unfortunate as it may seem, the law does not consider it as stolen property because all someone has to do is show that they have been under property, taken care of it, fencing it, whatever for at least 12 years, undisturbed, without your permission, and the law says they can become the legal owner. The law doesn't consider it that. The second part of your question, can you reclaim your land if you can prove you were overseas and unable to travel to Jamaica? No. As unfortunate as it may be, you know, I get it. For whatever reason, you cannot travel to Jamaica. You're probably saying, you know, if I could, I would have been there. I didn't abandon the land. I didn't give it up. It was not something I desired, but the law doesn't see it that way. All the law cares about is that you weren't there and you hadn't been there, hadn't shown any physical connection with the land.
