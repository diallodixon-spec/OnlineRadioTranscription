Feelings today swing like Tim-Tim-Tim-Timber Nick Adjuru Adjuru. I'm a white dog, keep them in soup. Why you say I did nothing for you? If I do anything, you want me to do. Timber Nick n***a true or true? Tell me why you don't think we'll finish soon? Why you say I did not do anything for you? Won't have to anything you want me too do Maybe another time, maybe another life You will be my wife and we'll get it right We don't cast, last last Now now everybody go chop breakfast Have to say bye bye yo, bye bye yo To the love of our life, my ayo Don't cry yo, I need you boy I shall yo I need you boy, I shall yo
