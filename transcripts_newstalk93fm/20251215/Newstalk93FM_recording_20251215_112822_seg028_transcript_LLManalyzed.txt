20251215 112822 Mary, hold on, hold on. I am staying on the surface of it. The surface of it, what that meets the eyes. I'm saying here and now that the maroon was given the offer through its chief, Corey. They said that, listen, they don't need the army there. They can basically do their own build out. Other people, and I call a name, for example, MP Burchell, Nikesha Burchell, is saying that, listen, her people have been devastated. They can do with the help from the army. Among others, send them there. Corey said them can do them thing, make them do them thing. You know so so those are some of the things Mary.
