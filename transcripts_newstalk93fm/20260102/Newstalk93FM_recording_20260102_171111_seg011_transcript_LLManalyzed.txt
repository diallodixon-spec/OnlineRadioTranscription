20260102 171111 Come on to me, come on to me. Come on to me. This is my apology. Follow me. Come and see what you mean to all of me. You're a treasure in my eyes. The greatest pleasure in my life Cause when you're living by the moon Honesty, hurry please Home is where the heart should be Pretty feathers in disguise Not together we will rise So don't you ever Let me down again Cause I'm depending on you So you better come through this time please hear my cry and if I ever let you down my friend it was a misunderstanding so if I took you for granted then I promise come through this time
