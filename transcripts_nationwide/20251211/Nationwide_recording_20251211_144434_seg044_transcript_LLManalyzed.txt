The sugar and spice Like fire and ice I will sacrifice Cost me the bend The assembly Money in the bank I've got to get it back I've got a weakness for sweetness I'm going here for ladies who dance in taco. I don't know what I'm able to do, I'm close, I'm personal, get in the face and shadow, tell all you all, man, what do I feel? Okay, they know my name is here, I won't let them vandalize or deal, some I won't fix, I'm already f***ed, none of them out there don't care. I can't, I can't hear you, we go for something else.
