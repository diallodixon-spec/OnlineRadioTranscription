20251229 124836 I have no problem with you even taking four years. But during those three or four years or two years, tell me that you've done the investigations and now, now that you've made some arrests, there is certainty. The problem, honestly, is that if the state were to jail anybody, find anybody guilty, and send anybody to jail, people would be shook. I have to borrow some Gen Z words now. People would be shook, I'm certain people would go into shock because that's not our prior knowledge, that's not our cultural reference point. The cultural reference point in Jamaica is that there are four Jamaicas. There is the inner city and we know exactly how the state approaches inner city males. Yeah, they can be killed without any investigation. May God bless
