20251215 121108 The request and welcome drive right now is that our people be blessed in Jesus' name. No more gun violence, Father. We ask of you in the name of Jesus Christ of Nothin'. Them say we mash up that, we dash with that, and we throw you today Trinidad Road and Barbados Road. Capture and Gully in the name of Jesus Christ. Let the people know that we are one and out of many, we are one today. So the request on their heart, God almighty, is that the love will continue in St. Anthony's North and St. Anthony Central South in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth. And today, wherever K and JB is today, we ask of you to make the love continue in the name Jesus Christ of Nothern. Wherever brother Jason is today, let the love continue.
