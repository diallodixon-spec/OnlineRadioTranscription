20251230 171610 excuse me, a trough across Jamaica. The trough is expected to remain over the next few days. Additionally, a cold front currently across the northwestern Caribbean is projected to move within the vicinity of the island tomorrow through Thursday, bringing cooler temperatures mainly across northern parishes during this time. In our 24-hour forecast tonight, partly cloudy, minimum temperature expected for Kingston tonight at 24 degrees Celsius. Minimum temperature expected for Montego Bay tonight at 23 degrees Celsius. And that is it for this evening's news package written and produced by the Sun City News Center. I'm Jodhian Bekford on behalf of the Sun City New Center. Have a pleasant evening and continue tuning in to the Heat Wave with Sun Jack Alipatch.
