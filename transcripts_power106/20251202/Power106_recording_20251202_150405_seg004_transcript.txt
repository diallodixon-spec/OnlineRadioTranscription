So we're talking about taking civil action against the against the person. But one of the things that we have also been discussing is what about criminal liability on the part of the individual whose animals it is. The problem is that sometimes it's not all the time that you can identify who to whom the animals belong. So that is part of the challenge. But I quite agree with you, Mr. Pekka, that legislatively, this lead has to come from the government. I know that part of the issue is that we do not have enough facilities to house these animals that have been let loose. Yes. So that is something that we will definitely have to address. All right. I see another message here that says, good afternoon, Althea. I see where Prime Minister is saying that he's going to go toe to toe with social media bloggers who criticize him.
