20251226 125646 offering on OSS at Christmas. It's a collaborative piece from a team headed by Joanne Richards-Gough with lead vocalist Yamig Hansen. A strong reminder that Jesus is there. Hey! Taxation time! Mary and Joseph had a bet they'd get pregnant. Mary, she couldn't wait no longer. So Jesus born in a fleck, they kept it going. Saddest thing, from inn to inn, in there, in there. We'll see how you are finally there in there in there, we'll see how you're finally there. What do you see? What do you do see? What are you saying? What do you think? What are we seeing in there?
