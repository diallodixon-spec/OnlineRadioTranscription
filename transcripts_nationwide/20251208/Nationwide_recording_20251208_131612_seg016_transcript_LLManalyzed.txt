Act is sufficient to adequately deal with it. It just went through a round of amendments recently, but there still are some questions left hanging because what the state needs to be looking at is how do we incentivize appropriate behavior and protect citizens.

The E-Zone is here for you! With this thing I'm honeybee! And curry boy-tings! From 3 to 5 PM!
