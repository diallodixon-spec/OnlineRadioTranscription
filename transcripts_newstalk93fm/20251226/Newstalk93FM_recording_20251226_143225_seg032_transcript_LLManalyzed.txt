Rumble, beat, beat, beat. Things so sweet, sweet, sweet. Feel complete, cause we love you back there now. Beat, beat, rumble, beat. Beats, beats, things so sweet. Sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet. Feel complete, cause we love you back an' I. Heat, heat, rum go beat, beat, beat. Things so sweet, sweet sweet. Well it must be cannibal. Love the way that you bring a vibe. With your hands them up in the sky. Rolling back an' having a time.
