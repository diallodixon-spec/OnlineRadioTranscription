I wanna be your man. Would you be my momma? Would you be momma? I'd stay with you, I'd live with you I'd wanna be your man, would you be my mama? Thought I could leave without you. Thought everything would would be fine I saw nothing special about you But still you were plaguing my mind I used to take you for granted You were the last name in my life Presently you're the most wanted ever
