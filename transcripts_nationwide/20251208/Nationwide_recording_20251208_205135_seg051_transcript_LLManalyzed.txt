Paradise is very nice Next phase is this Black Santa, he'd be ten days to reminisce Scars my witness I paid the for paradise, so I'm living this I never limit myself to else fearless Lay back while I illuminate the darkness Like it's smooth, don't ya? Make it move, won't ya? Think I won't? Take it to your peak, I know the mothercats don't and it won't stop This is beyond paper First I get your mind right, then I might drape ya Never pimp it, raise my girls well Young thoroughbreds get schooled by Uncle LL C double, L tattooed on the bubble Lay the mink down, let you walk over a puddle True love is so rare, but don't you worry I ain't goin' nowhere
