20251226 205446 It's a tragedy for me to see the dream is over And I never will forget the best of me Now I can't erase those memories Like a fairy tale, you were so unreal You left a scar that's so hard to heal When you had a taste of paradise Back on earth, can't feel as cold as ice I'm gonna miss you I'm gonna Miss you I miss you Getting all the love I feel for you
