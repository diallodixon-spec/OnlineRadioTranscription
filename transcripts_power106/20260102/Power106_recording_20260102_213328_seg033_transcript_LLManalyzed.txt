20260102 213328 In the summertime when the weather is hot You can stretch right up and touch the sky When the weather's fine You got women, you got women on your mind Have a drink, have a drive Go out and see what you can find If a daddy's rich, take her out for a meal If a daddy's poor, just do what you feel Speed along the lane, you can down or return a twenty-five When the sun goes down, you can make it bigger, good or lullaby We're not great people, we're not dirty, we're not mean We love everybody, but we do as we please When the weather's fine, we go fishing or go swimming
