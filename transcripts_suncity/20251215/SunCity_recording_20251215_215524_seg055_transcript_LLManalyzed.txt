20251215 215524 I make ya bump, bump, wiggle and shake your rump. Cause I be kickin' the flight, but that makes you wanna jump. How high, real high, cause I'm just a fluff. A young, lovable, huggable type of guy. And everything is to the back, with a little slack. Cause inside out, it's wiggity wiggity, wiggity, whack. Wiggity wigity wiggity whack. I come stompin' with somethin', pumpin' to keep it jumpin'. R&B, rappin', bullcrap is what I'm dumpin'. Ain nothing stuck about me. First of all, we all act so when Bad man powers, batman pull up. Batman powers, Batman pull up. Batman pulls up, Batman pulls up Batman powers, Batman pulls up. Batman powers Batman pulls up.
