20251223 172011 Welcome to Auto World on Power 106 FM. I'm Shailene McLaggen. It's Tuesday, December 23rd, 2025, and we're in high gear, high preparation mode as persons get ready to move into their Christmas holiday here and all around the world. But we're looking at Jamaica and we're looking at the public transport system at Christmas time. Some of the main considerations from the public transport operators ahead of the height of the Christmas season and assurances that the public can rely on as it pertains to service delivery and safety. So we're going to be joining Mr. Edgerton Newman, President, Transport Operators Development Sustainable Services, TODS, to get all the details. Mr. Todd? Hi. Season's greetings, Charlie. Yes, compliments of the season to you, too. It's been a little while since we last spoke. How are you? Yes, I'm good. I'm giving thanks for life, and that's the most important thing right now.
