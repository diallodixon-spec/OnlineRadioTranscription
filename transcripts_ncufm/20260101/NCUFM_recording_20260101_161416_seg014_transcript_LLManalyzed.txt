20260101 161416 And Michael, God has been so good to me. And I have to praise him. It's not a good time or a bad time, because it's not easy. The road is not easy, but you have to trust in the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit, and hold on to him and change him. And Michael, I tell you, it's not complicated, because'm not giving them no way to enter me. You know, see it? I'm having a little 10-year-old when I take care of myself at school, great grad. You know, I cook, I wash, I do everything for myself. In between, I get help, but if I don't get no help, I just do my thing, you know? God has carried me through right, through manner. I cross over. I cross over Michael. One more time on them. One more ear on them. One ear on them again, Michael. And I have to just praise him and give him thanks.
