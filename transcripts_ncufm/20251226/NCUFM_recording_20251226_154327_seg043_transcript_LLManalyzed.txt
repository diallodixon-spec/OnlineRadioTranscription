20251226 154327 Now, till you turn my life around, man Seems like I always fall short of being worthy Cause I ain't good enough, but he still loves me I ain't no superstar, the spotlight ain't shining on me Cause I aint good enough But he still loves me, loves me I used to wake up some days and wish I'd stayed asleep Cause I went to bed on top of the world Today the world's on top of me Now everybody's got opinions They've been in my position And that a break in my heart when I hear what they have to say about me What they say about you I'm not always portion of being worthy But I ain't worthy Cause I ain't good enough But you still love me
