============================================================

Don't let me down easy if you gonna leave me Baby go and leave me all the way Don't ask for all your things back Cussing out my name, yeah Just to go and take back what you say Burn all the bridges Don't ask for forgiveness Walk away like I'm someone you hate Don't let down easy If you gonna leave me Baby, go and leave me all the way. If you said that you done had no tape back, said you fell out of love and I hate that. But see me, I was still like a drip, really fiending for love, and somehow I can't shake back. When you walked out that door, I was hurting, all the dreams in my head.
