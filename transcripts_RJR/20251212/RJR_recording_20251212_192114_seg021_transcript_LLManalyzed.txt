They say the first five years have everything to do with how the next 80 turn out. So I'm picturing a world, you know, 10, 15 years from now, these children are young adults. What does that world look like to you? What will think Equal have done? It will have created something of a generation. Every year, we will bring on 10 new countries.

Well, Lesley, I, for one, look forward to hopefully living in a world where I can see more of this. So thank you for what you've shared today.
