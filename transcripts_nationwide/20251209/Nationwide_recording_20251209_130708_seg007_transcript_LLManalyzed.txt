The sweetest dream would never do I still miss you babe, and I don't wanna miss a thing Lying close to you, feeling your heart beating And I'm wondering what you're dreamin' Wondering if it's me you're seeing And then I kiss your eyes And thank God we're together And I just wanna stay with you In this moment forever Forever and ever I don't wanna close my eyes I don't wanna fall asleep cause I miss you baby And I don't wanna miss a thing
