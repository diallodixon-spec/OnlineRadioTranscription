20251217 134539 Let me see if I understand you. You want the government that is my tax dollar to pay to bring in solar panels to sell to back to me? Sell it back to the people for a cost. And then you would buy less crude oil. We would have less US currency to buy and trade it so high. Does that make sense? Well, I agree with you that we need more renewable energy to reduce the cost. But I think, you know, there are private enterprises here that are doing that. Well, then let the government put a foot into it and start to help because it would let crude oil have to be bought oil manufacture. And if you see the point, I'll get you that. Right. You think the government should also start buying cars and bringing them in at a cheaper price? I wish I could continue what they're now saying. I'm bored inside so I should sell my boat out. Thank you very much. Yes, man. You take care.
