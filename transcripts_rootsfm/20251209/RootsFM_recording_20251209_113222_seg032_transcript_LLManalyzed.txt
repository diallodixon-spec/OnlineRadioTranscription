up Tuesday for sure we are in Gather and Chat and feel free to call us 876-580-5706 Chris Martin. I know that you're feeling much better. Unfortunately you weren't able to do the show on the weekend but we know and we see where you did an extraordinary job over there in Sierra Leone. I hope you are feeling much better after your fall and you know look forward to bigger and better things, right? It's 1132 and we're making a big deal of this couple who was in my studio a couple months ago and they are volunteers um joseph jarrett johnson and alicia rosemary who are married and they visited us here at mustard seed roots of them for circle time and of course we are really happy that they're able to speak to us about their mission. You know, they found Mustard Seed Communities as one of their missions and did a lot of work here with us. And then they're still in Jamaica doing great work. So we say they're a big deal and a ton of.
