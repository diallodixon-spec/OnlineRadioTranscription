20251225 200805 When the world sends here And you'd like to find a way To show the things that words can't say Why don't you give love on Christmas day? The man on the street and a couple of stairs All need to to know there's someone who cares. Give love on Christmas Day. No greater gift is there than love. What the world needs is love. Yes, the world needs your love. Why don't you give love on Christmas Day? Oh, every little child on the saddest peak has room for your love underneath his tree. Give love on Christmas Day.
