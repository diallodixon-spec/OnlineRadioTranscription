20260102 212113 Just give it time And just give it time And give yourself a chance to grow And once you make it, you will know So give it time Why be one of the crowd? Yes, you could mean So much more And why not praise Jah? And be proud, be proud Jah Jah will open so many doors There's a footprint that you're leaving on the sands of time today. And I hope the tide that washes clean don't take it all away. There's an imprint that's you're leaving on this place.
