You're listening to Power 106 FM. The time is now 1.15. Never leave cooking unattended, especially when using stove tops or ovens. Keep flammable items such as kitchen towels and curtains away from heat sources. Learn about grease fires and how to douse them. Never use water to put out a grease fire. Instead, simply close the lid to suffocate the flames from oxygen, or have a Class B dry chemical fire extinguisher easily accessible in your kitchen. Make sure to clean your oven and stove top regularly to prevent grease buildup. That was a fire prevention and safety tip from your friends at Power106FM.
