I've been on that type of time, a demon All the time I was outside, I was creepin' It was love at first sight, girl, when you walked in Couldn't look deep in your eyes cause I get locked in You was hurtin' deep inside and you was broken But I was on the other side and didn't notice, oh I won't waste no time I won't waste my time when it comes to you. Put my pride aside, give it all to you put my pride aside give it all to pull it up fast for you two to three bucks round for you all eyes on me got me feeling like but i do it all for you don't get caught up in them lies before you know the truth i'll be down and risk it all if you ask me to ain't playing with your heart because that's too much to lose you put it
