20251222 140709 I'm just a victim of poverty Where there is life, then there's hope, they say So I know that there'll be a better day All I got to do is open chest and pray And I know that my God will lead the way I say it's not easy On my pilgrim's journey The burden I carry Lost more than I can bear Why should I worry When I can break it
