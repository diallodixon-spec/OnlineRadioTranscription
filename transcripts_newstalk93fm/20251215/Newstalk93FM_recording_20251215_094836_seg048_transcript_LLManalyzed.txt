20251215 094836 even commend Corey and the people of Akampong there to say listen boy we were thinking about sending in the army but you have basically give us an alternative now say you will basically take that on so what we're going to do is to give you the material that you want and use the manpower and skill set of the army elsewhere that is even more in need? Sorry, did the Prime Minister say what exactly the Army would be doing when they're going to a compound? It's essentially rebuilding, but I think there's a focus on re-roofing because it seems to me as if there has been major roof damage there. So if that is the purpose of where I ask the question, if that is the term of reference, the technical rebuilding, and the gentleman down there is saying we have the skilled tanks but no tanks, as I said it's a reasonable position and I think it should be respected.
