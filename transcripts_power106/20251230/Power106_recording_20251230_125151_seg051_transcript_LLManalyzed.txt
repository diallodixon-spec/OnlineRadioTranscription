20251230 125151 have been charged. Right. And some charges, one of the charges is an operated and an unlicensed entity, right? Yes. Now, what surprises me that is just this point I want to find out. That SSL, was it listed on the stock market? I would have to check. I'm not aware. I would like to find out if they know before the program ends because this is one of the things that worries me. Anyhow, that is what I call about. I was trying to get Mr Mr. Aiman today to ask him, you know. But then it was around five, three minutes to eleven, you know. And then when the program closed at eleven, so I didn't have the opportunity to ask him. That's a good question, you know. That's good question because if they were operating without a license, were they on the stock exchange?
