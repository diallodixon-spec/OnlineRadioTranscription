20251231 211715 It's already here. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Well, what's not already here yet, but it's, you know, approaching is your upcoming album, Welcome to Paradise. Yes. Can you just kind of tell us the inspiration behind this project? How many songs can we expect? Yes. So the inspiration behind Welcome to Paradise is a combination of being part of the one love movie and then paradise. So in other words, the song that kind of really put me out there is called Paradise Plot, if anybody watching knows that song. And truthfully, I realized that I found a sound of my own through that song. I never sit on a planet. I just realized that became a signature Naomi Cowan thing. And so I thought to myself, I don think I had really leaned leaned into the full capacity of what Paradise Plum could have been because I'm very experimental like all artists I try I do everything and it's not even I trying to get a boss I just did what I was inspired by so here it is I'm working on this movie big 60 70 million
