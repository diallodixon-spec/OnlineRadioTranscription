20260101 190603 Oh I never knew you'd say You'd be next to me One of those days, one of those days All of my life, now I never know you'd say You'll be next to me one of those days You woke me up this morning Saw started me on my way. From my table, you brought joy to my day. I'm glad you told me that there's no change, and I'm wonderful.
