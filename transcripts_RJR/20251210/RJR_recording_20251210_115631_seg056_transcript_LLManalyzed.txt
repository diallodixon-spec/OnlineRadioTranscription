Pretty long one, but actually I have the information coming in now, so I will forward that on to you. All right then. Thanks Dr. Taylor. All right. I believe I might not have time for another one, but give us a little bit of information, a reminder, as to what the law or the policies say about estimated bills from all of the service providers, especially NWC and JPS. Normally for estimated bills for the large provider, which is JPS and NWC, normally no more than two estimated bills should go to customers. Once it passes two, then that's a breach of the guaranteed standards. For JPS and for NWC, most of the breaches are automatic.
