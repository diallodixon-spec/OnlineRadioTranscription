20251229 122715 is, if we cut off the cable, we won't see TVJ nor CBN, or OUR needs to intervene and see to it that our bill is reduced, we have nothing to watch on flow. Hmm. Yes, OUR, where are you? This one says, good day Mr. Morris, I'm asking you to put it on the air to the Prime Minister's Holiness that we in West Milan need some help with gas to run the generators at night. What about gas vouchers, even for a week? Running generators for two months is very expensive. We're running them with our money now. Thank you. Yeah, generators are very expensive, you know. I can understand. I see where one area of the island, where JPS has put up an emergency facility, the place escapes me right now. I know it's in the west of Central Smith or somewhere there. Could they do something similar for Westmoreland, or areas of Westmoreland?
