20251215 165735 Now I'm breathing no longer, a-bouncing me It's rotten for so long But my heart can sing this song I thank you for fighting my battles for me Now I need your father, cause Satan wants revenge He is angry because he lost his place in heaven He lies, he tries to bury me with no company But he's gonna get me if you're not with me oh Jesus I tried I tried I tried to do this one all by myself so pointless now I need your help to tell him get me high Jesus come arrest me
