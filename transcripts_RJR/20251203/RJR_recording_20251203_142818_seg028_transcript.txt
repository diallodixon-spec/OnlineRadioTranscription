Yes, I was crashing into love Oh, of all the words you sang to me About life, the truth and being free Yeah, you sang to me Oh, how you sang to me Girl, I live for how you make me feel So I question all this being real Cause I'm not afraid to love For the first time I'm not afraid of love Oh, this day seems made for you show me what life needs to be you sang to me oh you sang to me all the while you were in front of me I never realized I just can't believe I didn't see it in your eyes I didn't see I can't believe it oh but I feel it when you sing to me
