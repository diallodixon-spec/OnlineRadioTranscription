It was like they were Before I let you in I got to get to know you first My love, love Can't just give you my love My love, love So sweat sweat for it Love, love Baby girl Can't just give me my love My love Can't just give you my life. All right, then I'm under. Baby, girl, we're not gonna fight, because you're absolutely right. You're too precious to me to only love you for the night. The feelings that me feel for you, you know that you're my type. Make my life shine bright, ready to sign the dotted line. I know you're anxious, you want me to touch it, girl.
