20251216 202913 I'ma have you singing songs like Haley, Haley, Bailey. No, no, this nigga ain't family. You a girl from the block. And every man want a boy can't get it. But anyway, the party, they're right, they may get it. Come for your fun, take a day and you're done. But you're not anymore. Sound city, right here, with difference. With a difference. Venomous, look into stuff. Not true, me just come, me dangerous. But the one you're risking, when you waste time and go down like a gypsy, come with me to the site, site, site. City, the rain and dust, till all is knocked and pop out, you're supposed to be still ready. And I'm like, I can't feel you. I know my thoughts, you're my monster, but you got to be the same as me, gotch. Big bumper on the side.
