How does the price of the, you know, sorrel extra compare to buying sorrel in the marketplace? Is it cheaper? Is it more affordable? What's going on? It's more affordable. Definitely. We're definitely thinking about, we want our customers to know that we're thinking about their pockets just the same. It has to be cost effective. Now, if you should, sadly, because of the recent passing of Hurricane Melissa, majority of our farms got affected. And with that being said, we're probably in a solar crisis. Now, with that, solar did go up by a huge margin. In comparison to that, you're spending way less, 50%, 80% less than what you would buy within the market. Right. So to give you some perspective, if you were supposed to purchase a pound of sorrel at the market, that can give you about a liter, a liter and a half of sorrel that is like, you know, the Pepsi bottle.
