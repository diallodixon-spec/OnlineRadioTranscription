20251231 171207 remains helping people rather than rebuilding structures. The response follows comments from Member of Parliament Everett Warmington, who questioned the allocation and suggested the funds should instead be redirected to housing and other social needs. Religious leaders say the criticism misunderstands how churches have operated since the hurricane, noting that many congregations have been focused on providing shelter, food and support to displaced families. They say while government assistance is welcomed, any support directed through churches will first be used to help members and communities repair homes and replace damaged roofs. Church representatives also rejected suggestions that congregations are wealthy, pointing out that many churches are financially strained while continuing to provide social support. The $75 million allocation was announced as part of post-hurricane recovery efforts across most of the affected parishes.
