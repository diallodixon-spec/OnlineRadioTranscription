If you lie out to me, we'll lie out to you. Love is a game. Baby, I'm not playing for love. This night's like ice and teeth. Cooler than the island beach. This is the first time I smell your feet. Only when I say I love you, sir. This is like ice and teeth, cooler than the island beach, this is the first time Oh I wanna fly, just in the sky
