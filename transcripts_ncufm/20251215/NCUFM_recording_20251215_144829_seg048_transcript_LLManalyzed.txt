20251215 144829 UFM 91.1 91.3 and 91.5 have passed your way and you're all washed out cause it rained on your parade seems nobody cares about you anyway now you're living your life like a castaway search for strength inside was it all in vain cause the deeper you dig you find more and more pain don't let your tomorrow be like yesterday cause I spoke to God I called out your name and on your behalf I just ask if he would be there for you. I want you to be blessed. Don't live life in distress. Just let go, let go. He'll work it out.
