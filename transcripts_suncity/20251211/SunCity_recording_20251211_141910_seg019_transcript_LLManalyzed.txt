I never knew love till there was you From the bottom of my broken heart You promised yourself but to somebody else And you made it so perfectly perfect Still I wish you were here From the bottom of my broken heart There's just a thing, a thing or two You gotta know that you were my first love First love, you were my true love From the first kisses to the very last row From the bottom of my broken heart
