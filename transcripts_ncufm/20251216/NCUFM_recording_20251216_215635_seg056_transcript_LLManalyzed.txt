20251216 215635 Daniel was first that the princes might give accounts unto him, and the king should have no damage. The word of the Lord. Or tonight, once again, as we examine scriptures, even in the light of our present conditions, the happenings in our country, the disaster, tonight, may someone in authority hear this account. May someone who's set over tens and hundreds and thousands, may someone who is a major steward take note of this. May for many years, you might have been in an office, for many years you might have been an assistant, an associate somewhere, but now based on the circumstances, you have reached a prominence. Remember, ultimately, the account that should be given of you and your work is that there should be no damage. The text actually says that a king should have no damage. Now, I'm not referring to the political well-being of the Prime Minister.
