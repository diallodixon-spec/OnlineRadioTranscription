Now don't look so sad at the party Forget your troubles until tomorrow Don't be upset at the party, baby Whenever you're ready Hold my hand when you're ready Let me rock, rock, rock with me, baby. Rock, rock, rock rock with me baby. Rock, Rock, rock with me baby Rock with me girl. Rock with me girl, rock with me girl. Swingin' my love, my love my love. Now don't look so sad in the party. Forget your troubles until tomorrow. Don't be upset in the party, baby. Whenever you're ready. Hold my hands when you're ready. Let me rub, rub.
