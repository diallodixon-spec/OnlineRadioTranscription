20251230 195325 I know you're gone, me feel the pain The love remain that will never change It make me sad when me hear your name Cut me up, you no there again now One thing me know, me nah go hide my feelings Got no, just the memories And I'm living with the memories We still a question, father. People a tell me no bother. Light up a split full a corner. I reminisce when this trouble ready to a week or so. Me nah go forget you and you know. I know today, I know yesterday we grow. From my blue and black shorties till it rain.
