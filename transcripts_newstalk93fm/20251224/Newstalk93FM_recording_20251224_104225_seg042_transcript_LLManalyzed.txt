20251224 104225 In my bed with my head to the ceiling Stay I'm drowning alone and I'm lost in my feelings Somebody send me a sign cause you know that I need it Can't even come back to me, cause you know you're my healing. I said it's okay, it's my therapy, therapy, my therapy. It took away all of my anxiety, anxiety, my remedy.
