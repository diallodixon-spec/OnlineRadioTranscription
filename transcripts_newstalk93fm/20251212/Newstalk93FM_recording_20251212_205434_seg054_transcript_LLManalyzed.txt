20251212 205434 Oh, gosh. But everybody's trying to talk to me, and nobody's trying to hear me out. So you've got some things to say, and this week is just a movie mount. The things you say, it makes no sense. I'm in out of time to figure it out. Leave me alone. It's best you just leave me out. See, what I'm trying to say is that this caused me so much pain Feeling like I've got no control over my own brain When it's sad to see that you don't see it's driving me insane Leave me alone, oh yes Right, I know enough for them to get black and delete You're playing mode out the life you're so sweet Come and bring off me line, seven days at the week I'm enough for right now, I'm enough for sleep Leela beg you this, Leela beg you that Shut your shh, cut the crap
