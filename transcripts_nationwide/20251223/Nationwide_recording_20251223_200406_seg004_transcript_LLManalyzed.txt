20251223 200406 talk about this evening. I agree with you George and and you know usually before we come to this program to talk to the nation about a particular topic George we would sometimes refresh our memories all the time George and we look at journals and studies all of them refer to it as as leg cramps you're absolutely right there's no big name for it they refer to it as leg cramps the They refer to it as leg cramps. The listeners refer to it as a leg cramps. Your producer did ask you, Latoy, to ask the nation some of the topics they wanted to discuss. And this is a very common one, George. And so we're responding to the nation tonight. Excellent. You know, it may seem like a trivial thing, but Jamaicans on the whole have trouble distinguishing between their leg and their foot. So there'll be a cramp in the foot, there'll be cramp in the leg, but for Jamaicans it's all just leg cramp. Once the cramp is anywhere from the hip to the toe, they say foot.
