20251231 191010 We're talking about managing diabetes and we recognize that diabetes is a condition that is widespread more so than we even can consider and there are persons out there who are managing this disease very well. Others may not be managing as well. We also have caregivers who are burdened with persons who they must give that necessary care to because they don't want them to pass out on them or they don't want to die or they want to have their lives being extended. So we want to just give a shout out to all the caregivers out there who are caring for, it could be a mother, father, sister, brother, some family members, to our healthcare workers who are also caring for persons with diabetes. We also have several diabetes educators here in Jamaica, pharmacists alike, and we want to give a shout out to all of those persons this morning. Our guest today is Dr. Andrea
