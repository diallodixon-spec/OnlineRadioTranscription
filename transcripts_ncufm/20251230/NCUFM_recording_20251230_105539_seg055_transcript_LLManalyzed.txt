20251230 105539 There are days when I don't pray And from God's words I stray I forget about God And I make Him sad But He loves me in spite of me I have cheated and lied and feel guilty inside I have gone my own way yet he's still on me today. Cause he loves me in spite of me. Yes he loves me, in spite of me, oh he loves me.
