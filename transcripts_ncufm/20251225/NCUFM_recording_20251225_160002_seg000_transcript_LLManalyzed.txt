20251225 160002 Christmas Day, last year. Sorry, you used the Lord's name in vain. On Christmas Day? You were golfing. Oh. Now sir, if you'll just stand over that trap door. Wait, wait, wait. What about June 1st this year? I'm sorry, you had covetous thoughts. June 2nd? Covetous thoughts. 3rd? Covetous Thoughts. 4th? 5th? 6th? Listen, there's a two-month period you can forget about when your next-door neighbor bought a new car. Oh, come on, guy. Can't you give me a break? You were given a break. Jesus died to pay the penalty of your sins for you. However, you never acknowledged Him as Lord of your life, and now you must pay that penalty yourself. Could you move left a little? Here? Thank you. Another message from Lifeline Productions, the comic strip of radio at lifelinepro.com.
