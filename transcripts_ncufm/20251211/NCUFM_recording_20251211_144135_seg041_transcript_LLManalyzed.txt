potential but a heart full of tears plant anyway your faith is not going unnoticed God sees God knows God remembers and God will bring a harvest in this perfect time let's talk to God together dear father some days we still push through and we still have to try to carry out our daily tasks Lord Lord, I'm begging you, please strengthen us. Strengthen the drive time family. Somebody is listening today and that one day is today for them. They're in a situation and they're trying to carry out the daily tasks but their mind is elsewhere because of the problems and the struggles and the hardships that face them. But thank you God for promising that our tears are not wasted. Strengthen our heart to keep sowing even when it hurts. Turn our sorrow into a future harvest of joy and let our faith grow strong.
