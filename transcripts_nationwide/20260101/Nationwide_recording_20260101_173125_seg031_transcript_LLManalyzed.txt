20260101 173125 I listened to before I swear You've taught me everything I know Can't imagine needing someone so But through the years it seems to me I need you more and more Through the years Through all the good and bad I know how much we had I've always been so glad to be with you Through the years, it's better every day You've kissed my tears away As long as it's okay I'll stay with you Through the years Through the years
