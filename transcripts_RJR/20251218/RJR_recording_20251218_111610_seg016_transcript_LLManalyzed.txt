20251218 111610 You are right next to the river, right next to Manshag House. How far the river come up during the hurricane? It come right up and cover the house. You feel house? Manshag House, the house next door me. Manshag House is about not even 80 meters from the river. And you are right next door. It didn't come up to your yard. It come up right in the margin near to me but it never come in my house. But it come in Manshag house right through. Cover in a hit. But from I live down here, every single major flood, even during Gilbert, Manshag house wash out. You have any idea what's going to happen in relation to that when we start rebuilding after this hurricane? I don't believe we will come back up that much. It takes a long time to come up there. Long years, years, years before we see that again.
