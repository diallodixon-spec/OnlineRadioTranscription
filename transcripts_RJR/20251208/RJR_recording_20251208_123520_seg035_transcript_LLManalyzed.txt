my house is Hurricane Melissa to be removed. I'm living in an area called Playground Bamboo St Anne. I've also reported it to the St Anne Disaster Office but no response from Flow Jamaica. All right so if you could provide you have given you say where it is um so if you got does the poll have a number if you could look at at that, if you can see it, don't clam up there and get yourself into problems if it's at a place that is inaccessible. But if you can, if you can say what the number is on it, that could possibly help in pinpointing for them to respond to that. So if you could do that and send that as well, all right? And see if we can sort this one out for you. So Playground in Bamboo sent. And look at another one. This one says here, try and bring it up. Okay. Let's remind you of the numbers in the middle. 8, 7, 6, 9, 2, 6, 2, 1, 7, 8.
