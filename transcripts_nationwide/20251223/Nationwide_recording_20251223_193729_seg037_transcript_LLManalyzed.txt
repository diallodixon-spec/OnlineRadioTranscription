It would have to be Harris Chung, Dr. Harris Chung, and Dr. Andrew Wholeness, because I'm telling you, Mr. Wholeness has went through a lot and survived. And I hope the people of Jamaica who criticize him, take a lesson of this. You cannot condemn somebody who got appointed. You cannot. So I hope they will take a lesson of that. He has went through a lot and he survived. And I thank Dr. Chang for what he has done and the Commissioner of Police. Right? And one last person I want to big up is Errol from Mandeville. He always tries to help me out, you know, as a person who is unable to do certain things. I'm very, very grateful to them and God bless you all and have a good Christmas.
