20251217 130104 There's no one like you Who can touch like you Or heal us like you do We stumble and we stray Till you always get us through Who makes all things new? And comes to our rescue Death, hell and the grave They could not conquer you He came just like me To unlock and set free This prisoner that was seen to me Who did it redeem? The me I could not see Everybody wanna be like you They want power and grace like you But see, there is no God There's no one like you
