I don't want to be alone tonight It's pretty clear that I'm not over you I'm still thinking about the things you do So I don't wanna be alone tonight Alone tonight, Alone tonight Can you fight the fire? I need somebody who can take control I know it's not the one I need to do Cause I don't want to be alone tonight, Along tonight, Alone tonight Look what you made me do I met somebody new Ooh baby, baby, I'm dancing with a stranger Look what you make me do
