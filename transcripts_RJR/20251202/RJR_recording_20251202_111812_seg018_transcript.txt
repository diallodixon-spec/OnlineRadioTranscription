And of course, just reflecting on the WhatsApp message that came from Salah, I think you're speaking about Kathmandu, I suspect, the protests on Nepal that was started and created, there was a political crisis emanating from social media. All right, so things really Kathmandu naturally referencing, okay. All right, that's also happening in Bangladesh in 2024. So, it's used that uprisings aren't something to scoff at, they can happen, and misinformation too can start it. So what can I tell you on this information? I remember also a WhatsApp I read, the person was asking, no doubt in relation to what I said where criminal life is concerned, what are the options, what happens there for a person set out to create like mayhem with misinformation or disinformation.
