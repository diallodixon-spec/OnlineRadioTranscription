20251222 160707 I'll make it It's roads long, but I never give up, no Roads heavy, but I never gave up, no Never give up, no, never give up The roughest and the toughest of times I was able to endure Keep climbing, trust your reward is sure I believe, oh, I believe All of my blessings I'm bound to receive. I believe, oh, I believe, John gave me favors so I will achieve. Even in the valley, I shall not go. Because I know my God is here. Oh, even when I lose my strength, I will not despair.
