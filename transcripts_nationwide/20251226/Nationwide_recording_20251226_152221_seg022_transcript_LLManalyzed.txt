20251226 152221 Oh, in my life There's been part of your pain I don't know if I can face it again Can't stop now I've traveled so far Changed this lonely life I want to feel what love is I want you to show me I wanna feel what love is Feel what love is And I know you can show me Show me We were cool back in high school, ooh, I really liked you Must have been the best day of my life
