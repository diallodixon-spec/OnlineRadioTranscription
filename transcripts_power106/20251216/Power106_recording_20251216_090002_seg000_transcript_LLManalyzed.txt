20251216 090002 The whole world feels a little bit more love when Christmas comes When Christmas comes and everywhere that you go People sing and let it snow and hang You're listening to Power 106 FM. The time is now 9 o'clock. Feels a little bit more love When Christmas comes When Christmas comes And everywhere that you go There's people singing like it's snow And hanging up that mistletoe And me and you gonna have ourselves a hot love day
