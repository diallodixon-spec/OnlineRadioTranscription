victory in their UEFA Champions League encounter at the Bernabeu on Wednesday. Real had actually taken the lead in the 28th minute through Brazilian international Rodrigo before City rallied with goals from Nico O'Reilly in the 35th minute and early in Holland with a 43rd minute penalty as Pep Guardiola's side got their European campaign back on track following last month's a shock loss to Bayer Leverkusen. A big, big night for his manager, and a big night in the Champions League. It's been allowed to travel a long way, it's a good save, and it's turned in! It was Cardiol's header, and then the man on the spot for Manchester City was Nicole O'Reilly. His first ever Champions League goal called to our wake.
