20260102 151009 good afternoon sir you know sir I have learned over the years that one of the most expensive commodities on earth is human beings yes true plenty people don't know that it is happening now as you may know in Africa and other parts yes and it's happening even here what I'm call human trafficking they must buy and sell people every day, everywhere. Maybe we should get back in the business. Yes! Because what do we do now? Nothing. We're not producing nothing. We're not growing nothing. We are not farming. All of our food, all of our food, the supermarkets are filled with foreign food. There's no food here. Right. That's true. So we need to do something about our poverty. Yes, we do. So these young men running around shooting guns, could we put them in slavery? Oh, well, you know, slavery in itself is wrong.
