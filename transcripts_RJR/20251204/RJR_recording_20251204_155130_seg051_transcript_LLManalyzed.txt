family. We have a family. We can't help it. We do my best. We say, what's your name? Well, you know what? You're a really terrible. Yeah. Yeah.

If they try to have a normal life, people are head clambage of them. If they say, well, all right, I don't have a normal life. I'm going to have an abnormal life like my parents. People are head clambered. Like they are so cruel. Yeah. Yeah. Really, really cruel. And I mean, I think it's something they intend to do. But I don't think they're going to do a self-check. So they don't know what to say a normal life and so do we.
