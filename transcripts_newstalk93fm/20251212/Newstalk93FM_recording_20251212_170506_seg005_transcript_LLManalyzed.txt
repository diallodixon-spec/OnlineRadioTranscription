Then drop it lower. Then walk it slower. Watch me in your red view mirror. Go, go, go! Y'all, you are the greatest. You'll always be my favorite. No matter what we face it, don't worry biggest stages. We on the road to greatness, y'all. In one because in a ceiling, darling. In town, it's traffic jam. All that's wrong is a traffic jam. Right now, you need traffic jam. Girls bright and early. Monday morning. Tuesday evening. Bump out the fender. Traffic jam, bump out the fender, traffic jam. Monday morning.
