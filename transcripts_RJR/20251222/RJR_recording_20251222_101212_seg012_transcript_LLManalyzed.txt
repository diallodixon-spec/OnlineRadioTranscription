That, that is the response that really solves the very issues you're raising. Persons will decide, for instance, there's someone who will decide that they just want to cover it and do what they want. There are others who, like yourself, are giving. All right? Now, in terms as an institution, I'm sure that if you're going to say, listen, if you want to enjoy yourselves, that's it, but don't put the spend, don't expect government to spend for you to do that. It is better that government uses that money to help those persons who need the help. You see what I'm saying? Right? So that doesn't mean that you're not able to enjoy yourself, but it must be at your own expense. Yes, but they were set up to be better heartless. You can't be enjoying yourself on somebody else. They're hungry.
