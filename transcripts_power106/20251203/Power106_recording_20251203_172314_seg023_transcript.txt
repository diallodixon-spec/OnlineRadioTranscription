air to an internal combustion engine, you're going to need more fuel. Timing also is critical, and so those three things is what makes your turbocharged engine last long and produce the most power and torque. What are the advantages, Shelley, of running a turbocharger versus a non-turbocharger? Let's just put two similar engines together. Both of them are going to be the same 2.5 liter engine. One is going to be naturally aspirated, meaning it has no turbocharger, and one is going to be turbocharged. The power that you're going to get from this naturally aspirated engine, for argument's sake, is probably 140 horsepower. And you would probably get somewhere in the region of probably 150 foot pounds of torque there about depending on the design of the engine the engine now that is fitted with a turbocharger and is properly tuned depending on the size turbo we now can see
