============================================================

I went away every day It's just a cloudy day And I don't know if it's rain from the sky Tears from my eyes falling on my face And rolling down my cheek Dance it! Dance it! Let me be your one and only one with just one kiss. Stop the rain from the sky. Peace from my eyes falling on my face.
