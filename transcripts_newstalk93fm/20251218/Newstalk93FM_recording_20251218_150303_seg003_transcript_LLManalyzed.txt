20251218 150303 I'm on the ground, not causing trouble Look how the security watch me, they don't know I'm out there At this much of a place, and at this place, like I'm jumping I don't wait, they don't want me in their party there They don't want me cause I do one way They don't want in their party there I don't listen, nothing to say Every time a drug Jumpin' up Doin' what I want Jumpin' up Tell them I ain't livin' Right there's too much action Somebody pour a nexon Until my head gone And I'm miserable All down on the ground
