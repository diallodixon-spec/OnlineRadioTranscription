No, but you won't let me Can me You upset me, girl And then you kiss my lip And all of a sudden I forgive That I was upset I can't remember what you did But I hate it You know exactly what to do So that I can't stay mad at you For too long, that's wrong But I hate it You know exactly how to touch So that I don't want to fuss and fight no more So now this fight's gotta you throw you But I hate how much I like you
