from your lips you just don't forget that I love to skimmy-skim a quick skit that's your game that I'm not up to please can you lay my brain? night is young so I'll meet let's get to know each other better slow and easily take my hand let's take the floor shake Shake your body to the music, baby, and you fall. So come on, baby, let's just show some slack. Why you wanna move so fast? We don't have to take our clothes off to have a good time. Oh, no. We could spend the night, all night. If we could get a ride, uh-huh. Let's slow it down. You want me? A man wants to be as old-school and romantic as me.
