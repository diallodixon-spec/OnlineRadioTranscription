And she done and I get it Said you stand, you wanted my name and you left So I'm guessing that you never meant it Said you trying hard, I'm gonna lose So strong now I'm standing alone in this kitchen Singing sad songs, but I'm knowing that this don't last long If you leaving then leave, cause your baby go and leave me all the way don't ask for all your things back cussing out my name yeah just to go and take back what you say. Burn all the bridges, don't ask forgiveness. Walk away like I'm someone you hate. Don't let me down easy. If you're gonna leave me, baby, go and leave me all the way. If you say that you don't have no take back, I said you fell out of love and I hate that.
