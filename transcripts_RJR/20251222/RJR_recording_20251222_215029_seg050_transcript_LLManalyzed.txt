20251222 215029 My sweet, I am not afraid. Not anyone, not like before. Don't you understand me? Come on and please hold yourself. Together we're gonna do it very soon. My heart's on fire. Come on and take me up in what you make me, my darling, my sweet. Oh, pretty baby, you make me feel so good. Let me take you by the hand. Come let us visit out there in that new promised land. Maybe there we can find a good place to keep our love and stay fond. I'm so crazy about love, never knowing what love's all about. Geez, will you come on in, man? You can blow now if you want to live through.
