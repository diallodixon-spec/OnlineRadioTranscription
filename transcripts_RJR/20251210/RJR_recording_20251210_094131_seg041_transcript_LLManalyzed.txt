I want them to know that you are not vulnerable. You know what your rights are. You know what to look out for. So we need you to be proactive. We need you to be alert. We have concerns as it relates to home repairs because you're hearing anecdotal stories about the prices of hardware items going sky high. Yep. And you know, as I said, anecdotal. Because the reports aren't coming in, right? Right. So until they come in, they remain anecdotal. So what we're encouraging our consumers, if you engage a contractor, do not pay the full price upfront. Do not do it. You pay in stages, okay? Always get a written agreement.
