So from there, I was able to connect a lot of farmers to their family overseas and to know that they are alive in certain places. What I had to do was to navigate these difficult paths and treacherous road to find branches and branch members to connect them to their families and know that they were in safe. Wow, now that sounds like quite an energetic undertaking, Mr. Sherman. It was difficult. Some of the roads have to tread in nights and to assist some farmers in different areas and to find their losses. I am a farmer myself and I undergoasses myself too. And it was heartbreaking when I entered your farm and you look and when you reach you see some of your pens, some of the zincs and pens down by the gate. I was on the road the next day visiting another farmer and my farmer said to me, boy, Mr. Sherman, how are things? Do you have any water?
