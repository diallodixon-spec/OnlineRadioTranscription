20251224 162423 service ends about nine PM. I can't recall being at church up until 12 o'clock. So once again, our question of the day is, what's your New Year's Eve tradition? We have some comments over YouTube, Nora. So I'll start from the end and you can start from the top. Rick JamnyC says, I've never been to the New York City Countdown in the crossroad of the world. And here since 2008, don't think I will unless the temperature is in the 70s. That is something that I've also said I would never attend. I just feel like I don't see too much people. I think think the worst yeah that's that you know the middle of times square with the people yeah yeah if you're not if you're if you're not a crowd person it's not the place to be i can't imagine oh anxiety that taking another crowd day um rick jam nyc
