20251217 145441 It's brought to you in time, made available for government broadcasts. Welcome to another edition of Inside the OUR, a production of the Office of Utilities Regulation. I'm Daniel Pasley. In today's episode, JPS and the NWC will waive service charges for customers still without electricity or water since Hurricane Melissa. And in our Ask Lorna segment, with Nicole Morgan-McCain, the OER advises a customer who was not severely affected by Hurricane Melissa but has been experiencing major internet disruption since the storm. More details to come after this short break.
