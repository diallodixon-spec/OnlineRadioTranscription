20251224 162827 I just want to make sure that for the past couple of years, I'm inside. If I'm ever going to go outside, I would rather to go outside after 12 o'clock strikes and then go out the door. Because I don't play the game with my life. So, Jerome, as a DJ now, when New Year is in your book now, what time do you read through them on them things? For New Year's Day? Probably like about 7 o'clock in the morning. 7 o'clock. Yeah, because I'm not going to the road. It's so hard. So normally, I would leave church at 12.30. Probably one of the latest. New Year's Eve Christmas is in the morning right?
