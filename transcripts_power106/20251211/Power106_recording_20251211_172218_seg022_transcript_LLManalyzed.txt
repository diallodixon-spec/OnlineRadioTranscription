Obviously, the industrial situation has gotten worse and worse. If we look at the climate side of this, the government in Berlin says we still want to stay on this path. We just want to sort of loosen the path there to 2035. Couldn't car makers, however, just continue building combustion engine cars, saying that, for example, these technologies like e-fuel, synthetic fuels will save them and then move away from making attractive battery electric vehicles. Is that the danger in this kind of agreement? Yeah, I think in the long run battery electric vehicle will definitely dominate the market and all German car manufacturers are well aware of that. But obviously they need more time for this transformation.
