20251231 162216 I put my feelings on safety So I don't go shootin' way R.I.P. Cause you take the bullet tryna save me Then I'm left to do what making you believe And that's all I've learned, ain't tryna waste it Like we be runnin' the mile and never make it That's just too bitter for words, don't wanna taste it There's too bitter for words don't wanna face it But I think that I'm done trippin', I'm trippin', trippin' I've been sippin', that's how I control it Feel you keep sippin', you keep on gettin' hit, ooh, oh Baby, if your love is too good to be true Baby, boy, your love got me trippin' on you You know your love is big enough to make me hurt before you Yeah, it's big enough, got me tripping on you Trippin', trippin', on you My bad, my bad, boss, trippin' o' you Trippin' on o' you My bad, bad, my bad boss, tripping o' you
