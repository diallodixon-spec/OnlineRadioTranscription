20251217 130506 good at talking but horrible leaders just saying as a country we should not praise failure or mediocrity not now or in the past or in the future why we've been stagnant as a country for so long but here's what you did we are referencing somebody who is operating as a minister of finance now whose performance just recently in the Parliament was nothing short of shocking and shockingly disappointing for those who have not been watching her performances over the years in various ministries, Ministry of Education and now Ministry of Finance. To any objective objective observer she has been poor. Your only point of reference because you want to make a political point and this is a nonsense that has stagnated us as a country which you refer to.
