20251216 182422 We are trying to see if we can recruit those players so we can have a pool of players to draw from. And the aim is to improve on our coaching delivery. We are currently in position where we are recruiting coaches. We would like to have a high-performance coach to help to take us to the next level. I think even though we're a small island, we have several number of persons or students or persons on the island who could possibly help us to go to number 10, within the number 10. That is what I would love to see over a period of time. I cannot tell you what the timeline is, but it's not going to be this year or probably next year, but there's a lot of work that we will need to do in order to get to that level.
