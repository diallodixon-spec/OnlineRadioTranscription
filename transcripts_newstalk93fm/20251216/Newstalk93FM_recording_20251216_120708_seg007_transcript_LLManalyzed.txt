20251216 120708 So tell me if you want action Until the light's back on I got the one we could last long I don't even know my time Girl, like what I waited for lifelong I pull up in my high fashion Every night that shit in any way We can go ahead and just head out And chill up in my villa, take it out the whole night. Just get in the drop top, take the head out and cruise with your head outside. Go ahead, it's your time baby. It's your time baby, get by baby. That's the difference when you're my baby. That's how it is when you. Nobody make me stop the world So tell me what do we do when these people don't know what you been through You survive through the night
