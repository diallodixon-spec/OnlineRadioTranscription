20251215 140811 Tomorrow people, how long did you last? Today you say, today ah. Tomorrow say you're gone, but you're gone so long. If there is no love in your heart, oh sorry, then there is no hope for you. Tomorrow people, where is your best? Tomorrow people, how long will you last that next? Solar in the air, so much you still don't have a thing to spare Your flying eyes, while we're on the loop Tomorrow people, where is your best?
