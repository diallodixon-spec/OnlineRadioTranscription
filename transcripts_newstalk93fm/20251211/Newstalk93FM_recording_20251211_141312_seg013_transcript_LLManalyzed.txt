I see she step and she tiptoe And well you know how the ting is grown She knows by the winter But just with this over me Have me begging on me knees Want me spend me salary, baby Granny say, yeah Boy, don't twist up your head down there They gon' knock out your teeth and put your ass in bed But I don't care, nah Cause I you're like craving it I want some somebody that duped you, darling. Sweet this when it a rolling, rolling, loop-back when it a rolling rolling, things nice when it a rolling-rolling, and I love how we feel it.
