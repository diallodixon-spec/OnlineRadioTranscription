Just stop think for a while I can't breathe I'm a parent someone's child. I can't breathe. I Just don't want to leave just let me breathe I have much more to give You're sleeping too long open your eyes the more your interest the more we rise Your wicked habits have been for ages To write those pictures, I can't Please stop think for a while I can't breathe Please stop thinking for a while I can't breathe I'm a parent, someone's child I can't breathe, I just don't wanna live
