20251218 111006 thing with the staff from the Police, Civilian and Oversight Authority is that they are super, super talented. So you're going to get to experience one of the super talented team members as they come forward with a musical item. Please put your hands together for Grant as he comes forward to give us some musical renditions. And I see him have some makeup team down there, wipe off the sweat. So you know he's a superstar coming around. Keep that applause going until he hits the stage. Alright, we're going to take a break and come back with more from the National Police College.
