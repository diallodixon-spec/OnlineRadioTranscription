20251216 090203 I don't know if everything is real, but I know for a fact I know every man real. You have to feel it, you have to know it. You have to understand. Get me? Just remember when you break, I'm trying to fling in the dirt Don't leave a pain in my ass, like in my shirt Long before I took the chance and the thing didn't work, I did not sell Man, I'm king in the head, yeah, I'm never drop the game, the whole city alert Long before I stalked the millions, got pittin' in the flood
