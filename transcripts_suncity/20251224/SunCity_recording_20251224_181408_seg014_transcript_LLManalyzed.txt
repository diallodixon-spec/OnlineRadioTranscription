20251224 181408 Thank you Reggae Wednesday. You never said you were sorry. It was just the other day. You told me you were sorry, it was not so long ago. We talked about the same thing. Darling, why? Please tell me why Do numbers behave in such a way? Didn't you know that love means Never to say that you're sorry
