20251218 114124 John Brown. He knows John Brown and he knows that it's John Brown car. So I moved the car from Bay Farm Road, carried it to Portmore. Carried it to Portmore on a different spot. Moved the car to Shway and I could drive it. Until it stayed. Paid on it and you can't come pick it up Friday. Friday when you go, nobody's gonna know him. No car's gonna be there again. This is the same place where you went to them. No car is there because them already them already get they got the money that they want some care I don't care I'll put it back we're we're John Brown in the car which is at his house so this car never belongs to anyone in the first place and I tell you something you know them take off all license plates you know saying oh my gosh yes yeah man they're taking off one arrival for show you so they can't really sell so they might tell you say may i say may i send you the documents online these are some fictitious documents that don't exist so
