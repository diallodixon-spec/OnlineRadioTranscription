Psychological support is also important so you can manage that stressful condition that's happening right now. It could be a death of a friend, a death of a mother, a death of her father, a sister or brother. It could be other financial challenges that you're having. It could be that you were affected by the storm and you're not sure where you're going to be living or how you're going to live and whether or not you're gonna be able to build back the house that is damaged, et cetera.
