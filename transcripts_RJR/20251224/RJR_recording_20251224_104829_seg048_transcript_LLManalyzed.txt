20251224 104829 Good morning, is this Dr. Taylor? It still is. Dr. Taylor, I'm calling from Montego Bay. And I'm calling, I don't know if you can help me through or walk me through this. I'm calling pertaining to my light bill JPS had sent me. They disconnect my light from the 28th of October. And I did not get my current until the 18th of December, which was last week, Thursday. And they sent me a bill on my phone for $17,783 something. And I'm supposed to pay that the 5th of January. So I would like to know how can I pay a bill for that money when I have no electricity almost one month and three weeks?
