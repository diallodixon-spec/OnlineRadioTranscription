But I tell you though, J.C., you know, the voice had to have a certain quality. No, you can't sing on cassette. You know, they would have to hear that type of quality in voice. It's not like you could go out to tune something or fix something. So I think those days, no, it had its challenges, but I believe it really helped to sift out. Great vocalist. Thank you. So that's what ended up being heard eventually after many, many hands and ears had it. It ended up at Jogged Studio and that's where I was first asked. Because as I said, you know, the idea was to get someone to sing the songs, not for me to record.
