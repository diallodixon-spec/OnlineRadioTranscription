Letting how I feel for you Thinking about those people And I know that in a thousand years I'd fall in love with you again This is the only way that we should fight This is the only where to go And if I lose your love I know I would die So you'll always be my baby We can make it shine We can take forever Just a minute at a time More than a woman More than a woman to me More than a woman Oh, my baby More than a woman to me More than a woman, more than a woman, to me
