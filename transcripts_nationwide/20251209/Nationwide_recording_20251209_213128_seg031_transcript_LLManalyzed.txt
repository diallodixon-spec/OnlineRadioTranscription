you know, start a committed relationship with a woman and what he's not going to do certain things, he's going to be loyal, whole nine hands. But the reality is you'll have a woman, specifically me, it doesn't have to be you, who grew up uptown, you know, showing to the best schools, you know, socializing with the upper echelon of society. And she'll be married to, let's just say, a normal. One of the Jones. Or one of her, you know? Yeah know yeah and she'll be there and you know she's like you know can't imagine I won't marry for so long and I'm just boring so I'm just dissing just that and one little spice I want you to draw for your draw for your apathic draw for your glorified arm they can't no raven as myself. You get me? And what you do? So what, I'm the drummer? Yeah? No, man. And I become, I become the sneaky. How you do it, brother? How the drummer just jump out of this album, sorry.
