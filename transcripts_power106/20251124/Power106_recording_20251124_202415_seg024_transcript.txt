and other needs of the people. So this year, we will partner again to respond to the humanitarian needs in Western Jamaica in three parishes which have been identified, focusing on three of the towns. We'll look at St. Elizabeth, Westmoreland, and St. James. So we'll work together to bring help as part of the Light of the World program in Western Jamaica. Thank you. Good evening. I'm Major Marlene Boachi Ajiman. I'm a part of the Divisional Leadership of Eastern Jamaica Division. Today, I am delighted to have the Church of the Latter Day Saints as one of our partners. Over the years, the Church of Latter Day Saints have helped greatly in providing humanitarian needs for the people of Jamaica.
