20251231 124229 Making my way downtown, walking fast Faces passing, I'm homebound There I'm back to your head, just making my way Making my way through the crowd I still need you, I still miss you And now I wonder If I could fall into the sky Do you think time would pass us by? Cause you know I'd walk a thousand miles If I could just see you If I could fall into the sky
