Oh, Clarence, in the records, guide me out of in-charge. Please, Judge, don't take me, walk beside me. All me see a fake and all me see enemy. But I know, Judge, you can't be walking beside me. I'm a lonely man on the thunder I'm a lone caroling And I'm a lone charge all along Every day I'm on the coo-coo and the bother man That's why I'm a choppy guy in the step Me, nah, nah, I'm better than so Please charge up, get me to walk beside me
