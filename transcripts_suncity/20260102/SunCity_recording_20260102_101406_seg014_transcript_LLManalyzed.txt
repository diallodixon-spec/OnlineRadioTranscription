But if call upon, as you can tell, I always make sure that I avail myself. So if I need to produce, I produce. If I need to host, I host. If I need create, I create. Anything that I am called upon to do, and I have the ability to do it I do it because I believe in that so thank you know so much for those who have been here before me because then I've been here long before me you know thank you so much for supporting throughout the year and definitely pretty I think it's more than one time I think a sales rep came to me and asked about the the karaoke thing as well so I think that is something that we can you know think about so
