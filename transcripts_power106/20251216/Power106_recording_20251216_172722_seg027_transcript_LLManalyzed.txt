EM Civic Golf said quote, default of five and a half seconds, zero to 60 is probably still too much for many drivers. Slower acceleration will improve range, too. And lastly, Mike McAllister had this idea. Rather, the initial tip-in should be moderate, and early acceleration should be designed to lessen risk and improve control. Well, it turns out China agrees with most of you. The country's Ministry of Public Security came out saying those initial reports were wrong. The regulation only applies to how torque is delivered at startup. It does not prevent cars from achieving faster times once additional driver inputs or performance settings are engaged. So thanks for all of your feedback.
