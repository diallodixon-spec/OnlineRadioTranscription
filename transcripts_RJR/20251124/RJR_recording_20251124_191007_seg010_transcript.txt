Sitting here in rainbow Got some time to search my soul Well, they're putting up resistance But I know that my faith will lead me on I don't know where life will lead me But I know where I've been I can't say what life will show me But I know what I've seen Tried my hand at love and friendship But all that is passed and gone This little boy is moving on Sitting here in limbo Waiting for the tide to flow
