20251215 185347 from Special Olympics and so on. So we have to get the right volunteers. So yes, we welcome everyone, but of course we're going to make sure we vet. But even those who are outside of the vetting process when we are finished, we are going to offer training. So we know persons come with their strengths and persons may have weak errors and we're going to train, train in customer service, train in the different sports. Because remember, we represent a lot of sports. When I see Sean Pearce from Archery, and he is so excited about this because, you know, we don't really know a lot about Archery in Jamaica, but through this, I'm sure a lot of persons are going to want to take part in volunteering in archery and these sports that may not be Olympic sports we don't have representatives yet but they will want to volunteer but they will also want to become members of these associations
