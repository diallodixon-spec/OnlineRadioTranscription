20260101 115727 Now I know there's many questions running through your mind You're wondering, have you found your love this time? Have you found the one who cares, who will always be right there? I wrote this song just to ease your mind Now your love, your love to me is very serious I won't play games with you tender heart And when I look into your eyes and say I love you girl That's how I feel, I'm for real They say in life you take a chance And in love there's no guarantees But the sweetest satisfaction comes from shaping our lives And tearing down the walls of mystery
