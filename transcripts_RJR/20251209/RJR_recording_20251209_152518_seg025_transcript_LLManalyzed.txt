============================================================

I'm trying to make things right Cherish these precious times Oh, just shine your light on us Show us the way to go Oh Lord, I put the family first. For better, for worse. Ooh-jah-jah, bless, let no man curse. I put the family, first. So sometimes it hurts. So glad we're together here on earth, we're here. After me care me baby, mother go a market. Me say me and me baby, Mother go a market.
