2025-12-11 23:22:25 What was I gonna do? I let your song You filled my heart with tears You gave me freedom You knew I could do when I heard your song. Fill my heart with peace and freedom. You knew I could not resist. I needed someone. And now we're flying through the stars. I hope this night lasts forever.
