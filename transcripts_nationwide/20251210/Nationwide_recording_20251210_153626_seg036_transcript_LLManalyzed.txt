Once I was seven years old, mama told me Go make yourself some friends or you'll be lonely Once I was 7 years old It was a big, big world, but we thought we were bigger Pushing each other to the limits We were learning quicker By eleven, smoking herb and drinking Never rich, so we were out to make that steady bigger Once I was eleven years old My daddy told me Go get yourself a wife or you'll be lonely Once I was 11 years old Told we'll be 30 years old Now songs have been sold We've traveled around the world and we still roam alone
