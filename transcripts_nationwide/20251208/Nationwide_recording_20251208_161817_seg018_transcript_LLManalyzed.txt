What is one dish that you enjoy, a local dish that you wish you could share with the world and why? I'd say Jamaica's national dish. Aki and sawfish. Absolutely. What advice would you give to young Jamaicans listening or watching right now who would like to pursue a career in the field of art? I'd say whatever you do, do what you love. In your career path, whatever it is, it may change as well over time when you get to know yourself more and I think that you should just do what you love and when you do that in and of itself it will be rewarding yeah well said I take that advice thank you so much it's been lovely having you on the show or we want to encourage you yes and we hope that in the future we can you know
