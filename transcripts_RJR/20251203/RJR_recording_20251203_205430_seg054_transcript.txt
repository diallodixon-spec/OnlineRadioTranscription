I'm drinking rum and Red Bull and you see you let me out full The more me get awful, like the more the dance all get grapple And I'm rum and Red Bull Drink! And you see let me out full, the more me get awful Like the more the dance, all get grapple I start the day with a flask, come bury with ice in a glass As a light, you'll find me me lost But me won't a liquor cause me am me won't burst Drink fi junk that me end us If you hide and drink, then you must be cut.
