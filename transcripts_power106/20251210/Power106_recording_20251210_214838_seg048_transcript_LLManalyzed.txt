============================================================

Did you know that we didn't have electricity down this side for almost four weeks after the storm? So there was no internet, there was no electricity. We couldn't even listen radio pass unless it's battery. And then now we couldn't get you on the app. I used to listen to you on the app, but the funny thing about it now, before the storm, I couldn't pick to say a blessing to these guys because, Pastor, my experience of that storm, I would never want to experience another storm like that, Pastor. Yes. Pastor, the thing was terrible, man. I actually got zinc lifting up on my room, pastor. Water coming in. It was terrible, pastor. But we give God thanks, pastor. It could have been worse.
