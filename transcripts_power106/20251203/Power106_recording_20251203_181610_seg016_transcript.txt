Alright, thanks for staying with us. We are having a conversation with Coach Charles Edwards. And I'm just perhaps with a fine point, Charles, on what we have been talking about. I don't know, but I think elsewhere in the world, in the footballing nations of the world, that the general populace would have an idea of who the players that will represent in the country in the next match would know. But I think we have not been lucky in that regard. We have absolutely no idea. Perhaps you can name maybe five who may make it onto the pitch at kick-off, Charles. Right, definitely.
