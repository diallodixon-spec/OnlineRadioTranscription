Stay on Tiktok. If you are dealing with negativity, avoid the WhatsApp line. We don't do that here, okay? Yeah, here is all about positivity, okay? Nonstop positivity. And that's what we promote on a Wednesday. Love and positivity. Well, actually Thursdays is when we promote love, but you know, reggae music is all about love, so we can't help it. We have to promote love as well. And I think that's something that we should promote every day, but you know, based on the themes here at Sun City, on a Wednesday, it's strictly reggae music, which is all about positive vibration, all right? On Thursdays, it's a Lovers Thursday, the hottest day upon radio. Now Sun City, you can only hear Sun City in about six parishes, and may I tell you, I'm telling you, no radio station is hotter than Sun City on a Thursday. Go do the maths, go do the maths. Maybe the other day then, but Thursday, nobody fooling here.
