20251229 153321 You have the results to show that you're not good. So even if you're saying you're good, we're looking on and saying, no, that's not true. And it's okay not to be good. So sometimes people say, I say, oh, I want to end the year on a high note. But what do they often get wrong about that idea of ending it on a high note? You know, when we say high note, we believe high note means doing everything perfectly. Like everything went well for you, you know. Nothing went wrong, but it's the opposite because it all went wrong, but you're still here and you're still resilient and you're still pushing past all those obstacles that you enter the year with and you are still ending with lessons that you have learned. Lessons that will travel with you for the rest of your life. I don't know if you did it in 2025 like me, but we learned some lessons in 2025.
