20260102 135333 Oh, my God, holding my feelings back. You got me all, loving all in my bed. And you got me all, you got me all in my bed, you got me in my bed all the time. She's got me all, oh, you got me all in my head. You got me in my head. Every time. The way you got me all in the head. You've got me all in your head. I think I'm better than you in my bed. Whatever it is, you know I can take it. I'm trying to dig in so many days, till I can see you again.
