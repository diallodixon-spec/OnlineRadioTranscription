Look at this great song Akuna Matata that Tadale mentioned earlier here. Here we go. When he was a cool young man. I worked in the colony paying my dues. Accepting without question the prevailing views. The young man's life was one long grind. Digging holes, standing guard, till it crossed my mind. I was wrong all along. All that I needed was to have needed a gold amatana. What a wonderful phrase.
