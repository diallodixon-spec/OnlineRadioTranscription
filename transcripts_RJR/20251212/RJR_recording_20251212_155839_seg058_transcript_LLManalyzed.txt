I'll play your game You heard me true and true But you can have your way I can't pretend each time I see you That I don't care and I don't need you But you never see me crying Though inside I feel like dying, oh baby I'll still do anything for you In spite of it all If that's what I should do To make you happy I can't pretend each time I see you That I don't care and I don't need you
