============================================================

How much I love you, I love you Pick up the phone, girl. Ice wind lock in, ice wind lock in. Ice wind lock in. Me and my twins do the most. Bomb, bomb, main thong on swimming in the cold. Hennessy, champagne, anything goes. We be doing squats on the yacht, ghosting. Summer on the ocean, no we ain't ghosting. We be ducked off, no internet posting. Me kids don't think I ain't no ghosting.
