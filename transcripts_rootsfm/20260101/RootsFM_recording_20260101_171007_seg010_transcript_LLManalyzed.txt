20260101 171007 So different and so new But like any other Until I kissed you And then it happened It took me by surprise I knew that you felt it too By the look in your eyes Sweeter than wine And softer than the summer night Everything I want I have Whenever I hold you tight This magic moment While your lips are close to mine We'll last forever Forever till the end of time I ain't much of Casanova Me and Romeo and Helen are friends
