20251217 151108 Welcome to the show. Thank you for choosing to share space, time and energy with us. We've got a great show for you today. It's hump day. We've made it to the amygdala of the week. Take some bleach. I'm grateful we can do this on repeat. I'm the stinger honeybee. He's the one DJ Jerome. I know you've got big dreams. You're the man with the plan. The yank to my yank. Stopping us not even if there's microphone jams. That's what I'm talking about. Now DJ Jerome, what do you have in store? Now before we get to you and your music, great show today. We've got a topic, okay, that we're going to be doing during the Weyusa segment, so go on over to Facebook, IGX, everybody just leave your comments there. But in the mix, you know it's Christmas time, it's the Yuletide season. It's a season when you know you get into the kitchen and you want to cook something nice for your family. Even if you're not a big chef, huh? So don't you worry! We have the creative and innovative Chef Bling in the building! He's gonna be on the show today, that is my resident chef on the Honey Pot Show, you guys don't want to miss it. He's gonna be giving you tips and giving you some recipes.
