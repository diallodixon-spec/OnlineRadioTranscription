So first I'm going to let you get some material, get you some proper pants and stuff like that. The pants are way up there. In terms of importance, yes. I want you to come here every Tuesday to the office and pick up your money for school for that week. So I did that, and I was doing that. At least now I had lunch money. I was able to get some of the books I needed. And then after about, maybe about a month and a half, I went back there. And at that point, you said, I don't think that this is going to work because I don't think the environmental conditions are conducive for you to do well. So he said I think the best thing is for you to come and live with me.
