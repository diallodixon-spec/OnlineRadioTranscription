20251230 114327 Trust me, as soon as you finish dealing with those, something else is going to come because the demand is there, people are suffering because they have not really a campaign to stay and to educate and take the time to get people out of their consumption habits. Well, the thing is, you know, the thing is that there are societies that are very serious when it comes to the trafficking of drugs, alright? Death sentences and so on. And one could argue that if you're talking about demand and I have to give you the trafficking, make it such a horrendous consequence that it's called the dent. The flip side of that is that it also will improve or extend in terms of the profit because it's the higher risk and the reward. I have to take a break. Hopefully I don't lose the connection.
