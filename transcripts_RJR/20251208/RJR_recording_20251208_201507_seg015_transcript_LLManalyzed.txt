Spirit moving He has touched me in my soul The love of God is more precious than gold And as for me and my house we will praise him He is worthy to be praised Don't you know, don't you know He can free you from your burden And cleanse you of your sin Just open your heart And let joy and peace within Take the name of Jesus with you Child of sorrow and of woe Don't you know, don't you know He will joy and comfort give you Now, now, child of sorrow and of woe Don't you know Don't you know He's the lily of the valley
