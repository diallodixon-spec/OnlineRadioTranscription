have to deal with that. Just a little bit of information that is very important in terms of how we navigate the rest of the afternoon here on both sides of the story. So we are having challenges with Digicel calls. If you have a Digicel phone and you also have a Flow phone, we're going to encourage you to use a Flow phone because if you try us on that Digicel might not be able to get through if you're calling us However, you can still send us whatsapp and text messages regardless of the phone that you have but we're having a challenge not of our doing with Accepting digital cause they have they have been working on it They continue to work on it. And as soon as situation is rectified we will advise you so you can call through to us however in the meantime if you have a flow phone please feel free to give us a call
