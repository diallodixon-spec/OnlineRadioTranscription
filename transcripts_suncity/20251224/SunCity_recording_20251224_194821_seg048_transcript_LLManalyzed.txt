20251224 194821 Wake up, don't you hear what I say Wake up, cause it's Christmas Day Cause I be rockin' in my shoes to the sweet reggae groove Ain't nobody gonna spoil my mood To this beautiful sunshine I'm risin' up Just a positive vibe me use and build me up Overflowing lightning hot coffee in a me cup Ain't no time for easin' up Yeah, Christmas on the corner!
