20251226 092314 I lose all control when I see you standing there in front of me Your style, your clothes, your hair, your hair woman, you look so sexy The way you whine and the way you dance and the way that you twist and turn your waist Leaves me wanting, leaves me yearning, leaves me feeling for a taste Before the end of the night. I want to hold you so tight. You know I want you so much. And I'm so tempted to touch. Tempted to touch, tempted to touch. I look at woman, I'm inside your clutch. Tempted touch, tempted touch. Look at woman, I need you. So much, tempted to touch, tempted. To all my ladies and gentlemen.
