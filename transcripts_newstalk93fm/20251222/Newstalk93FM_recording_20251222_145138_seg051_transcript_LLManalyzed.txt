20251222 145138 my mind running to the other side when it's time to leave my life then it tries to pick me up tell you what i need right yeah i that you cannot waste and the other one price that you cannot fix this is the peace that you cannot buy. Find it a way where you cannot see. Man with this system, he cannot pray. I need to find relief. But behind my mind it runs. All these thoughts have trouble me. Find it to give up my bed. Find it to be on my lane.
