20251218 193228 day today. I have to realize that it's not my battle. It's not my battle to fight. I'll let go when I let go I can let God let it pass Let God have his way That's when things start happening Things start happening I'll start looking at bad things Oh, when I let go, when I let God let him have his way. Let go, let God let go, and let God let go.
