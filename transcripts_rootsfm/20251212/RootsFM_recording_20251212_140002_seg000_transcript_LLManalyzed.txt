20251212 140002 Please, I'm not speaking from remembrance or experience. I did my homework. These are things that have. So, alright. So, while we continue speaking about how diverse our culture is and just how it brings people together, I want you to remember that there are still health services going on. The booths are still running. The food station is running. The Lions Club of Kingston is still doing their vision testing. Sacha Core Life is doing your numbers. ASHA is here ensuring you have your HIV testing so you know your status. The early childhood commission is here in their corner, and you can use their educational content because every child can learn, every child must learn, every child will learn. There will be no child left behind. All right, so we're ready, DJ String. Let's go.
