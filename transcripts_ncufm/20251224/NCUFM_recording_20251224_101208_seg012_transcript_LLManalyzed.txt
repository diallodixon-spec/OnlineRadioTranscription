20251224 101208 Because of your grace, we can't miss this race. The precious land of our dreams. Even when I broke your heart, my sins tore us apart. But I'm standing right here in the midst of all my tears Claiming you to be the lamb of God New life will begin But here wash away, wash away every one of your sins On the sun and set free You are free indeed You can claim him to be the Lamb of God
