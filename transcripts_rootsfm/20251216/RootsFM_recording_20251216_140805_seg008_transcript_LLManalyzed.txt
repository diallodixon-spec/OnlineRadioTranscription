20251216 140805 birthday links will be happening also. So if you read your like right now, are you feeling the moment? Are you feeling that particular mood? Next week will be Christmas. What exactly you'll be doing. I don't know what exactly I'll be doing, you know, because I am a person who just don't celebrate Christmas, seriously speaking. It's not a part of my growing up. But I'm gonna play a few Christmas songs for those who are deep in love with Christmas. I watch your face. In the meantime, it's all happening on Give It A Station station roots, the unstoppable radio station. I want to say good afternoon to Brittany. Yeah, more power to you, Brittany. Hope you're having a good time. And of course, gotta say good afternoon to Lukey. Yeah, more to you, Lukey. Have a blessed of the youngsters.
