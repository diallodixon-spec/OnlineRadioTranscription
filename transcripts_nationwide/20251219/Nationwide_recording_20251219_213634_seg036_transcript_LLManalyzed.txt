20251219 213634 are open at least in St. Elizabeth there's none open in St. Anne thank God that means that you know they've returned to normal as the mayor has confirmed but as regards or with regard to the people in St. Elizabeth to not be in your own home for Christmas it can't be easy can't be easy at all and I am really hoping the mayor said that they're making special arrangements. I'm really hoping that those special arrangements First of all come through and the two that it is somewhat enough to give some respite During this time. Yeah so trying to get in contact with Mayor Vernon to hear about their 16 days of Christmas and perhaps you know we should hear from Westmoreland Hanover as well
