20251216 104637 Attention pensioners paid by the accountant general's department, serving you is our priority. That's why the AGD will be open this weekend, Saturday December 20 and Sunday December 21 from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. to facilitate the collection of life certificates. For those who have not yet submitted your life certificate for the period October to December 2025, you may also drop it off at AGD's Dropboxes, located at Parish Libraries in St. James, Hanover, Westmoreland, Portland, and Manchester. If you have already submitted your life certificate for this period, there is no need to submit again. At the AGD, we're here to serve.
