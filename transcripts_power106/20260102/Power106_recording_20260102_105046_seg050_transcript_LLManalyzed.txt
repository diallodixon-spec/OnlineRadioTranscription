20260102 105046 And we now go to a multilateral head start. As we told you before, the flows of remittances or money sent back to Jamaica by Jamaicans living and working abroad, particularly in the United States, would shrink. This because of the high cost of living in that country and the racist immigration policies which are being pursued by the Donald, which make people afraid to even go to work, particularly those who have no papers. We are now in a situation that even those who have green cards are afraid to do this and this will be complicated by the 1% tax which became effective yesterday. The massive 8.3% tumble in these flows during the month of October of last year is an indication of what is to come during the rest of this year. Remittances are, unfortunately, 15.3% of GDP and the country's largest net source of foreign exchange, which is used to help to close the massive trade gaps and help to build a net international reserve, which are used to maintain the foreign exchange stability.
