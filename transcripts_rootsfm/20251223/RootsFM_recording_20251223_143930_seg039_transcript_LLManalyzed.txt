I know you want me, I can see it in your eyes But you keep on fucking with yourself on your mind Cause you prepare every time you need, you give me time, time When I ask you what's the deal, you hold it all inside If you wanna be with me, you gotta keep it real Tell me what's going on, tell me how you feel But I know you want it just as much as I want you To come and get my love, I'm here for you
