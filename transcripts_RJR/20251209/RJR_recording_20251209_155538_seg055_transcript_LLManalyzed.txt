============================================================

somebody who is self-taught and wants to start a creative business such as yours? I would say consistency is very important because I realized that that's kind of what has allowed me to reach so far that I I've been very consistent and kind of treating this like like more than a hobby and like actually putting the time and effort into it, even outside of if it's going to make me immediate money, the consistency I think is very important when you're doing something like this. And also I would say the willingness to maybe try something before you have all your ducks in a row. To just start and see where it leads you and if you fail that's okay but I think in my journey personally that's kind of what I've had to do is just do the thing and then you learn while you're doing it.
