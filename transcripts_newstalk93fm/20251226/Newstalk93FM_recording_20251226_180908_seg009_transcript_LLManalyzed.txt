Look where we reach, you know. Why we bringing son up to the beach, you know. Just see the relationship breathe. He's not your man. He is not my girl, until we re-show So you could jump up and do your work and never wanna fall over like it And it's your filter while on everybody inside it Like yourself, like yourself, like yourself You know I love to fight So don't come and try to interrupt me fight Even if I were in the room with that next man You will have to get no shit
