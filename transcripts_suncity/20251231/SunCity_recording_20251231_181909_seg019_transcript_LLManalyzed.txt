You know I've seen a lot of what the world can do And it's breaking my heart in two Because I never want to see you sad Don't be a bad girl But if you want to leave, take good care Hope you find a lot of nice things out there But just remember there's a lot of bad girls Oh baby, baby, it's a wild world. It's hard to get by just to promise my world. And a blessed New Year greetings to her mother, Marcia. Sorry, not Marcia.
