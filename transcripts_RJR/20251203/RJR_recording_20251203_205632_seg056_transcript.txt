All right, indeed a doctor being a man taking us up to the break indeed. We got more on the flip side. Hi, I'm Stephen Price, VP and General Manager of Flow. Jamaica stands tall. No matter the challenge, we rise together with resilience that keeps our island moving forward. And Flow stands right beside you. We are restoring the hardest-hit communities, strengthening every connection, and introducing new technology like satellite-powered solutions, voice over Wi-Fi, to help keep you connected wherever you are. We are building a network ready for progress, ready for stronger relationships, ready to take Jamaica forward. This is your network. Flow. This is Jamaica's network.
