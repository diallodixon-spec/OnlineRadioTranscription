Just like a boxer Catch a girl in a ring just like a lobster And have her clean just like a mafia We a big, big crew When you see we put the bar on her foot We not take liquor and write name in her We are on the ground What house? Badness? Where dem a sit? How we have up the ass? Etc, where dem a sit? Chain it a jib, a clasp for her foot
