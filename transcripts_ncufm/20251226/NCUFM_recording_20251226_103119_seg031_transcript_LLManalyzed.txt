20251226 103119 Love me too Love me too I could always, I could always I could always spend one year every day Oh yeah, but I just didn't win You were always right, always right When I read the words I find that you will be mine I was busy minding my own business Slippery trying to stay on top of my game Never thinking about consequences Always finding me somebody to blame
