20251226 172312 What propelled you to join the Bobsled team? Honestly, I didn't even know about bobsledding. I just got a message from a coach one day after the track and field season was over. I just get a message from him that the Jamaica Bobsled team wanted me to try out because they think that I could bring great help to the team. I have a great body structure that a Bobsleigh needs. So I just went and tried it and it's working now. I mean created history my first season in a couple months well so yeah. Nimroy talk to me about your part of the two-man team that won the bronze medal last month.
