20251219 185840 Liverpool. I think that Liverpool will indeed win this, and perhaps make a little bit of a climb up the table, which I see. All right, then now let's see if we see any other more in the watchable picture. All right, Arsenal must be watched, because they can't afford to slip any points here. Everton will be at home. Can they keep a clean sheet? Not likely. In my view, Arsenal, I think, will be at the top of the table at the end of this round. As I said at the start of the show here, that the three teams on top will be there at the end of the round, because it's a five-point margin between third and fourth. Now, match day number 18, perhaps a minute ago here, we can take a quick look and see if anything exciting is likely to come up. Liverpool, they will be certain of another three points because they go to Wolves. That's next.
