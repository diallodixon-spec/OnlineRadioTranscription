20251225 183718 You were my voice when I couldn't speak. You were my eyes when I couldn't see. You saw the best there was in me. Lifted me up when I couldn't reach. You gave me faith because you believed. I'm everything I am Because you loved me You gave me wings and made me fly You touched my head, I could touch the sky I lost my faith, you gave it back to me You said the star was out of reach You stood by me and asked the door I had your love, I had it all I'm grateful for each day
