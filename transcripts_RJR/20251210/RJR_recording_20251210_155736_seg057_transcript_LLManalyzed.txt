Ask in layman terms, like sometimes we're ashamed to ask, but ask. When they say this is the interest rate, so like what now? What does this mean? How much am I going to pay back? How long am I going to be paying this loan for? How much is it I'm paying per month? Oh, another thing is, what happens if something happens and I miss a payment? What happens to my loan? At what point, if I don't pay, would my loan go into default? What would that mean in regards to the monies I had paid previously. Those are some of the questions that need to be asked before you sign on. Somebody say good afternoon, Dalia. This program with Nicolene should be repeated next week, week after next, the week after that. It is very practical and logical.
