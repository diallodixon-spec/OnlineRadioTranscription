It's a myth, none do exist, must be some imitation A pose of them take empty, so please take chance But them pictures say thank us, I'm the inspiration From mountains, advance my lion, if you want, yeah, that's wrong It's no print, me name not like this, found no invitation International nature, got to my destination And from me, down from the stage Me make the people sing along, me sang them From shaka la we make the dance so opaque From shaka la, we make the people let my rock From shaka da, come out a packie party later Lift it from top and buy me a little dress
