20251216 110907 Your head is bowed and no one understands how you feel You're tired and you're broken but they think you're made of steel Picking up the pieces of what's left of your faith The truth is you've looked everywhere to fill that empty space. Trying to find hope in a needle. Trying to pull strength from a cigarette. Giving pieces of yourself to make, each with more regret. Don't give up alone, don't give up alone. God will never give up on you.
