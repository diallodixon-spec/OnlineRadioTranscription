Tots of smiles and laughter all about. Christmas come while Chrismas freeze a bow. And children dreaming of gifts without a doubt. Christmas seeping through jammed down Jamaican Santa with poinsettia all around We don't have mistletoe, we don't have no snow or ice But we have Jamaican Christmas and all the Christmas nice, nice Christmas breeze, Christmas breeze of I blow. Can you feel it? Christmas breeze, Christmas, please I blow. Oh, Christmas breeze, Christmas please I blow.
