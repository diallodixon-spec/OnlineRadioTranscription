20251222 214929 I'm really feeling in the mood for love So tell me why I stop to think about this weather, my dear This little dream I laid away There I go talking out of my head again Oh baby won't you come and put our two hearts together That would make me strong and brave Oh when we are one I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid If there's a cloud up above us Go on and let it rain I'm sure our love together wouldn't do the hurricane Oh my baby, won't you please let me love you and get a release from this awful misery What is all this talk about loving me?
