20251223 144333 You're listening to Roots 96.1 FM. You think that this would bring me happiness. If at the end of every rainbow there was a treasure chest. Sometimes having more is really less. Take a look inside yourself, you'll realize you're really blessed. No matter how you saw it in blue. There's always someone who has it worse than you. Sometimes you gotta pay your dues. So don't worry, just push on through. Gotta dig up all my people who'll be working on the future though they know they gotta struggle. To all my homies working on the nine to five and doing right to keep themselves up out of trouble. Although sometimes I know it seems impossible.
