Oh, oh, oh, no, no, let it go Oh, oh, oooh, oooh, no, no Let it go Oh, oooh, oh, ooooh, no, no let And together we are complete, darling Keep me up Only you alone can put fire back in my soul Keep me up And they're telling me I should leave that fire alone Well, the more they tell me, the more I roll in your clothes I could never let you go Miss Oceanine Girl I'm coming home and I'll see you again All day through the night I dreamin' Miss Oceanine When you turn the top make it smooth my darling When outside it's pouring rain
