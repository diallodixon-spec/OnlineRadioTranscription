20251224 101008 the road is now clear and it's good to go. Alright? Remember that. Now, Christmas. What you having for the Christmas dinner? What you doing? Yeah? A lot of people having family and friends over and all kinds of celebrations. Well, take it easy, yeah? Yesterday I told you, urged you to take it easy on the roads. We don't wanna lose no more, yeah? Like we're in the year without any more loss of lives on the road. And it's a message I've been preaching for years and will continue to preach. People like Dr. Lucian Jones of the National Road Safety Council have been at it for a long time and please let us keep it safe, happy, peaceful, yeah, for the Christmas on the roads, all right? No more lives to be lost on the roads. All right? So be careful.
