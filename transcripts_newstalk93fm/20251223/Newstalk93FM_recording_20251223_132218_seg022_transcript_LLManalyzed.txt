20251223 132218 You see me in the street and I was moving correct Been running around trying to do the home run Left that girl, she was no fun I tie one, smoke one Big Chief Skeppy and I answer to no one Counting my blessings, I'm feeling special Birds out of view, SK level Give them the shaku when I dance with the devil Young fella Kuti, the return of the rebel I told her I need some space Real busybody, never stay in one place And she knows I got more tricks under my sleeve That's why she never wants me to leave Just give me love for tonight, give me love for the night, yeah, I'll waste no time
