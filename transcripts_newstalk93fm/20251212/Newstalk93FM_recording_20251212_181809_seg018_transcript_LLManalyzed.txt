Act like you heard me. Only serve it up if you deserve me, yeah. Girl, my love is worth it. Press it up, y'all. Push the stars. Act like you hurt me. All this I've made up if you deserve me. Shake it up like an earthquake. Push it up. Y'all, push the stones. On the bang, bang, bang. Pushin' on my buttons with no hesitation. Gas me up. Give me motivation. Tell me why we can't pick a destination. Gas me up, give me motivation now. Motion on my buttons, do not hesitate. Gas me up. Give me motivation. Tell me where we come. Pick a destination. Right, that's it. Biggie girl, you're the baddest, to be honest. But this girl from the planet, and I just go on this world. That's me.
