20260101 194822 I won't be my own best friend. Meet myself and I, that's all I've got in the end. That's what I found out. And it ain't no need to hide. I think about that from now on. I'm gonna be my best friend. You're controlling me, say that you love me, but you don't. Your family told me one day I would see it on my own. Next thing I know know I'm dealing with the three kids in my home Love is so blind it feels right when it's wrong Now that it's over, stop calling me Come pick up your clothes You don't need to front like you're still with me. All your homies know. Even your very best friend tried to warn me on the low. Took me some time, but now I am strong because I realize I've got myself.
