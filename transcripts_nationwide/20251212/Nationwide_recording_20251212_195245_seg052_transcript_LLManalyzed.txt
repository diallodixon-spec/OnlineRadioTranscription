20251212 195245 view and the opinion that the government should have the autonomy to shut down a school that puts children at risk? Whether it be private or public, that's all I'm asking you. I'm asking you one simple question. I want a straightforward answer. Do you think the Ministry of Education, the government, should have the autonomy, the power, in law to shut down a private school that puts their students at risk? first we have to debate how the policies and laws are going to be in place and how they are going to put in place for that to happen. We can't jump to a sanction before discussing policies. What are you talking about jumping? How have you arrived at this?
