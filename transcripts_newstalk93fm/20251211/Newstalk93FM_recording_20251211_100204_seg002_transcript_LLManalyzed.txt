Lauren Freyer, NPR News London. As Republicans and Democrats gear up for the midterm elections next year, they're each losing ground with a key group, young voters. That's according to a newly released University of Chicago survey of more than 5,000 young Americans ages 18 to 42. NPR's Elena Moore reports these voters are feeling increasingly unhappy with politics as they struggle with the high cost of living. This latest poll finds that roughly six in 10 young Americans have unfavorable impressions of both parties. Kathy Cohen runs the Gen forward survey. She argues that the dissatisfaction young people feel is tied to their concerns about the economy. There is a real sense that these individuals and these parts of the administration are not delivering. The poll finds that nearly nine in 10 young people are concerned about the price of food and the cost of health care. Plus about a third think they're going to be worse off financially than their parents. Elena Moore and pure news in western Washington.
