20251224 213119 turn to me and be appalled, and place your hand on your mouth. And when I think of it, I am horrified, and shuddering seizes my flesh. Why do the wicked live, grow old, even grow mighty in power? With them their offspring are established before them, and their descendants before their eyes. Their houses are safe without fear, and the rod of God is not upon them. His bull breeds and does not fail. His cow calves and does not miscarry. They send out their little ones like the flock, and their children dance around. They sing to the tambourine and the lyre, and they rejoice to the sound of the long flute. They spend days in prosperity and in peace they go down to Sheol and they say to God turn away from us for we do not desire to know your ways who is Shaddai that we should serve him or what would we benefit when we please
