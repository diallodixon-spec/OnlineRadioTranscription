============================================================

I'm gonna miss you. Please don't stop me. Tell me a lie. Say I look familiar familiar Though I know you don't even know my name Tell me a lie, say you just got into town Even though I've seen you here before, just hanging around. Tell me a lie, say you're not a married man. You don't know I saw you slip off your wedding band. Ooh, tell me a lie.
