20251222 193719 representing Jamaica was a really great experience. Being in that environment with all the top surfers in the world and making heats and making strides and putting Jamaica on the map is always a good feeling. This year, honestly, wasn't my best performance yet. I've done way better in past years. But with every competition know we learn and we grow from it so yeah after that I moved on over to Florida for another big pro event and I got a quarter final finish there so that kind of boosted the confidence again because in the sport of surfing it's it's not like track and field where you know you train and you have a track that you run on and on the day of the race for sure it's gonna be the same track everybody has to run on you know it's a more level playing field where surfing you get 20 minutes
