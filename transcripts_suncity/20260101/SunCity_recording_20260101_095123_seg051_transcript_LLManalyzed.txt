20260101 095123 Cause love can pull you deeper to a spell It will spin your mind around like a carousel And telling you love makes things happen You'll never know where it's coming from You'll never know who you're gonna love When there's a true love that takes over you There's never a time This love will let you know Love appears at the worst And even though it takes over your mind your heart is not your own there's no way of controlling love that controls your life
