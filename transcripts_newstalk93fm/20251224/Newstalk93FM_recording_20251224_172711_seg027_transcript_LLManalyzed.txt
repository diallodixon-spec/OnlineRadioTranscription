20251224 172711 If you hurt me, I deserve it I've been acting foolishly Forgetting what you are You start loving me, I know this But even chaos serves a purpose It feels good to love somebody And somebody loves you back So don't give in till you change mind Cause I'll be here for a lifetime You don't have to pretend about it because it's Christmas with Nana. Guess it's bye to the good times. And I'll be gone by the sunrise. I'll be better on my own. Nobody should call my phone. This is my last heartbreak song. I'll be good all on my own.
