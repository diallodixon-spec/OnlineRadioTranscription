20251215 130509 Welcome to Jam Town, baby. Look at people in the streets Chippin' down a lane It's how we break with the chain Come and taste our freedom, sweetie When you want your ways Look how you have in the places Hot and groovy Look what music do to me It's happy in a jam again Feel like a movie When you throw it back on me I feel no stress again
