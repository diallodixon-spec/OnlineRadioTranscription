20251219 162012 the commitment we have to people and community, the care and their well-being. Excellent. It's Christmas season. Definitely. I know Barita is always doing something special. Are you doing anything special at this time? Well, most definitely. This season, persons are generally concerned about security and their future. Yes. And at Barita, we continue to encourage our clients to thoughtful financial planning and just to encourage everyone that comes out. So, I mentioned top of financial planning but then also giving back. Mm hmm. And because giving back is actually an important part of well being. Absolutely. And listen, give it with love. Store it above. Give it to that willing heart. You give, you're going to get it back. I'm telling you, it's a great time to reinforce financial planning. It's the season for it, not just for spending people. We're going into a new year. So how can people engage with Pareta this season? Well, we have our staff and team members ready at our locations Monday
