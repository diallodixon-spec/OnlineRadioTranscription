20251222 211412 It's over now, oh tonight Jesus, take the wheel Take it from my hands Cause I can't do this on my own I'm letting go Give me one more chance Save me from this throne I'm on Oh Jesus take the wheel Oh I'm letting go, give me one more chance. Stay me running through what I'm on. Running through what I am on.
