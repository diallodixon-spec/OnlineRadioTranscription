20251223 173721 Alright. So, during the holiday break, I try as best as I can to be intentional. So, you know, the holiday, we have this connotation about resting and I try my best to also get that rest because you know, the semester has been a lot and I try to spend time with family and enjoy myself but I also make sure not to disconnect myself from God because as much as you know we go about our days and we eat food every day I believe everybody eats food every day so the fact is just like we need our physical nourishment I also need my spiritual nourishment every day so I have to keep myself connected to God even during the holiday okay yes amen amen to that I love the sound of that that's a great answer all right so Gabrielle what do you do to balance having fun and completing your responsibilities like whatever school work
