20251230 180803 You know, I know there's nobody greater than the Lord. South Africa, I love you so much. Come on, lift this sound. Better than that, better than that. Better than that. Looked all around couldn't find nobody Went down into the deepest valley looked all around down there couldn't find nobody I went across the deep blue sea Couldn't find one to come back To your grace, your love, your mercy
