20251226 113124 I love the way that you bring a vibe With your hands them up in the sky Falling down and up in the time Wine in season again And we have the money to spend And we jamming down to the end Runnin' with me cannibal friend Yeah, yeah, yeah. Love me, candy ball friend. Until we meet up again. Mm, everything on site, you know. Mm, the bag gone packed, you know. She dreamin' to take a ride on me. Cause she comin' down to please. When she ram a chair, she push it back, call the bambam, hold it. And she say then something from me.
