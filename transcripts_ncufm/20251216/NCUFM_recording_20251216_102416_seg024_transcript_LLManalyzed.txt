20251216 102416 Totally and without reservation, Lord please come in I don't wanna live another day not walking in your will I don't wanna sing another song you think has praised you all day long I don't wanna be another girl walking bloodily in this cold world. When will we really learn to give our hearts to Him? Totally end with our preservation, not please come back. I don't want to live another day not walking in the wind And I don't wanna sing another song if it can break you all day long I don't wanna be another girl walking in the wind
