20251218 140912 Well, please don't ask me what's on my mind I'm a little mixed up, gonna feel fine When I'm with a girl that I love best My heart beats so it scares me to death When she touches my hand I got the chill I got Why do fools fall in love? Why do birds sing so gay? In love there's no way to play, to? Why do fools fall in love? Why do they fall in love? Love is a losing game And love can be a shame I know I'm a fool, you see Oh, that fool is me, darling
