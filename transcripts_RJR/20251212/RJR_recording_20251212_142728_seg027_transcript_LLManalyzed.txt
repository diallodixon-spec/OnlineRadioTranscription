2025-12-12 15:51:58 It's just before the light I talk and expose my thoughts When I don't know how I survive Maybe you know the weight of the burden I carry In every night on my mind The only people I can turn to Are the ones who do Life's fun, but better must come. This one is for all who give up and don't. I've been there before. Don't leave a fight to fight. We don't need a thousand books to write. I've been there before Everything I want But by the dark it's far down the night If I never feel forgotten, wouldn't that be so tall?
