20260102 091408 Hello, this is Heaven. May I help you? Yeah, I think I found a flaw in your manual. You mean the Bible? Yes. You know that section that says, so in everything, do unto others as you'd have them do unto you? Matthew chapter 7 verse 12? Sure. Now, when you say everything, does that mean everything, or are there exceptions? What is it about the word everything that you don't understand, sir? Well, I have this really obnoxious brother-in-law, and I would love to just take some chicken feathers and some hot chocolate syrup and... Sir? Oh, I'm sorry. Um, surely there's got to be an exception to that rule. Trust me, sir. How about a loophole? There's a very good reason why there's no exception in that section. I don't think whoever wrote that ever met my brother in law. Regardless, sir, that section is a part of God's standard for how we are to treat others. are you willing to obey God even when it's tough?
