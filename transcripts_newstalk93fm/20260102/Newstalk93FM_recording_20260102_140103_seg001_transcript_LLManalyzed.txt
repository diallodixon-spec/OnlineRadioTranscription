20260102 140103 I love the way that you bring a vibe With your hands them up in the sky Falling down and up in a time Wh meet up again. Ah! Mm, everything gone sat, you know. Mm, the bag gone packed, you know. She dreaming to take a ride on me Cause she comin' down to please. When she ram a chair, she push it back, call the bamba rollin'. And she's savin' some for me. I tell it to your eye, love whenever you bring a vine. With your hands them up in the sky, watch we drunk and havin' a time.
