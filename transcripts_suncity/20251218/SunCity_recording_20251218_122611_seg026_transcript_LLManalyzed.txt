20251218 122611 I can tell you lying, cause when you're replying You're lying again I called you on your cell phone, no answer Tell me why So I paged you on your two-way, still no response I took care of you, I loved you, and you played me Stop finding me, about where you've been, cause you're taking me off, taking me out. I can't break, cause we're never fighting. Just dance, dance, dance. When you're with me, just dance. And I can't take it. Cause we're never fighting, just dance, dance.
