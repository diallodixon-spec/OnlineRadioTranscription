20251231 090002 You're listening to sleek radio 93 FM I feel your frequency from miles away You come alive with one wine baby With you I want to dance the night away One jam turn a, baby So don't feel away You don't like the fast life You look on the bright side, girl I go take the blame I just want you come and light it up Just a little winding up Come and meet me behind the truck and we rev it up Whole day Keep throwing it back, I know why you stop
