2025-12-11 22:34:04 The way it used to be Back to being a child again Thinking the world was mine I wanna see Christmas Christmas through your eyes I see the rain You see the rainbow Hiding in the clouds Never afraid To let your love show Won't you show me how Wanna learn how to believe again Find the innocence in me again Through your young heart Help me find a way
