20251215 105434 I should have gotten used to this pain already. I can't tell you. It's because the Lord has blessed me. I'm a mother of three and a grandmother of six. As soon as I start feeling the pain, it comes in a way where, listen, I'll call my son or somebody and I'll say, listen, you need to get me to the hospital right away. Because the medicine that I'm on now, it's not working. It's not working. So I need something straight.
