20260101 160807 In Japan, we were touring Irving and Kirk. And we were opening the show, and then they wanted to close the show, and they wanted to re-close it. No, no, no, no. We opened it, man, because... Well, they wanted to not open it, you know. So we went out there and kicked it in, you know. And I told them I couldn't believe what I knew. So, it was like a joy. They were playing on the stage, and making music, and I dancing and you know, you have all the things. Listen, Walton, Walton, although this was from earlier, but I just saw it when he said, Delia, keep sly talking for at least half hour more. Then he had one more hour, if possible.
