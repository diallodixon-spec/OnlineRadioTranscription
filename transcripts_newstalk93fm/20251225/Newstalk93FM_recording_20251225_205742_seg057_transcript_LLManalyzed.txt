20251225 205742 You ain't gotta go nowhere, you can stay inside it Can you blow my mind? Set off my whole body If I give you my time Can you stretch my soul from me? I don't wanna wait Don't take it Take me where I ain't been before Can you blow my mind? off my whole body, whole body Made me sweat, made me hotter Made me lose my breath, made me water Made me sweat
