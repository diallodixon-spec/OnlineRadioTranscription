Alright it's funny you ask that because I was while driving here I was talking to a friend he's overseas and you know um he was saying that he has his you know he sees no theme thing already. Already for Christmas? Already man yeah some people that thing I freeze I set one aside long time you know but how I would elevate a whole roasted chicken like we focus on the chicken yes first and foremost brining now brining is just making sure that you put the chicken or some salt water that's it that well wet brining that is you can dry brine which is just as me say salt just put salt over the chicken right put it in the fridge don't cover it up no after you're done brine okay how long do you brine for? So a whole chicken give him 24 hours oh my god yeah man give him 24 but remember say no just put it in the brine and leave it in okay okay after you come out of the brine now you pat dry with it
