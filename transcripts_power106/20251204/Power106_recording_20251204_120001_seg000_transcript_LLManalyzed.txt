============================================================

You're not calling the radio stations and whatnot and complaining about this, that and the other. So I recognize that fact from them. And I challenge all owners to say not go so. All right, news is next. When we come back at around about 12.35, I'll be talking to Jerry Johnson of International Banking fame to get some qualifications and information on the loans afforded to Jamaica. You're listening to Power 106 FM. The time is now 12 o'clock. News comprehensive, powerful, powerful and credible. Power 106 FM now presents a simulcast of Radio Jamaica's News at Noon. Thank you very much.
