**Interview with Bishop Joshua on Devotion of the Stars**

In a recent broadcast on Sun City Radio, Mama Bee hosted Bishop Joshua on the "Devotion of the Stars" segment. Bishop Joshua shared his favorite biblical scripture, Ecclesiastes 12:12, which reads, "Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter: Fear God and keep His commandments, for this is the whole duty of man." He emphasized the importance of fearing God and following His commandments, stating that this is the meaning of life. Bishop Joshua also discussed the problem of people no longer striving for perfection and the need to cooperate with a mindset of reaching the kingdom of God.

Bishop Joshua criticized some churches for teaching lies and deceit, stating that "there's so many churches out here teaching that you are already saved... some knowingly and granted some unknowingly, only passing on the lie which they have inherited from their fathers from generation to generation." He encouraged listeners to choose life and come back to the Most High God in spirit and truth, not just with their mouths, but also in action and doing. He emphasized that faith without works is dead.

**Interview with President-elect Cheryl Wilson of the Kiwanis Club of Western St. Andrew**

Mama Bee also interviewed President-elect Cheryl Wilson of the Kiwanis Club of Western St. Andrew on the "Hello Jamaica" show. The Kiwanis Club is hosting a health and wellness Christmas fair in collaboration with the Indian High Commission. Wilson explained that the fair is inspired by the club's dedication to helping children and that they have been supporting the Laura Basic School for over 40 years.

The fair will offer free medical and wellness services, including deworming, blood tests, urine screening, dental checkups, and general physician checkups. Wilson emphasized the importance of health and wellness, stating that "without health, there's nothing else." She also highlighted the club's partnership with the Indian High Commission and the early childhood commission to provide testing and evaluation for the children.

Wilson encouraged families to prioritize health and wellness during the holiday season, stating that "health is our greatest wealth and it is the foundation for the future." She invited listeners to attend the fair and get involved with the Kiwanis Club, which is celebrating 110 years of service. The club can be found online on Facebook, and listeners can keep up with their activities and events throughout the year.
