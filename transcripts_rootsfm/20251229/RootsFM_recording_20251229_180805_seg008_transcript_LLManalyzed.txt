20251229 180805 When the world's driving me crazy Earth is shaking at my feet Feel a weight upon my shoulder You're my rescue. You're my remedy. Everything about you frees me. I relax and take it easy. Cause you give me hope, hope. You're like the morning sun and I'm not alone. You give me hope, hope. You're like the sunrise. No, I'm not afraid, because you give me hope.
