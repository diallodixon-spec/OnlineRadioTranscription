As an ambassador, salute in the Christian soldiers. Salute, Christian soldiers. Standing on the front line with Jehovah. Representing the King as an ambassador. Salute in the Christian soldiers! Let me see you put your hand in the air. If you're a Christian soldier, well, have no fear. Something is going on. Our season is here, restoring everything, damage no more, disrepair. We declare. We declare. Soldiers, attention. We're the Christian soldiers. We're the future we're about.
