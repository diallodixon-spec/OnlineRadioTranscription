20260101 210705 when you're here with me and love you when you're gone. Situations so wrong, but babe your love is so strong. Enough to love you when your here with me, and love you when your gone. To another girl's heart. I deserve better, but baby better make me stay by you. Give me pleasure, so I'll keep saying that's the way love you when you're here with me, and love you when your gone. Situations so wrong, but babe the love is so strong. And I'll still love you when your here with me, And love you when youre gone, To another girl's heart.
