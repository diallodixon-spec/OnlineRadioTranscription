============================================================

One, two, three, five. Make me fall in love with the me. If ever I believe my world is gone, then I'll start back at home. Do you ever think about me? Do you ever cry yourself to sleep In the middle of the night when you're away Are you calling out for me Do you ever reminisce I can't believe I'm acting like this Now it's crazy How I still can feel your kiss It's been 6 months, 8 days, 12 hours since you went away I miss you so much and I don't know what to say I should be over you, shouldn't know better But it's just not that case
