2025-12-12 15:56:29 I want to add, I went to Westmoreland to do an outreach. And can I tell you, these people don't have no houses, they don't have no water. They don't have no light, but they still have a smile. And they're grateful. They're so grateful. And they're willing to give you, and they don't have. And I always say, Jamaican people are very resilient. We bounce back from anything. We always look at the brighter side of our situation. That whole idea of resilience is what carried you through when you said your dad transitioned. 100%. I had to just understand that life is about balance. It's ups and downs, and you just have to go through the rough patches. It's how you, it's basically what you do with that rough patch that gives you the end result. Absolutely, well said. The piece I wrote today, I dedicated it to Aluna Samba. Oh, he lost her son. Today's his birthday. Oh, today? It just so happened that I published it today.
