20251223 202722 You ever hear about something called HbA1c? I do blood tests, but my son tastes my sugar for me sometimes. I mean he tasted it on the last time, so it's 8 points something. Right. But I was to do all of those tests, A1c or whatever, but the machine not working, so I never get to do it. You never got to take you to another place where the machine is working and find out what the HbA1c is. It's a very important thing you see. I'm just going to give you a figure. As a diabetic for 38 years you want the Hb A1c to be 7 or less.
