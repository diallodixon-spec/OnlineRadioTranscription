20251212 133421 to me, but I do hear that you can go to KPH, as that is the closest zone to us right now, and it takes about 20 minutes, and you get your card. And as we said before, once you get to 60 years old, it automatically rolls over to JEDEP. Thank you so much, NHF, for all the work that you do for us here. And I see they have pamphlets here on breast cancer, prostate cancer, asthma, lung cancer. To ensure that you stop by the booth, register for your card, whether it's NHF or JADEP, and get to know your numbers and your status. That's my check-in for right now. We're gonna be checking in with you later on, but today this is Roots 96.1 FM. We are here until 4 p.m. We'll be right back.
