20251217 131108 I love you more and more Cause you are the most special one You're the only one now I'm the only one My eyes adored you Though I never laid a hand on you, my eyes adored you Like a million miles away from me, you couldn't see how I adored you so close so close and yet so far carried your books from school play and make believe you're married to me
