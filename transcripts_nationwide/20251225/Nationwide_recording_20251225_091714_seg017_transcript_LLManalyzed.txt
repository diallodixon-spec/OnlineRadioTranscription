20251225 091714 We understand In the rain the snow is glistening A beautiful song for happy tonight Walking in a wonderland Gone away is the blue bird Here to stay is the new bird He sings a love song As we go along Walking in a world of wonderland In the meadow we can build a snowman And pretend that he is crossing ground He'll say I don't mind, we'll settle down there But you can do the job when you're alone Let alone smile As we dream on fire To face all the pain and all the plans that we made Walking in a winter wonderland
