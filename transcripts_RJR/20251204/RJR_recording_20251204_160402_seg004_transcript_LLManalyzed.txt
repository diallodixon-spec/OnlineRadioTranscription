After the hurricane, children may experience emotional distress caused by fear, exhaustion or hunger. Stay calm, listen and help them understand what they're feeling. Try to meet their basic needs. Give them food, water, rest and reassurance. Help them relax with simple breathing exercises or by reading their favorite story. Time, attention and a warm hug are your best tools. Let your child know that their reactions are normal and that many other children feel the same way.
