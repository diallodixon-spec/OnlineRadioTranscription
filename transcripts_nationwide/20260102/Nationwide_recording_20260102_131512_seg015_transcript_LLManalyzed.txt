20260102 131512 From Waterhouse to Jerusalem From Painland to Delakre All you can do if you have a plan And have some ambition And make sure who knows for me, Nadia Magidian So when you shouldn't become a man Him know just where you stand Him know him poop was set in So him follow tradition If Marcus Calvis, if he read Then we're so manna free Cause knowledge are the key And it will set the people free And highly I feel as if it Is African unity Who know what's just segregation And social impurity The race is not just for the swift For those who can endure Make sure you have a steady footing in as I am done And keep your thoughts set pure Shall love be small or poor For some little boy or boy Moomah can't afford If just her blood will run The nature will be done, the heaven and the earth will pass
