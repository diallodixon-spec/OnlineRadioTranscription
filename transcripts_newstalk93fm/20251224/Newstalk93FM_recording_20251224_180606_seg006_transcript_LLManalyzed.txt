20251224 180606 So relaxing. When I'm feeling under the weather You just make me feel sweet Ice the cocoa tea, use the sugar And together we are complete, darling Heat me up Only you alone can put fire back in my soul Heat me me up. And they tellin' me I should leave that fire alone. Well, the more they tell me, the more I hold in your clothes. I could never let you go. Miss Oceania.
