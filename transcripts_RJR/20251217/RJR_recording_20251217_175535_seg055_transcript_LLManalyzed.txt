20251217 175535 is the first time that they will encounter the justice system. I have had parents cry and lament to me about their children being so withdrawn, not even wanting to talk to girls. As a 14 year old, you're in a class because remember, they're still expected to attend school, engaging activities and be children. And they of somebody that I represented they were so scared to even look on a girl and it was an older girl that had wooed him and encouraged him to participate in that activity but the law does not take that into consideration.. Do you think of Shirley's point though that we need to send a message and keeping it as a criminal offence is an effective way of sending that message? Children will continue to have sex, they have been having sex,
