Well, I don't like birds in the trees. I'd be in a world of trouble, girl, if you wasn't here with me. Stay forever mine. Oh, cause, cause you're my kind. Ooh, baby, baby, baby girl, you know that I like what you like, you like what I like. Girl, we belong together. Oh, baby, oh, baby, you. I got what you want. You got what I want. And we were made for each other, for each other, girl. You and me, girl.
