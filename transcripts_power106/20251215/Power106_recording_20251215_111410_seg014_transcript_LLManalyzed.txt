20251215 111410 I don't know where... Where did this Black River conversation start from? It started with the Prime Minister went to Black River first and said it was ground zero. So it started with him and the media just followed PP clocked up. It's not even the place that has been hardest hit. Yep, precisely. He described it as ground zero. Well, I guess because it's the first thing he saw. The government has committed 600 million Jamaican dollars to help displace tourism workers, repair and rebuild homes damaged by Hurricane Melissa as part of a broader public-private recovery program now expected to exceed Jamaican two billion. You are a good initiative because the industry is like to be on pause for a year. Many of the hotels say May next year, some September we see the Hyatt Group saying not until November next year. Wow. So these people are going to really need assistance.
