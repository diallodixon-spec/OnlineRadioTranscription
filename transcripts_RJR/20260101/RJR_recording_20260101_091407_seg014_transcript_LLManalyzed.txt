20260101 091407 In the middle of the road, the symphony just a roll, of people like fleas on the borders. Somewhere I lost my girl, in the storm in the world, but I feel no pain, I'm coop around her hand. Jumping with the band, me bottle in me hand, like living with lightning and thunder. I'll be jumping, jumping here on Ring Road Everybody jump in Cannibal on Ring Road The party comes in hot, hot, hot here on Ring Road I'm going to have a bar jam in Ring Road Let me hear it for the UAE party Let me hear it from the New York party Let me hear from the Trini party
