20251224 121209 and news you can trust. West Indies Test Captain Rosson Chase has admitted that he has let the team down with his performances during the just-concluded three-test series against New Zealand, where the team lost 2-0. The Barbadian is yet to taste a victory as West Indies test captain since his appointment in June following a two-year absence from the test arena. The 33-year-old scored just 42 runs across six innings in the series at an average of just seven, the second lowest output in test history for a captain dismissed six times in a series. With the ball, the off-spinner took only three wickets at an average of 129. It was the latest in a string of poor runs since coming back to the game's longest format, as the window skipper has scored just 221 runs in his 16 innings at an average of 13.
