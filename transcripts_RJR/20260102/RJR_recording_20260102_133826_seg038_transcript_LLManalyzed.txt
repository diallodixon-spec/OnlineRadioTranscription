20260102 133826 I swear it's true All the people, me and you No more timing Each tear that falls from my eyes I'm not hiding The remedy to cure this old heart of mine I can dream about you If I can't hold you tonight I can dream about you, if I can't hold you tonight. I can't dream about you, you don't have to hold me just right.
