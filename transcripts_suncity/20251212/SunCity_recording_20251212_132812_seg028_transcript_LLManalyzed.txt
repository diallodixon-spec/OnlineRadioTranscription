20251212 132812 I don't need to warn in a long time Let's go. I don't give a shit that I run a boom boom So now I'm the hater, you look blind but I pray to the savior Beli I'm now at your neighbor, it's like boy I got me traffic through the Haker and the drummer yelling I have a hair pack Pull up the hair pack, stop move like a depod in my waist man, raccoon in a jeep
