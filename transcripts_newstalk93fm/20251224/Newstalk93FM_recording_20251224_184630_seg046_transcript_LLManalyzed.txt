20251224 184630 I won't ask for much this Christmas. I won't even wish for snow. I'm just going to keep on waiting. Oh, I need the mistletoe. I'm going to make a list and send it to the North Pole for singing. I won't even stay awake to hear the magic rain declare. Cause I just want you here tonight, holding on to me so tight. What more can I do? Oh, baby, all I want for Christmas is you, you, you, baby. Oh, oh, oh, the lights are shining so brightly every night. And I saw the children laughing.
