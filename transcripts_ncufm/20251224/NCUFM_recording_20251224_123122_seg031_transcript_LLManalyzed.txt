20251224 123122 It's a boost to our day that coffee never will. It's even been said, most times the person you find it hardest to love is the one that needs it the most. Think about that the next time someone annoys you. Maybe God made a kindness appointment for you. Maybe you've heard, the best gift you can give is a hug. One size fits all and nobody ever minds if you return it. It can be a hard gift to give, but it does get easier and the personal blessings are worth the moment of discomfort. God was the creator of kindness. Kindness is what helps turn people toward him. Kindness is one of the best ways to show love. Kindness I have to be very honest with you right now.
