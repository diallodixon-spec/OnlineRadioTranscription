============================================================

I'll adore you, I treat you like milk, I'll do nothing to spoil you I know your friends wanna holla cause I got them dollars pushed to pay back Monday, Tuesday, Impala I switch whips like kicks, I'm a baller And if I get your phone number, I'ma call you And we can meet up the next day and chill But I'm always on the road, baby girl that's how I live I got bills to pay, I got moves to make But when my plane touch You can call me your baby girl
