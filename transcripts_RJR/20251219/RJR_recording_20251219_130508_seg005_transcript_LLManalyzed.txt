20251219 130508 I'm tired of giving my love and getting nowhere, nowhere. What I need is somebody who really cares. I really need a lover, a lover that wants to be there. It's been so long since I've touched a holding hand. I can't put my love on the line that I hope you understand. So baby, if you want me, you've got to show me love. Words aren't so easy to say, oh, you've got show me love.
