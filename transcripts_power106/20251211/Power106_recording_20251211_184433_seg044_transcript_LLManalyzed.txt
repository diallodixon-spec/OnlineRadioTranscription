It's a different thing, it's more you wear heels, you're not, you know, it's bodybuilding, you know, you just go up there, do your routine and pose, and this is just a regular thing. So when they asked me to do bodybuilding also, I'm like, I didn't train for this, I didn't work my upper body, how am I going to do this? And I decided to make a routine, actually on stage, but because of the experience of bodybuilding all these years, I made up my routine right up there, get there get a song and I said okay this is what you're going to do and um I'm really I did very well in the bodybuilding I it was really bodybuilding, physique at first place um it was just everything was just surreal I get like what is that being here I never even realized I went on stage 11 times get the medals, I'm like 11 times I went on stage. They were all just amazing. What an experience. Talk about Lenita Riley and Jojo Riley. Now talk quickly about those persons.
