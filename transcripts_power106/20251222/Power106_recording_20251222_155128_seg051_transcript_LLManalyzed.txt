20251222 155128 That's epic. Epic, epic, epic, epic. I can't. Epic indeed, yeah. But Jesse, I don't know how she's going to talk about it today. By the way, that lady just spoke about flow. Oh my God. This pattern. Flow is a disaster in Jamaica. I don't know what they're doing. First of all, one thing that I've realized that they're doing infrastructurally, they're running their wires so low. All the cable companies, so short-lost, take them down one, two, three. Why they do that? At least in my town, in Moby, they run the wire so low. People have to push the wire up and they have to chuck them in their yard. But why, Jesse? Why? I don't know. I think they have run lines for decades.
