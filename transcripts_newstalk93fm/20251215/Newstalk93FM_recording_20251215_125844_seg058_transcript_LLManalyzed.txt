20251215 125844 it's been crazy lately i've been in my fields got me rearranging all of my plans, all my dreams It'll be invigorating Anytime you'll be around Same time, it'll be frustrating When I see you in a crowd My eyes, they go wherever Girl, all I do is stare And when you notice I know you would be so extra I swear I'm supposed to feel when you're that close I mean that's can't reveal for me emotions I mean that's one for seeing through the most of you
