20251212 210302 I'm like a puzzle with a figure and a hard nut for crack. A nerve digger straight from jam rock Some call me Dirty Nigga through my camera dreadlocks A smile on my face, a wharf to stab me on my back And when I bow down, no, you must imagine we could do two deaths, obligation from birth Although the running slow, ragga ragga gonna hit up We know know where life worked. Well, I say, yellow Prostate for right now, McFlicks. Yes. And they make me go through the choices. No man can decide my destiny. Only I can decide my own for me. Why? Because I'm a whole dandelion.
