They have beds where you lay down there and get relaxed when they give you the medication. All right, for me, the morphine works very fast. So when I get the morphine, I am tranquilized. So I would need a bed to lay down on to relax, to get the body, let the body relax so that it can be healed within maybe half an hour of you getting the medication to an hour. It all depends how your body reacts to the medication. So you have to be prostrate, have to be lying down as against it. It is best when you are relaxed.
