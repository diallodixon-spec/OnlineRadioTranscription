20251215 204933 Me sweetheart, you're everything I never hoped to own A smile from you lights up my heart And brightens all my days I just love you, I love you, I'll love you, I love you. I love you so many, many ways. If words could say how much I care, my dear, you'd be amazed. I will love, I love you. I love you. Oh, so many, many ways. Your lips are mine.
