Sweet Jamaica, we love you Hurricane has been gone But we're still standing strong Hurricane Melissa, come and test me Crush off where your body can break free She blows off water on me But God's still watching over us Melissa entered from the south to the north coast with some serious hurricane wind. Now she made us stronger the call. Feel like Jamaica. Sweet, sweet Jamaica. We only feel like home. Feel like sweet Jamaica. Yes, it is. Let love be the key. Together we'll strong one family. Feel like Jamaica, sweet, sweet Jamaica.
