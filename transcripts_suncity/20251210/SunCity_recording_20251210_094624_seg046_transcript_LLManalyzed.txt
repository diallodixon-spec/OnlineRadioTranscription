And guess what? Germans can go anywhere in Europe without a visa and do whatever they want to do for, what, 60 days a year? Six, what is it, six months a year? So they rather, but this was African descent, people need to realize here. They rather take a nation that wanted to annihilate all of Europe in their country, visa-free, live, do what they want to do, than people that died for Europe, which is Africans. So I'm trying to figure out in Africa when all these smart leaders sit down and think, do they think Europe really have their best interests aside? Do they think Europe see us as their equal? And I'm saying this is supposed to be a wake up call to understand. And you know, to be honest, I'm a little bit embarrassed as to the nonchalant way of approaching the reality here or to fix this. I don't know what it is, but I'm embarrassed.
