20251215 164334 Take me deeper, deeper, deeper Deeper love than you Say I'm living just for me That God can save anybody If you only trusted Him He will save you from your sin and take you far within If you can walk upon the water And raise a man little daughter If you can mend a broken heart You can give me a brand new start There's nothing you can't order
