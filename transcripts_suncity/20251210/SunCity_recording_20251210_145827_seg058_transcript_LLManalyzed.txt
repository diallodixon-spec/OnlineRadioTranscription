Yeah, we got the beat from start, no matter how them talk. And I tell myself we just not gonna last. Girl, call my beat, your beat. When we get together, why beat number one on the chart? Girl, if you listen when me talk, you're the light in all me dark. Keep on writing. And if you go walking down the path, y'all are you, I keep the spark It's the name. Keep vibing. Girl, you make a fire ignite into my brain every night. You and me colliding. Girl, you know why you are with me. What? Off the top, me off the top. I got nothing hiding. Could it be because you're good to me that it feels like magic while I wouldn't have it any other way no i wouldn't have any other way i get butterflies every time we touch wouldn't it be tragic if we couldn't feel this every day
