20251229 173320 Thank you so much for staying with us. We continue with you on Beyond the Headlines. I'm Dionne Jacks-Millaw. We're talking to Senior Superintendent of Police Dennis Brooks, Senior Communications Strategist at the Jamaica Constabulary Force, talking to us about a significant reduction in major crimes, especially murder in 2025. And just before the break, you had said that the aim is to go, you said not just sub-1,000 murders for the year, but sub-800, which you were about to say would take us into a different category, a significantly different category. Let me ask you to follow up on that. Indeed. Thank you very much. So, yes. So, I mean, considerable research has been done in the past among persons who most of the country respects where the study of violence is concerned. And everyone has said we need to get below 800 again. We need to take us back into the sub-800.
