20251231 152814 Right. Just get prayed up. Keep your prayers up. Always pray to God and holy faith. All the trials and tribulations, all the obstacles you faced in 2025. It's going to go away in 2026. Give thanks for life. Always remember that. You got life. No matter how bad things are, remember you have somebody on a bed in our hospital right now. They would be, they would happy to be in poverty right now, walking and with a healthy, healthy, healthy body. All right? No matter how bad your situation is, always remember, there's somebody out there who wish they were in your situation, all right? All right, so next time for the break, when we come back, more music on the flip side. My name is Sun Jack, Ali Patch.
