20251224 165532 in this place night and day, without nine drummers drumming, while the eight flaming maids of Milken is beating me poor old alcoholic mother out of her own kitchen and gobbling everything in sight. I'm warning you, you're making an enemy of me. Gov'net, day ten. Listen, manure face, I hope you will be haunted by the strains of the tin pipers piping which was sent to Tormentus last night. They were aided in their evil work by those maniac drummers, and it't a pleasant sight to look out the window and see eight hefty maids and milking, pogoing round with the ensuing punk rock uproar. My mother has just finished her third bottle of whisky on top of 124 grains of Valium. You'll get yours, mother, your Dr. Jezebel. It was bad enough to have eight maids of milk and dancing to punk music on the front lawn. But they've now been joined by your friends, the eleven lords a leaping. And the antics of the whole lot of them would leave the most decadent days of the Roman Empire looking like outlook. I'll get you yet, you old bag.
