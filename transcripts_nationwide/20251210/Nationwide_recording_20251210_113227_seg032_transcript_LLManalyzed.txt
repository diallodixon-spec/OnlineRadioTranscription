love the NBA and the heart. My fingers on this right hand burned me like pepper for about half an hour afterwards. I've never experienced anything like that. One time I think sitting around with my hand. I said, no man, it was so cold. Yeah. And you have Jamaicans who face this every single day. So whatever, some of the sin, Western Union are sinning on a barrel for you, be grateful and be thankful. Do not harass them. If I only want one shoes, if I only want one jeans. Yeah, many of you't even a house in anywhere near the kind of weather that these people have to plow through literally to get to the work so they can pay the bills sustain themselves and break off a little thing and send you so be grateful
