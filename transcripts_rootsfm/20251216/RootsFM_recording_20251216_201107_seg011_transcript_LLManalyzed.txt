20251216 201107 I thought you romancing in another man arms It hurt me so much, my whole life fell apart How could this be? You're cheating on me At first I was sad, but now I am glad You couldn't be the girl for me, na-na-na Couldn't be a girl for me You couldn't be a girl from me, na na na Couldn't be the girl from me Love make you blind as a bat, now I can see I thought you were special Only good for me You've been telling me lies With some foolish alibis Now I recognize The unfaithfulness in your eyes
