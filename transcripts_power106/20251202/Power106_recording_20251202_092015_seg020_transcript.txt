The Sweden Risk Bank held its rate at 2.25% per annum on March 20, and the Swedish National Bank cut its rate to 0.25% on the same day. Global central banks are now holding interest rates firm or cutting them cautiously in order to contain inflation without causing a recession as well as to prevent a run on their currencies in favor of the US dollar. Many investors, analysts and traders believe inflation was peaking as a result. The Fed should have paused before it did but Professor Summers originally disagreed. of the Fed's original inflation forecast was ridiculous, and further that the peak theory was just as delusional as the transitory theory. He also argued that the current problem related to inflation is similar to the one faced by the late former chairman of the Fed, Paul A. Volcker, who jacked up the benchmark rate to as high as 20% per annum, and the unemployment rate to 10% during the 1980s.
