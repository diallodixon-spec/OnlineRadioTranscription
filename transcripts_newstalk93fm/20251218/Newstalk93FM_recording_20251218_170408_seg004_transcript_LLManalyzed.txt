20251218 170408 So pray for me If I don't come home in the morning Just know that I say it's not in my place But this mass have a hold on me Oh To send a search party to find me, I out on the road and lie me Tell them that it's ok to have me, I won't see me Wednesday To send a search for me to find me I lost on the road and rise me Tell them that is ok I have me, I will see me Wednesday I'm not coming home tonight
