20251230 190003 As simple as this issue might sound, the fact of the matter is every single practitioner within the racing industry has their own concern, has their own issue. And a great thing as a commission, gone are the days where, you know, we're sitting in an office, you know, handing out decisions without hearing from the people. The fact of the matter is we intend to listen to the people. They may not agree with us all the time, but let it not be said that we are not listening to them. And as such, that will be the mandate of this commission. And we hope and anticipate that, you know, whatever future commission would have looked at what they would have done and said, you know, this is a good platform for us to continue. Mr. Brian Ray, chairman of First Rock Group of Companies and recently appointed chair to chair the Betting Gaming and Launches Commission, the Casino Gaming Commission and the Jamaica Racing Commission. Thank you very much, sir, for taking the time to give us some breaking news here on our show.
