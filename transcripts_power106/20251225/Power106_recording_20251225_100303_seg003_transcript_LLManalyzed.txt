20251225 100303 I don't want no blood to run through this Christmas It's a real alone through red in the streets Me the baby shatter dem fi run me the wishy ah Fireworks are love fi a beat Me don't want blood to run this Christmas Better you spend some time with your family Knife and gun fi put down fi the Christmas And make me live the new year in peace When I want no blood to run for the Christmas It's a real lonesome wedding of the streets With a bit of shelter, them three grandmids are wishing out A firework's a lonesome beat When I want to blood to run, it's a Christmas
