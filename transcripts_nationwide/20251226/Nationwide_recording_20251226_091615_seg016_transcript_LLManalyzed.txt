20251226 091615 For the rest of all those loves Endless sleep, all I know Tried to shake your mind But that can't happen to me I'm not the jealous kind No one can change what I feel and nothing can take me Still I'll ride with you every night And I'll sign my name, love, always And even if the sun falls down I will always be around Forever and always And darling if we both can breathe
