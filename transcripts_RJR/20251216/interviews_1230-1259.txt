The minister highlighted the widespread damage to homes, roads, and communities, particularly in areas such as Folly, Parathy, and Galleon, where entire communities were destroyed. He also mentioned that the storm surge had destroyed homes, cut roads in half, and taken out boats, leaving many people without access to basic necessities.

Despite the challenges, Green emphasized the resilience of the Jamaican people, saying that "once there's life, there's hope."

He reported that 70% of the scotch bonnet pepper crop and 100% of commercial banana production were lost. Additionally, 40% of egg-producing chickens and 700,000 broilers were lost.

Green highlighted the efforts of his ministry to support farmers and fishers, including the distribution of seedlings, fertilizer, and solar-powered storage units. He also mentioned that over 3,000 boats were damaged or destroyed, and that his ministry was working to provide support to fishers to get back out to sea.

The minister expressed his gratitude to the people of St. Elizabeth for their resilience and determination, saying that "we are a people that will never stop trying." He emphasized that the recovery process would take time, but that he was confident that the community would come back stronger than ever.
