20251231 144226 That is something that we can do. All right, on the flip side, are there any habits people should stop pretending that they'll suddenly master in January? Yes, yes. These fatter diets that we want to go on, these intense workout plans, we want to workout five days for the week, two hours each day. These rigid routines. Listen, if you love pizza and you decide that I'm going to cut up pizza altogether, that makes no sense to me because what's going to happen? You're going to take a month from pizza and then you're going to buy a whole pizza and donate in just a few minutes. And that is why I say you should diet in such a way. It shouldn't be a diet. It should be such a way even such a way that is fitting to your life including things that you like but of course mainly with those healthy options so it's a balance and it's what you mostly do that affects your body okay well good talk
