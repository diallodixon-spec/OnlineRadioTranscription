20251222 140610 We drive one car at a time, but I still want to But I still want to Now that we get to the truth, truth, truth, I just wanna live good Look, the sun could shine the same time with the moon Boy, I could only drive on car at a time But I still want too But I still want two We come out the shelter the party, just watch When last you been to a party Plenty women looking so nice We must be in paradise When last you had a time to remember It's only Bumper to fend off
