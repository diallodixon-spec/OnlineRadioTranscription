============================================================

Even though time may find me somebody new You were my real love, you were my real love I never knew love till there was you From the bottom of my broken heart Never looked back, he say How was I to you? They say in this world Nothing lasts forever But I don't believe that's true Cause the way that I feel when we're together I know that's the way I'll always feel for you
