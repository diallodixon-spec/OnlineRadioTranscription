20260102 092614 I'm going to agree there now for someone Kimmy who for someone traveling outside of Jamaica for the very first time what are your top three most must know excuse me tips so what what should somebody who has never traveled before it's the first time they're going to come out you know step out of Jamaica what is the three must know things okay one, don't travel to countries with connection or require you to connect. For first-time travelers, I suggest direct flights. Right. I agree. It can be confusing trying to catch another flight, getting to another gate. So first-time travelers definitely do not book connecting flights. Another thing I would suggest is having cash as well as card and advise your bank before you leave the island because a lot of people they travel and funds their bank account is on hold because the bank is not notified.
