I'm hoping that this will be the introduction to him and I work together to actually build boxing to do more, especially for the kids in Jamaica. He has his school there over on Hanover side in the summer and the boxing club. So he does have an outreach program there, but that's a one-week, two-week event in the summer. What can we do to give the kids the platform to host eight, nine shows, kind of like what I'm doing in Canada, to actually build these kids up? And maybe with Lennox as my partner, we could open up some of those doors and get the corporate support that we would need to run a platform like that. Mr. Tyler Boxer, founder and president of the United Boxing Promoters Inc. Thank you very much, sir, for giving us the information here.
