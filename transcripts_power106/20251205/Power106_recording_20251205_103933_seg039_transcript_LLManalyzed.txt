We changed the constitution overnight to suit what we want. But any time it's going to leak certain people, we just hang on, hang on. What these people have been doing to this country, the people that are buying the thing, the people that have destroyed it, it is costing us too much. It's shocked the system. You with me? Now, we'll move on to where we are now with this economy I don't know I everyday I'm more confused because the prime minister come to Parliament he make an announcement when he asked for specifics he said the minister bring it next week the minister come you ask for specifics, you say the minister will bring it next week. The minister comes, you ask him for specifics, he doesn't know. You say okay, go to the PAC, the technocrat, you ask them, they say they don't know. So who knows really? That's a very serious situation. Yeah man, I agree.
