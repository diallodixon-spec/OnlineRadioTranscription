20251215 174229 I adore you. I adore you. And the God, my Savior, reigns above me. I adore you, I adore you. He's shining on you, Lord. Jesus, you bring all the world to me. I adore You, Lord. You saw me And through your love I have been set free. Now I am not the same. Took my sin and shame. Forever I will bless your holy name.
