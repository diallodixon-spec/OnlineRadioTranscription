20251226 173013 Number 11, Darwin at 14 to 1, and number 12, Fidelity. First time Lasix, 8 to 1. So again, very competitive race, and it's competitive because none of these horses have gone the journey. They're very young. It's like taking some 17-year-olds, and they've all been sprinting, and you're putting them in, you know, they've all been running running 100 meter and you put them in a 400 meter race. That's the equivalent. You know, you don't know who will go the journey, but I'm going to go with the outside horse, first time Lasix. And it would be nice for Jason to win the trophy in name of his father. It looks like Robert Halladine normally gets the better horses but in this case I think Fidelity will be the one to beat even though Halladine is not riding that one. Again number one the favorite
