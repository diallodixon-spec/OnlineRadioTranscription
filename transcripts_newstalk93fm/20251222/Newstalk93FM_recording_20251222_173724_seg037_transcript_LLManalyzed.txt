20251222 173724 I don't listen to nothing they say Every fact I draw Jumpin' up Doin' what I want Jumpin' up Tell them I ain't leavin' Right they are sleepin' They say I'm too out of control But it's too much action Somebody pour an extra my head's gone And I'm miserable All down on the ground I'm causing trouble Look how the security watch me They don't know about me I just mush up the place And I defect like a chumby I don't wait
