20251226 124130 Even though it gets much harder to come back I'm waiting in line Nobody gets too much love anymore It's as high as a mountain and harder to come back Love is such a beautiful thing You make my world a summer day Are you just a dream to me? Nobody gets too much heaven no one gets too much hell
