20251215 124733 For the name New Kingston, that place is dirty and smelly. And we have a lot of homeless people living in little areas where there's a garage or a little inlet in their buildings. Yes, it's a New Kingston. Yes. And a lot of garbage, garbage piled up by one of the banks and the car park was filled with garbage litter all over and smelling because I think the homeless people defecate and pass the urine in any little corner that they can. But all is not true in Zoom. When I walked past ICWI, and I must commend them, the place was like an oasis in a desert.
