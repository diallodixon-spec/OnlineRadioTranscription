20251219 101008 So the October, November, October, when school started back, the School of Architecture here opened at UTEC, and that's where we're broadcasting from, University of Technology School of Architecture. And we rebuilt little by little, little by little, and it happened again, but this time even worse. 37 years later, there seems to be a kind of 37-year cycle, but that's another story for another time. I have here with me though, as we attempt to rebuild and at the same time support and celebrate the structural integrity of the program here at UTEC in the School of Architecture. I have with me Mr. Andre Nelson and this is a man whose work and his organization have had a concrete impact on Jamaica. Andre Nelson from Carib Cement, CMex.
