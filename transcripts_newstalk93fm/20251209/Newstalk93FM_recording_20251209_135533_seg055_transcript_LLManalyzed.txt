============================================================

Sometimes we disagree, I'm mad at you on your backs with me, but still we always find a way to work things out. Sometimes I get on your nerves, sometimes you act absurd, but understanding is what love's about. Can you and me together, we can face anything? No opposition could erase what we built, just like the energizer bunny ever growing, ever slowing. So baby, let me love you. Why don't you come and love me forever more? Yeah, let me love you forever more. Forever more. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
