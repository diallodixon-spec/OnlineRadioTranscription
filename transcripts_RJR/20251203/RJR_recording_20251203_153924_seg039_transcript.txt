I think it's important, like anything else, if you're planning for a holiday, it's important to budget. Budgeting always kind of saves you. I tend to use my budgeting to save me.

No, I hear from some of them, you know, you say they go quiet, then they're about to crush, you know, but we want to save the money this Christmas. So January is not a dry month. Like I like I have a friend. Hey, we can tell when they go online, go shopping. Mm hmm. Yeah, man. After the shopping, you know, me notice certain movements and me say, me go go touch the road. You know, me not really, me not feel that this way.
