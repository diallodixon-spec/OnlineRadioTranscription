20260101 150202 is here with Irish Wish being drawn on the very inside. He has to be about three lengths better than this entire field. Six to five is what we get for Irish Wish. Happy Force number two is at nine. Little groovy thing, 47. Sticky Down, 67. Number five, Legal Bomb, that one is at 33 to one. Phoenix Risen is at five to two. Bugatti, my other pick, is at 17. 16 for Babla, 9 to 1 for Mamouche, 7 to 1 for Sensational Gold, and 7 to 2 for Sippin' on Sunshine. Again, fairly wide open race, but I'm going to go with Irish Wish or Bugatti. If Irish Wish can clear the field and come over to the middle, he has a very glorious chance of repeating his last win. We just have about three or four of them left to go in. Number six, Phoenix Risen is still out. So too is number 11, Sipping on Sunshine.
