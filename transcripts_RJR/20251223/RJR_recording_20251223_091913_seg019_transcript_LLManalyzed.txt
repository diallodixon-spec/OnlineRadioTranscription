20251223 091913 for a crossroad branch and then there is a gentleman trying to get the name of the gentleman name, but unsuccessful. Mr. Mullins, let me tell you something. When I say he's the greatest presenter, pastor and gift. Now, I have never seen a set of people so cooperative. As a matter of fact, when I went inside, the supervisor, Ms. Melvin, she asked what's the problem, I told her, and she tried the complete floor to get the password and email and everything, and then she couldn't get it. This gentleman, apparently, this guy, he's the supervisor, too. He came there and, you know, well, I'll wait, I'll wait. He said, watch out, man, and me, and you, me, I'll deal with it for the rest of the time, you know, and then I got to around three o'clock, right? So I want to come in there. I don't know the junkman's name, but I know the supervisor's name, Melville. Yes. Yes, sir. So as a matter of fact, I was trying to get them to find the name of the junkman who assists me. Right? So I got you with everything.
