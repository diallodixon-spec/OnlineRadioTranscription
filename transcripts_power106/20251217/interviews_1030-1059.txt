**National Security a Top Priority this Christmas Season**

In an exclusive interview on Radio Jamaica's "Hotline" program, State Minister of National Security and Peace, Juliet Cuthbert Flynn, emphasized the importance of prioritizing national security during the Christmas season. With the recent disruption caused by Hurricane Melissa, Minister Cuthbert Flynn assured listeners that the Jamaica Constabulary Force (JCF) will have a heightened presence in high-traffic areas, particularly in markets and shopping districts.

The Minister highlighted the increased number of police officers on the streets, with the JCF now boasting 14,000 men and women in uniform, up from 11,000 previously. This increased visibility, coupled with foot patrols, aims to make citizens feel safer and more secure during the holiday season.

When asked about the build-out of cameras, Minister Cuthbert Flynn acknowledged that Hurricane Melissa had disrupted some of the progress made, but assured that the project would continue, with the goal of making Jamaica's citizens feel as safe as possible.

The Minister also touched on the opportunity presented by the hurricane to rebuild and improve the country's infrastructure, including roads. She mentioned that the National Works Agency (NWA) has introduced a new program to give roadways a longer life, and that the government is looking to build back stronger, with a focus on durability and sustainability.

In a discussion about the impact of electricity outages on safety concerns, Minister Cuthbert Flynn acknowledged the challenges posed by the absence of electricity in some communities, which can lead to an increase in petty crimes. However, she assured that the JCF is working to address these concerns and keep citizens safe.

The interview concluded with Minister Cuthbert Flynn reiterating the government's commitment to national security and the safety of its citizens, particularly during the Christmas season.
