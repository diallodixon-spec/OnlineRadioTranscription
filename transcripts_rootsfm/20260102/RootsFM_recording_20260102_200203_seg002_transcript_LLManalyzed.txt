20260102 200203 You're a good friend, you're Mr. Smotherly Cup, but man, way out of the devil's hands. Even when you turn, some of you let off. Everywhere you go, you're a top of cash. Everywhere you go some is just the money, friend. All them causes feel rod-like. I tell them, if you want to know your friend, drop a pretend like you, then you woulda hear. Oh, my God! You know you're easy and cool, do what you need, turn a metna man right, you like me, we know we're friends. Different from we enemies, we know we friends. We friend them from way back when, we know we friend. Who not for sake, we again, we know we are friends. Baby, we ain't no stop tell them the truth. Life can be good too, it's not easy. You hear? When you have money.
