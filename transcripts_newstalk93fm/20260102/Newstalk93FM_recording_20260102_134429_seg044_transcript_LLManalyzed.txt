20260102 134429 Now, now, now Meet me on the mountain top I'll be in the shadow wind And wait for you to call it off Cause I don't want a boyfriend But we could be nice to each other Nice to each other Wrong for each other Right for each other And rise to each other Rise to each other Cause you know I don't know the classic stuff And it never works, you know it So can we say we'll never say the classic stuff to show it? What is sunlight talking all night? Just enough to grow it now
