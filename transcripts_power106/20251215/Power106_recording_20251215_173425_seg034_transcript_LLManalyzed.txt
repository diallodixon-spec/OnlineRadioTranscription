20251215 173425 And just yesterday You came around my way You changed my whole sin away With your astonishing beauty Oh, you couldn't make a broader scene No ordinary thing, a supernatural being And oh, you are brighter than the moon Brighter than the star, I love you just the way you are And you are my African Queen The girl of my dreams You take me where I've never been You make my heart go ding-a-ling-a-ling You are my African Queen The girl of my dreams You remind me of a thing And that is the African beauty You are my African queen
