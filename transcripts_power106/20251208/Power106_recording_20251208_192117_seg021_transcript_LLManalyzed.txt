I went back to the work I did with John Wertheim, the other investigator at Sports Illustrated who helped me expose these athletes. John Wertheim now is, you'll know him from 60 Minutes. He's a full-time employee of 60 Minutes and does all kinds of different reports well beyond sports. But what happened basically is this starting, Conti started working in track and field in 1990 and at that point he was, he started to give different kinds of steroids and perhaps human growth hormones, maybe not at that point yet to very high-profile track stars and also World Championship boxers. There's something here that you mentioned the year 1984. Yeah.
