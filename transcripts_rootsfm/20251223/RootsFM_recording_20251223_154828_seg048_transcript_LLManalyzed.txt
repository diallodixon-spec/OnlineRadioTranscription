20251223 154828 I was on the side, but who can stand when he's in the manhunt, even when he lands? I'm gonna dance, I'm gonna blow it around. So bring my strong advice, just remember to always think twice. Don't think twice! She told my baby to dance to three, two, and three. Then she hold a photo of me, baby, crying, crying words like I'm cold. Do a dance on the floor in the water, baby. People always told me, be careful what you do. Don't go around breaking young girls' hearts. Don't break no girl's heart. She came and stood right behind me. I thought that's manna sweet but beautiful. I guess it happens pretty soon. She's gone and she's gone. She's a pretty cheese, not my love.
