available through the grace of God and the sacrifice of His Son on the cross for your sins. When He calls you, that very moment is a time to respond. By the work of the Holy Spirit, you can feel Him drawing you. That call is too serious for you to casually delay or ignore. He holds the power, not you. When God calls, we realize there are really only two responses we can give, yes or no. The first one will open the door to all the blessings that God wants to bring to your life. The second is the path of self-destruction. Is he calling you today? How will you answer the call? Please join us next week. The preceding feature, A Word for Jamaica, was brought to you by Grace Missionary Church, 7 West Avenue, Kingston, 8.
