20251217 115429 suffering. You put up with our foolishness and with the times that we've even taken you for granted. You care about us even though we might not always show that we care about you. You give even when we don't deserve it. You show us what it really means to love. What it really means to have mercy. What it really mean to be gracious. And we're so sorry Lord for the times that we have wronged you, we've hurt others and in so hurt you. We have ignored your commandments and done our own thing following tradition over scripture. We're so sorry for the times when we have intentionally done our own thing. Done that thing we know is wrong. We sinned intentionally. We thought about it before we did it and we did it. And sometimes we didn't even feel bad about it. Right now I'm asking that you'll forgive us Father.
