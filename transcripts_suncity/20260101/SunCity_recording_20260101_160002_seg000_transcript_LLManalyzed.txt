20260101 160002 Hold me tight. Nobody left in this world to kiss good night. Good night. And where are you now? Now that I need you. Tears on my pillow. Wherever you go. I cry to your river. That lets you go around it I've never seen you fall apart And the words of a broken heart is just emotion that's taking me over Tied up in sorrow, lost in my soul But if you don't come back, come home to me, darling I know that there'll be nobody left in my soul. But if you don't come back, come home to me, darling. Know that there ain't nobody left in this world to hold me tight. Nobody left in this world, to kiss good night. Good night.
