Whatever they put it, whatever little tie-up tie-up they have, money blow away. I was talking to somebody, they end up rescuing a couple of people while in the community. And the day after Hurricane, I saw one of the men look, look, look, run where the remnants of the house, they look. He wouldn't tell anybody what I'm looking for. And then go back the next day, they look, they look, the look, the look. Only to find out, say, Melissa gone with money. So I don't know how much people have to buy anything because people are actually storing more cash than we'd ever imagine. And it gone. Just like how the bird then when Melissa take with Melissa take with money. You can imagine. The man might be really balling over him, hosing about him, look and see him little savings.
