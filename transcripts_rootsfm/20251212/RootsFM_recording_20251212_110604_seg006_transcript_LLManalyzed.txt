2025-12-12 14:52:00 You're in tune to Roots 96-1 on the FM band. Spectrum Management Authority is where we are for our outside broadcast. It's the second annual health and wellness fair. Unity in a disability. I love it, I love it. Community treat. And of course it's a pleasure to be here as we focus on wellness, promoting health and wellness. And I have two amazing guests here with me at this time. I have Dr. Lekeem Samaj, public scholar, social philosopher talk show.
