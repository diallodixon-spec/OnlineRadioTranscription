Don't go going downtown with any high yield and the money counting in your hand and your phones in your hand. Be careful when you're spending your money. If you can do less online shopping, if you're not sure of the website, will anybody rent you any property online? All of those things. Scamming, et cetera. It's important that we take care of ourselves and take care of the money that we work hard for. Absolutely. Because they're willing to take it from us and they have no mercy when they're taking it. They want to take it all. The police will continue giving you more information about your safety, about your community, about we the police ourselves and the services that we offer as we serve the persons within the St. Andrew's South Division. We want to thank Roots 96.1 FM for being in partnership with us the police and giving us a chance to tell the community
