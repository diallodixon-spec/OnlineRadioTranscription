20251216 120506 Ready for the rum, ready, ready for the rum Ready, ready, for the rum Ready for the action, come! This sweating spirit havin' me feelin' good I have a linin' spirit Early in the mornin', I had it Me cooler ready, me ice done ready Me punching that's automatic I have a lining jumbie A kind of energy inside me And it ready for the rum Ready, ready for the rum, ready, ready, for the rum Ready for the action, a spiritual encounter In me soul taking over Telling me to start up the drinking And do away with good behaviour So let we go, let we go down the road Let we go, it's action time Let we go, It's bacchanal time Let we go! Hands up! Wo yo yo yo yo, wo yo yo yo
