20251229 201411 I have a lightning spirit Early in the morning I had it Me cooler ready, me ice done ready Me punching that's automatic I have a lightning jumbie A kind of energy inside me And it ready for the rum Ready ready for the rum, ready ready for the rum ready for the a spiritual encounter In me soul faking over Telling me to start up me drinking And do away with good behaviour So let we go, let we go down the road Let we go, it's action time, let we go It's back-and-on time let we go Hands up! This sweating spirit of me feeling good!
