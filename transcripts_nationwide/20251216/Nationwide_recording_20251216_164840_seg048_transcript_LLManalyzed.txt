20251216 164840 We called, we chained our hearts in vain We jumped, never asking why We kissed, I fell under your spell A love no one could deny Don't you ever say I just walked away I will always want you I can't live a lie running for my life I will always want you I came in like a wrecking ball I never hit so hard enough All I wanted was to break your walls All you ever did was wreck me Wow! She really takes time with this song. She doesn't take time with this song
