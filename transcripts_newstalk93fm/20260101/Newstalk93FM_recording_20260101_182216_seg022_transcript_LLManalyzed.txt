20260101 182216 I'm swimming in the cold. Tennessee champagne, anything goes. We be doing squats on the yacht, ghost, ghosting. Summer on the ocean. No, we ain't boasting. We be ducked off, no internet posting. We just don't think I ain't notice. Trippie get a money loop. They focus, friend. We ain't like them if he don't spend. We don't like him spending on 10. Counting up M's, that's my kin. We so locked in, ayy. But that's all we have not damn. We like seeing out the mirror. And we in hot demand. We the ones with the motion. Funnels on Brazilian. Bodi on Samoan. Bye. You know we ain't finna say hi. If my twin ain't feeling your vibe. If my ass shit a lot. We don't switch sides. Friend.
