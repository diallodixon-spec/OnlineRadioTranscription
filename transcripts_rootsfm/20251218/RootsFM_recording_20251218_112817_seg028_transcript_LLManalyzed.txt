20251218 112817 yeah you bought it from me but I stole it from Alicia outside you'd be charged you know you would have purchased not knowing that I stole it from yeah me not really understand that because you did not know you but lack of knowledge is no excuse you could have had that one or you want you get a new one or you want to get rid of the older one that lack of knowledge is not excuse because the constitutional law made no provision for lack of knowledge, you know. Because if that was the case, can you imagine all of us lack knowledge? So you can't put that loophole when it comes to law. Because lacking of knowledge, that would be an escape route for criminals. If we were to use lack of knowledge, mark you, some lack of knowledge are legitimate because you really don't know. But if you use that as a loophole, then you can't just use it for you. You have to use it for the entire universe. So can you imagine everybody's lack of knowledge?
