20251219 121612 here are my mother and my brothers for whoever does the will of god is my brother and sister and mother. The gospel of Mark chapter three, 34 to 35. The theme for today will be doing the will of God. It is a great honor to be called a child of God and to be a part of his family. No matter where you go or who you are, you will always be God's family. All believers are children of God and God is always good to them. Families are wonderful and important.
