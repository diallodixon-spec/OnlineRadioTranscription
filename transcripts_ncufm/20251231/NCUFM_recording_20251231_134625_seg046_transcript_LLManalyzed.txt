20251231 134625 Today is Wednesday, December 31. I'm Pastor Robert Wright. Thank you again listeners for your company. Today we focus on the topic Paul and Colossee, the church at Colossee. That's the city, Colossee. The church is called the Colossian Church. Heavenly Father, thank you for another beautiful day. Again, as we come to the end of the year, we pray, Lord, that you will continue to be with us. Bless us today and into the new year as well. Do bless us now as we study, as we share, in Jesus' name. So, we have no record of Paul ever visiting Colossae, which again tells us something about the effectiveness of evangelistic strategy. First, it was Epaphras, a resident of Colossae, who brought the Gospel to that city, Colossians 1 verse 7. But how was he converted? Most likely, it was in the mid-15th century.
