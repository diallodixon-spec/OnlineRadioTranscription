20251224 140708 It's Philly Wednesday right here on the drive on NCU 91 FM. And today we're also, you know, getting a bit extra festive, you know. We're on the eve of Christmas Day, for those of you who celebrate Christmas. And you know, whether you're relaxing, whether you're traveling or just tuning in for the vibes, thank you for choosing us, you know? And I know that it's getting a bit extra hectic right about now. I just want you to stay locked in, stay filled with purpose, and stay joyful. You know, because we have a lot of good music, some positive energy and a show just for you right here on the drive. Yes man, because guess what, today is over day you know. Over days, few we went the same way. Have some music strictly local today. Hope you enjoy, have a nice line up for you.
