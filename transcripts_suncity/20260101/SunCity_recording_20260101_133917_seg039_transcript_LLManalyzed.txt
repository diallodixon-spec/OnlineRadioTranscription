20260101 133917 I've been remembering the good times that we used to share. My thoughts of you don't have an ending. Memories of you are everywhere. But what should I tell you? It's not your concern. Your wisdom, your listen. Well, I'm lost in diamond. Dis I'm so lonely, with no place to turn. And I need help. Yes, I need help. The lonely head stays on my side.
