20251226 190301 There's also the Jamaica Learning Passport. For the Christmas holidays, students and parents can engage with festive stores and activities like the Seven Days of Christmas for LaCara and her brother, Jaden, as they go on a Christmas adventure. Just as we run a summer series called Summer Spark with simple storylines and word problems for different age groups, we've done one this year for Christmas that recounts a family's journey from one point of Jamaica to another to experience all the different Christmas traditions that we know and love. Engage in the stories if you can visit the platform, look at the images, listen to the audio so the stories are both written and there's voice over.
