20251229 095041 On the edge of your knife Staying drunk on your vibe The angels up in the clouds Are jealous knowing we've found Something so out of the ordinary You got me kissing the ground Of your sanctuary Shatter me when you touch Oh Lord, return me to dust The angels up in clouds Are jealous jealous knowing we've found. Hopeless hallelujah. Holy sight of heaven's gate. Oh, my life, I'll do ya. Breathe it, take my breath away. At your altar, I will pray. You're the sculptor, I'm the clay. Oh, my, my, you're taking me out of the ordinary. I want you laying me down so we're dead and buried.
