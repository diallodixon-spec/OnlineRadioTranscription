20260101 123227 Keep it together, but I'm falling apart I'm feeling all out of my element Throwing things, trying, trying to figure out where the hell I went Wrong, the pain reflected in the soul Can't even have a word, I'm feeling inside I need you, need you back in my life, baby When you left, I lost a part of me And it's still so hard to believe Come back, baby, please Cause we belong together Who else am I gonna leave? No one times get around Who else gonna talk to me? When the phone to the sun comes out Who else gonna take you place? There ain't nobody man Oh, baby, baby We belong together, baby, baby, we belong together, baby When you left, I lost a part of me It's still so hard to believe Come back, baby, please, cause we belong together Am I gonna leave now? We're tired, get up
