20251219 113820 time in music, Keznamdi. Oh, congratulations to Keznamdi, Grammy nominee. Yeah, we're very, very proud and very, we're still in awe. I'm telling you. Because, you know, the little journey, you know, has become that part of the journey. And, you know, it's an excellent album, right? Excellent album. Give thanks, my sister. It's true. Give thanks. So we will see, and February 1 will be the time of decision. But whichever way, it's still a victory nomination is a big deal. So I feel like this is part of a validation of the concept that maybe, you know, in the time and, you know, we will come forward around as veterans in the music industry with albums, four, five, six albums that have not been released yet. And so we still are excited about bringing that forward to the world. I would have heard it live on
