20251217 195826 If you ever need me I will be there Doesn't matter where, no where I will be there Say you can call anytime you need Not all the love, but we have it real I know my dark seasons change My daughter talks with all the rage I didn't know much time passed Me keep you closest to my heart And when your life get lonely, please don't say you can't phone me. And if you ever need me, tell me you love me.
