20251224 161509 and all on me I see the presents underneath the good old Christmas tree and I'll wait on light till Santa comes to wake me from my dreams oh why, cause that's Christmas to me I see the children play outside like angels in the snow while mom and daddy share a kiss under the mistletoe. And we'll cherish all these simple things wherever we may be. Oh, why? Because that's Christmas to me. I've got this Christmas song in my heart I've got the candles glowing in the dark I'm hanging all the stockings by the Christmas tree
