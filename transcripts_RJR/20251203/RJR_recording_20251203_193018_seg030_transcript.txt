The recovery efforts following Hurricane Melissa have demonstrated the resilience and strength of our communities. As we gather this Yuletide season to celebrate, reflect, and enjoy the holiday cheer, it's important to prioritise safety and responsibility for all. Join us this Thursday on JCF Now for an engaging conversation with the Peaside Safety Boss, Dr. Gary McKenzie, Assistant Commissioner of Police, as he shares essential road, personal, and property safety tips for the busy season. We will also discuss the significance of permits for public events, why they are important, and how proper planning ensures the safety of patrons, organizers, and the communities. That's JCF Now, 8 p.m. to 9 p.mpm on Radio Jamaica 94 FM. Let's be wise as we celebrate Christmas 2025. And that makes the Time 7.30 time for the Jamaica Magazine being aired in time allotted for government broadcasts.
