We'll stay with you until 2 o'clock this afternoon on this Good Good Friday. Alright, got some messages. But let me take this call first before I go to the messages. Smitty, good afternoon. Hey, Mr. Simon, Merry Christmas, man. Merry Christmas to each and everyone. Same to you, my brother. What's up? Merry Christmas to the Portland lady.
