20251219 155425 I'm coming back to the reason that I first believed Coming back to that hour of freedom I received So take my heart, surrender, take every part of me And drown me in the water, till it's only you I see Come and drown me in the world Till there's only You I see in me Hallelujah! Praise to the Lord! God you've been great Praise to the Lord You're so fair Praise to the Lord Hallelujah!
