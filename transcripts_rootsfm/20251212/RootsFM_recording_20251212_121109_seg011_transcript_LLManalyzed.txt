20251212 121109 I've seen Alyssa also. She dip, she move and groove. And and at the time she were. Oh, they're okay. So, we're we're going to be having prayer line coming up shortly and of course, we, my dear, what's her name? Latoya? Latoya will be praying for the community coming up shortly. And of course I must say good afternoon to the High Hall Burn Street Basic School, and of course to the principal, Rich Gart. She's here this afternoon in terms of being a part of this celebration. It's a good feeling, it's a family vibe, and I tell you, I love it. I love it. Somebody just mentioned about Re-Tone. Re-Tone is just around the corner. And where is Anatole? Because I'm curious to know.
