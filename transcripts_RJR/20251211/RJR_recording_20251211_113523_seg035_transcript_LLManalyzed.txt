There was a gulf between, there was a variance between the minister's prepared text and indeed the order. But if I may, the fundamental point of departure here is that if I understood Mr. Powell correctly, what he's saying is that were a PNC administration to have been at the wicket, they would have, A, sought to renegotiate, and the prospects for that would have been bleak, given the context of the existing license. And if the JPS score would not have been amenable to it, it would have exercised certain options, which would have had certain ramifications, meaning telegraph to the JPS that we're not gonna have a license with you after this. Why would the government seem to lock itself into that kind of position rather than allowing the license, essentially, to get to a point where you can renegotiate terms with the existing licensee or facilitate the bringing on of a new service provider altogether? This is not in Jamaica's best interest.
