20251223 173118 So but be safe, enjoy the Christmas season. I went into a taxi yesterday, twice, two different taxis. And the way they're driving, I said, no man, I can't be in charge of these people. I can't be your leader. They're driving. I just said it too honestly then, within two minutes, he questioned a man, called back to New Kingston. Within two minutes, the way he was acting. So we had to be safe. We lost 366 persons since the start of the year. We've got about 4% over last year. Please, for heaven's sake, keep it easy on our roads and have a Merry Christmas. All right, Edith and Will, thank you very much. It's always a pleasure to have you. And this is the last time that we're going to speak to each other for this year. So we just want to thank you for your time that you have shared with us and to just wish you all the best for 2026. Thank you very, very much for having me this year and look forward to a new year 2026. We're all going to be in the mix. Bless you. Definitely. Have a good one.
