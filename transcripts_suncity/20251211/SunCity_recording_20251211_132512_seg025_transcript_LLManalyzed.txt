============================================================

I'm breathing fine. You're crazy, and I'm out of my mind. Cause all in me loves all of you. Love your curves and all your edges. All perfect imperfections Give your all to me I'll give my all to you You're my end and my beginning Even when I lose I'm winning Cause I give you all of me. And you give me all of you, all of you. Give me all of you.
