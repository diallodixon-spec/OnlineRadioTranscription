20251219 141509 Good afternoon to you. Ah yes, I see some songs coming in already. Yes man, kick back and relax. We have our Daily Devotion coming up at 2.30, faxing 5 at 3, 3.30 is homework help us and then the bus list at 4.15 and then we get ready to pull up the handbrake at 5. So yes when I see I see the requests coming in the first 15 I see them coming in. Gonna start off with the faster triplets, bigger than my circumstance. For that though, I'm gonna be taking a quick break on the wellness bite. So keep back, relax and enjoy.
