20251212 183219 I'm gonna get carried away When I get carried away Oh, while I pass the clouds and shout so loud It may sound like thunder My tearful eyes may fill the skies Till it looks like rain When I leave this world, pass the gates of Pearl And stand before my savior I'll let my soul let the glory roll my life is over I'm gonna get carried away when I get carried away
