It was an odd deal. Oh boy. You give me a joke this morning Chris, I'll go and check it out as soon as I come off here. So Miss Enid signs him. What a thing. Anyway, I have to run for the news, sir. Thank you for that one. Run, run, run. Thank you very much. Hey, our judges go through some things, you know. Some things that they have to use in good time and adjudicate on. Anyway, you people in the chat, when you must behave on yourself. Here, when you must go on a bit of a big people. Where there's a compound, a visa, something like that. This has been a good morning of mirth. It's been a mirthful morning.
