20260101 123716 I'm breaking inside for something sure that I could not see. I'll add it all when me like you do, baby Every time I'm with someone Loving you and I wanna run I wanna run back to your arms again There's no one in the world Loves me like you do. Please take me back, please take me back. Oh baby can't go on. I can't go on, I'm unhappy, I'm unhappy like you.
