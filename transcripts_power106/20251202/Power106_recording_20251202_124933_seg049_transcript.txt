I don't know how much a dry coconut is going to cost in the West. I don't know what a jelly is going to sell for next year. And I don't see, you see, I always say it's best to have good plans and don't have the money,'t have the money and don't have a good plan. I don't see where the parliamentarians are keeping together with places like the church and all the social people that put me in an arm. And I have never seen so much homeless people in all my life. So much displaced people sleeping. You'd never think that this is Jamaica.
