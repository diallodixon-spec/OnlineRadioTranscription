Welcome back to the musical vibes right here in Sun City. Ready with the difference. My name is Sun Jock Ali Patch. Yeah. In control all the way until 7.30 p.m. afterwards. Sun Jock Yumi will be taking over. Gotta be mixing this segment with some songs for the ladies and also some songs about righteousness, conscious vibes. Yeah, yeah, a mixture of everything. At 7.30 we have the JIS News followed by the gospel segment slash Christmas segment. We're at one ten. Come on, big up to the price, right?
