And the man run the bucket tonight, you know, and the back door where they send me pour, dig out the things, so the water travel come down, nowhere, all the carbo stem burst up, you know. And you know, so the water take me now, you know. We come out of the house, still have the good things, but everything in my shop, like mud, take it up and they hands them, I will take the maggots and then the lizard them, I tax the ants for maggots. Full of food. They would come. Water commission would come. I was born in 1953. I lived all my life. Look after my mother till she died. Look after my father. Look after everybody. I didn't take no visa. I had my pride. I had five years of coffee there. And none of it was picked up. Because nobody wanted to come down to one place there. You should have some bread and plant, corn and sweet corn, everybody have it.
