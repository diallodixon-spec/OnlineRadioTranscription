Festival and Farmers Market, Saturday November 29 at the Larston Crossing, Spanish Town, St. Catherine from 1 to 3 p.m. right you there? Yeah, man. Um, I think it would be great if you could have experienced the coronation bingy when his majesty was crowned and 72 nations attend the coronation. And you have the symbols that was given to him. And we re-enact it every year. And that children from youth university and other schools go over and stay home.
