20251226 151009 Honey sipping on some Chardonnay The sex is even better when she's feeling that way All I wanna do right now is love our town I don't give a damn about who hears the sound We'll be in the groove until the sun comes up Together we'll get lost inside the rush Let's make a love scene Steamy and blue Erotic memories For an audience of two And we'll make a love scene Let the foreplay begin And replay each moment Again and again and again But your blues is just about ready for us We step into the water and you tremble at my touch
