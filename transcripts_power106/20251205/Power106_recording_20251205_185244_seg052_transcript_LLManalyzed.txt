But they had a terrible start and since then they've been able to turn things around very, very well, both domestically and in Europe in the UEFA Champions League. I think that Arsenal having figured their top defenders out and Villa playing the way that they are, Villa can, at home, get the better of this Arsenal team. And I think that with Martinez in goal doing so very, very well, I think that Villa are equipped to really get this win tomorrow at home. We shall see what we shall see, certainly. All right, and at 10 o'clock tomorrow,
