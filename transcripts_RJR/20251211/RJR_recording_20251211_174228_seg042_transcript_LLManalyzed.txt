2025-12-11 19:02:21 under the Firearms Act. In Jamaica, you can't get that expunged. Or you committed one of those lot of scamming offenses. In Jamaica you can't get those expunged. But if you had committed them elsewhere, and that country allows for expungement, what the bill is saying is that you will be allowed to have it expunged here. But a Jamaican who commits the very same offense that you did, but commits it here in Jamaica, will not be able to get it expunged. And I am of the strong view that that does not promote equality before the law. It's almost as if you're giving preferential treatment to persons who commit offenses outside of Jamaica, as opposed to those who committed the very same offense here. So, in fact, I don't even know that if it will be capable of standing up to scrutiny if someone were to take it before the court. Because again, it, in my view, provides for differential treatment for the very same offense. That is not consistent with the whole print
