Never ever change No we never switch, no we never miss, no we never itch none, doll Cause we are very rich, so sleep, we're gonna mix this beat over this vocal We're gonna take that attack from the snake in the grass Dry stuff with paper, we take it to heart Hate and attack, them fake from the start, but we still a head straight to the top From morning, we a hustle and put we all in When we work, we not free, not stalling From morning, yeah, that's how we stay We never ever change We never ever change As how we stay, we not change, not at all Forget to get to 24 do nothing strange on a tile bug a girl I wrote a few and name them a call but that no make with strain on a time Move on in some new song stick to the right not try to do wrong opposite the table
