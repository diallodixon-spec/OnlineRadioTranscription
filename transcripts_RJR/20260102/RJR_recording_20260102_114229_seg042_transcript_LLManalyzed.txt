20260102 114229 you had a good Christmas season, Miss Joyce. Yeah, well. And all the best for 2026. As long as I'm not, as long as I'm in good health. Okay, give thanks. It will be good. May I ask you what one thing Jamaicans must stop doing in 2026, now? Yes. Yeah? We have an illegal thing, say clappers, right? For clappers. And every year, it is, I have a neighbor would watch and if I should tell you they call me one neighbor said she thought thief was coming through our window somebody thought the house was going over and we have it on and I intend to get somebody from the law book to let me have a copy because we say it is illegal and every year is the same thing. It goes on and on. But they start from before Christmas, and I know that they're carrying it on, and it is illegal.
