It's like a hymn get nominated Watch the Grammy side of me Cause how much people can you say Would feed you when you hungry When you brought them bless you with money But have been so fortunate. Surrounded by so many people, make sure I say me gone pathetic. And them they think me can't forget. Your daughter and me daughter wants me living, she no happy friend.
