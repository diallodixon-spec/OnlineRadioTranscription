20251222 093222 I go take the blade I just want you to come and rise it up Just a little whine there now Come and meet me at the end of the truck and we rev it up Say cool day, keep throwing it back at the way you stopped us Baby no way, we could pose up all the pictures you want When you're ready I could overshare knowledge You could overdo it But we compete in the middle and start a back-and-all Play in the middle, hey What we gon' do now? Jam to a rhythm, yeah Heat a carnival But we be heat, hey What we go do now? Start a wine on it I say compromise on it Baby, spend time on it I said compromise on it We start a compromise on it. Baby, spend time on it. I said compromise on it.
