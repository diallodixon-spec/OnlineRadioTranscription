They offer a sales promotion in my opinion. Then later when you have issues you are told that the plan no longer exists. Then they offer a similar package which costs twice or more than what you had in order to fix the problem. It's not only the phone plans, it's also related to television broadcast packages for listeners from Maypen. Remember, Starlink is enabling both flow and digital services, so it's not free. Alright, that's true.
