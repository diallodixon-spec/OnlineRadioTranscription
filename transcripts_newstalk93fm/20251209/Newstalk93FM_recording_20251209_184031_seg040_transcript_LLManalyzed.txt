When the party's on, we not satisfied, we go to the next one again We just play, but we never play a-hating On the road we celebrating, everybody congregating We just play but we never play-a-hating on the road we celebrating Everybody conversating We going for days, and then for days We going for, for days and days and days And then for days and days And going for days and days For days and days, we going for For days, and days, and days And days, and days and days It's still a catch, we went one foot on the fence And one on the ground And because we energy up so high And we don't want to come down Could be even a take, we do in the storm If we're sure about punting, we won't be in the storm We just play, but we never play a-hating On the road we're celebrating, everybody congregating We don't play but we never play aheading On the road, we're celebrating Everybody conversating, we go in for days
