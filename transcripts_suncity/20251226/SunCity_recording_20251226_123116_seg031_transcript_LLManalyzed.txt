My uncle said when I'm bailing, when my family go for clarity, you don't want to hear the cries of the people they put up on or something. Make matters worse, me hear say half of the thing they missing, and me know say a customs. Girl, how you know say a customs? Lisa, stop going like you're not having a sense, man. You don't see everybody talk about it in the media? You don't want to stop listening to hearsay? You ever experience that? Customs don't go in your package, suitcase, barrel or cargo unless you ship the item or the agent, stand up right there
