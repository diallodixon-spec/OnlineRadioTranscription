My bad, my bad, trippin on you Trippin on you My bad my bad for tripping on you Tripping on you I'm cool when I'm waiting But I act too cool when I don't need And I'm steady bruisin' just to save this But I tripped on your love, now I'm addicted And that's all I love, ain't tryna waste it Like we be runnin' them out and never make it That's just too bitter for words, don't wanna taste it That's too bitter for words don't wanna face it But I think that I'm done trippin', I'm trippin', trippin' I've been sippin', that's how I control It's feelin' it, keep givin'
