The party has started So I'm looking for somebody When a girl come tell me Come dance with me I know you could do it Come on, let's try it Let me see your hand in the air When you're back I say to fling back to red. Hands up. Because you let me put time to let go. Hands up. Come on, let me dance. Go, go. Prove it wrong in a sofa. Let's do this so fast. Go, go, go. Follow me.
