20251217 204630 I see you walking by, girl, you're looking so fine Trying to stop you in your tracks to tell you what's on my mind In no matter if you neglect me one more time Cause before the night's done, baby, girl, you'll be mine You have two mountains I wanna climb I wanna take you back home and test you with slime Out one night's time, girl, it's not a crime But if you I gotta get paid, gotta find me a sexy girl. Listen, believe me, baby, you look fine. I want you, you gotta be mine, baby. You look fine, I want you to be mine mine Baby, you look fine I want you to be mine, baby You look fine, I want you You gotta be mine Miss world, me eyes here for a long time It seems like everywhere you go that's where the sun shine I want to penetrate your mind with some strong rhyme
