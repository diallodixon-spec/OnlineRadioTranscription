So we need to investigate. Is it carrot or carrot sticks? Carrot sticks, yeah. Because it's not real carrot. Yeah, some sticks, yeah man. Some sticks, you're right. So we'll need to investigate it more to see what is behind this. If that is in fact, sorry, it is only for Trinidad and Tobago. Because Trinidad is getting real hell. Yeah man. They are getting carrot. I don't know if the rest of us are getting carrots or carrot sticks. Yep, yep, they? Trinidad, you're sitting on the plate of Venezuela. Your oil actually sits on the Plate of Venezuela. Trinidad, for those who don't know, is not on the same plate as Tobago. Tobago is Caribbean. Trinidad sits on the geological plane. It literally sits on that plane, which is why they have oil.
