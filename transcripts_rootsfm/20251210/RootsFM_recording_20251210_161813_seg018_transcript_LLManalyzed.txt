When you want all the love you deserve And the heat's on your mind Don't you even think about it I'll be there just to wrap around you I can't hold back what I feel inside. It's just a fact that you should be mine. Anything you want. You got your thought about my love, your thought about me. You should be mine Anything you want You got your boy by my love Your boy by me And you won't, won't won't And you won't won't won't
