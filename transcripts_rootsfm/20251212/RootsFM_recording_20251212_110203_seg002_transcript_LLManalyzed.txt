2025-12-12 14:43:34 right here on our outside broadcast of Spectrum Management Organization. Hey, give it a lot on your station roots. The un-staffable radio station. Yes. Africa. Normal radio station right now dropping this particular vibe. If you know not from whence you came, you are doomed to live in shame. We have a few giveaways in ISIS. I don't know what exactly we're gonna be giving away today, but we're gonna be having a few giveaways. And of course, I was told about one particular artist, ISIS, that will be coming down there to entertain us. I'm not sure who the artist is, if the artist will be flying in from the United States of America. You know that would be good though. I express flight. Have you ever been on an express plane before? No. Something wrong with you. You want to know?
