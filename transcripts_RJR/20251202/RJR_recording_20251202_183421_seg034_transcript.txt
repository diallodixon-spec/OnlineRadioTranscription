Thank you so much for staying with us. We continue with you on Beyond the Headlines. I'm Dionne Jackson Miller. And Salah says that's true, but because I know Springfield and St. Elizabeth, well, maybe one is in St. James. One is certainly in St. James, Salah. All right. And a listener says, Dionne, they need to give the exact location in the districts that the drops will be made because I'm in Burt Savannah and I haven't seen them and that's why I was saying listener that they need to give more information. This information is available and they could have designed something a little better than this in terms of putting it out. This has a pretty little look you know the different boxes and the different colors and whatever but i think people i mean you all right so you do this but then you put up the the excel sheet as well so people can dig in as you say the community plus the areas in which they're doing
