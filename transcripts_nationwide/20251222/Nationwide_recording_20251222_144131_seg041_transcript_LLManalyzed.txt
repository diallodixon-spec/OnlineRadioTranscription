20251222 144131 Would you believe me if I told you Will you believe me when I say Affairs of the heart Together we've grown We're forever apart All I want you to know Is your love is life changing And I couldn't be the same without you darling Your love is life saving You always catch me when I fall When the tour bus drop off and all light lock off And I'm a mere mortal again A mortal bellicule and all the fans gone home I'm glad that you're more than a friend When your love is life-changing And I couldn't be the same without you darling
