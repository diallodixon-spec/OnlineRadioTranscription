What I do on camera, help me with what I do. Oh, it's the opposite. Okay, okay. While I'm on the set doing what I'm doing, instead of going back to the dressing room, I usually see what the cameramans are doing. Yeah. See what the director is doing. See what the actual producer is doing. Find out the best equipment to get, you know what I mean? So I can pursue it. And my thing that I'm doing is strictly for the ghetto youths. So if you're a ghetto youth and you want to do that type of stuff, the next movie, anyone is welcome as long as they can not look into the camera when I'm filming. Right? You're acting like you're looking straight into the camera. And that too, I love that you brought that up. So, um, how do people get in contact with you? Where do they go to, to see, to even see your work, you know? Well, I'm an IG, you know what I mean? Uh, I, I don't know all the places, but you can.
