20251218 172214 Somehow you saw a masterpiece. You changed my whole life. You made my world right, Lord. I never know why. Oh, God, I want to know. Thank you, Lord. Nothing. You made something out of nothing With my head held high and my hands lifted in the air I give you all the praise You're the only one that could've let me out of this maze And what you saw in in me, I don't know. But Lord, I'm glad that you saw it. And every piece of me that was a mystery. Oh, I want you someday.
