20251226 165425 The five star, 149,827. So you know it's gonna be a lovely pick six. That's it. That's the end of the results, the payouts for race number nine. And coming back to the winner's enclosure, number one, Blood Moon. Until the result is official, it's back to Krasonic. Make me dream, buy on the bar, the car we all got come. A smooth, smooth line, the doctor said me a black lung. Eh, rule boy, we're not that dumb. We're the ones, we're the ones. We still have not really done. Rude sound, too many in a one. Phenomenal like ninja. You wanna know how my go and go right and look on a color. Need to be like barber to salon. Think sweet like Mary Salman. Me no fear no man. Every man bad and good on the capital.
