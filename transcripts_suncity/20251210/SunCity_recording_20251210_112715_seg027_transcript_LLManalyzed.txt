============================================================

That time is now I'm done picking up the pieces No longer looking from the creases I've gotta save myself If not me, then who else? No longer walking in the shadows I've learned to love me more than anyone else And I will never be the same again Making boundaries I'm making boundaries Walls so thick that you won't climb Lying so long that you can't find my heart Will never be something for anyone to share
