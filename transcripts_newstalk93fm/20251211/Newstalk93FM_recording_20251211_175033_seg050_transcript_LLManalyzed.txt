Fly up and sail on my way to you. Deep as the blue sea, your love's going into me. And even though the waves out from this love will stay with me, deep as the dark blue, yeah? Kavaka and me. Oh, oh, oh, oh. So accurate. So deep as, baby. So deep as. I said I need your love. It went deeper than you and me.
