20251212 105624 And when melodies are gone, and you are hearing a song, I look to you. About to lose my breath, there's no more fighting left Sinking to rise no more Searching for that open door And every road that I've taken Leads to my regret And I don't know if I'm gonna make it. Nothing to do but lift my head. I'm up to you.
