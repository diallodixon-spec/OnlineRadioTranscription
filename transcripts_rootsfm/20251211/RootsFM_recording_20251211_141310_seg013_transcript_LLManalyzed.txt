Join me, Dr. Stephanie Mullis, and my featured guest as we discuss issues concerning chronic disease management, medication safety in the home, among other intriguing health related topics. Also, we have prayer for your healing. It's a program that takes you beyond the counters of the pharmacy and provides you useful information on pharmaceuticals, nutrition, as well as health practices which can improve your health and well-being. Beyond the Prescription is brought to you by Providence Pharmacy, 25 Olympic Way, Kingston 11, where service goes beyond the prescription.
