20251226 134827 My poor body's calling And needs attention fast Till you're here beside me, baby That's how long this pain's gonna last You gotta come back home, come back home You gotta come back, you gotta come back home Can't remember how long it's been I sure lost track of time Don't ask me how I'm doing I can't say I'm doing fine My world is doubts and derby Everything is upside down It's no use explaining But you come see what's going on You gotta come back home Mama Africa Mama Africa I'm coming home I'm coming home Hello Mama Africa How are you?
