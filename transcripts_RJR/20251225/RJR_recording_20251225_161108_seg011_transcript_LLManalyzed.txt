20251225 161108 If we have on this Christmas, you are gonna live it. Yeah. Everybody having fun, kids them just love Christmas. Watch them out and turkey jump. Full of a chicken, but not before before the night come down. Many ways to celebrate Christmas inna the garrison. Rain don't stop the holiday, sun string up and I'm old. Not to mention vaccine, here we all out and alcohol. Outer water from the waterworks, I leave the night cold. Rock-a-muffin Christmas.
