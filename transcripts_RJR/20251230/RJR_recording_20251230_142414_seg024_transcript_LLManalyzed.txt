20251230 142414 I'll be waking up in the morning probably hating myself And I be waking up feeling satisfied but guilty as hell but baby there you go again there you go again making me love you making me love you I'll stop using my head using my head let it all go let it all go got you stuck on my body on my body like a fool like a tattoo yeah and now I'm feeling stupid feelingin' back to you So hush my heart and I hope to die And I'll only stay with you one more night And I know I've said it a million times
