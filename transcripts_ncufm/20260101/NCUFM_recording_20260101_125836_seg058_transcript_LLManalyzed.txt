20260101 125836 Cruise and family or holiday voyage has come to a joyful close. Today was turnover Thursday and we laughed. We shared stories and we sailed through the season together. I just want to send a big salute to my second mate Abigail Bethune, the brilliant producer behind this show. And the new sports and current affairs crew who keep this ship steady on the daily. As your holiday cruise captain, Xavier Dick, I want to remind you, the holidays are about carrying joy. From the kitchen to the living room. From laughter to love. And yes, from one heart to another. So as we drop the anchor today, take that holiday spirit with you. May your seas be calm, your sails be bright and your celebrations full of cheer. That's coming from us all here on the steamship cruising. Happy holidays.
