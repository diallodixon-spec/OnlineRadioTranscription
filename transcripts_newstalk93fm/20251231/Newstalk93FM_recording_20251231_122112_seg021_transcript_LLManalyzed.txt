20251231 122112 I know you said not to call you again But I miss you And I hope I can see you one more day when I hope you're good, I hope you're well, I hope you live. I miss your touch, I miss your smell, I miss your lips. You can grab a drink, maybe grab some food, don't be ashamed. I know it's hard to know.
