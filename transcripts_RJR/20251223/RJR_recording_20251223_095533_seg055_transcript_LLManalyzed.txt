And I know that you have discretion as a police officer, but I would have expected him to say, you know, we're going to give you a warning this time, because apparently he's neither his friend or another police officer in that fun car. Well, the thing about it is that you have discretion, but you must exercise it fairly. You know, one of the things, you know, so I take all the time. I think one of the things that would hurt the human being to the core is a sense of injustice and lie. Thank you very much. Yes. It's funny. Tell a liar you go to your core. As you say, unjust act and affects you. It goes goes to your core It's in your being. Yes, that's why just this is so very important So I'm not saying what are you and I commend you didn't pretend to say what you did was correct But it's home it was dealt with and that is why it's so important
