20251217 171107 I've been patient and I've been waiting Call me stubborn, but I can't get over it You better come through this time Please hear my cry and if I ever let you down, my friend, it was a misunderstanding. So I thought you'd get forgotten. Don't I promise from today I'll go drunk like I never drunk, waved like I never waved, whined like I never wanted to, just to show you I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
