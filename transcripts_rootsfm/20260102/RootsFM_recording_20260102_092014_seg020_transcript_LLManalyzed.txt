20260102 092014 Why should I leave you? All of my lonely life I dream of you You're like a fairy tale, a wish come true So many times I tried to let you know I'm glad you're mine But still it's hard to see the burning flame inside of me Cause I love you Why should I leave you? If I love you, why should I leave you? Maybe I failed to make you understand How much you mean to me, you're part of every plan In every way you help me through
