20251218 174437 who haven't been here to understand that if you traverse some places, for example, the housing schemes in Luana and Newton, most of the roofs now are blue as a result of taparling. Yes, so it will be a long haul. It's not something that will happen overnight. This is a long road to recovery. So, for those who can reach out, especially in this Christmas season, to the persons on this side, it would be greatly appreciated. Very much appreciated. Thank you so much for talking to us, Superintendent. Superintendent Kimar Brooks is in charge of the St. Elizabeth Division of the Fire Brigade. Thank you again so much. Let's go to break. We're back right after.
