I've been traveling morning with such an amulet. Don't wait, it's noon and night. Get at the foil to put down my cradle alongside the road. Oh, I've got to hold it, yeah. I've got to open myself like a child. Open my face, I've got to put up a smile. I wake up in mine just to have more mine. Oh, God, I've got, I've got because I know that it's not an easy road And many see the glamour on the guitar So they think a better rose Me say, who feels it knows Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh Lord help with some steady blows Bad smoke, not an easy road
