20260101 114620 I'll see you, see you, in the morning, in the morning Wanna put my fingers through your hair, wrap me up in your legs, and I'll love you till your eyes roll back I'm tryna put you to bed, bed, bed, I'ma put you to bed Then I'ma rock your body, turn you over Love is what I'm your soldier,ing you like it's our first time I'ma put you to bed I'm staring at you while you sleep Irreplaceable beauty From my face up in your neck and breathe I'll take you into my senses Wake up, it's time to finish Round two, it round two. Matter of fact, it's closer to three. She like how long I've been sleeping. Shawty kisses turning to the sweetest. Might give it to me. And I can fit her to me. My angel, this is wonderful. Thanks for letting me bless you.
