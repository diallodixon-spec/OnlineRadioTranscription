============================================================

I'll make mistakes I'll never break your heart And I swear By the moon and the stars and the stars I'll be there I swear Like the shadow that's by your side I'll be there For better or worse, till death do us part I'll love you with every beat of my heart And I swear I gave you all the love I got I gave you more than I could give I gave you love
