20251230 211413 She likes you a lot. You're talking about, you're assuming I'm in that situation? No man, what I'm saying to you is, if you say it can come down the road, the woman who with you for benefits, you think she likes you a lot? When she with you for the benefits? Initially, probably no. So, you know it's possible for a woman, not like you, and eventually, and I get i get benefits and then down the road while these benefits going on she suddenly happened to is what she did take some money and go buy this lover shop no no i've seen situations where like a guy will look at girl and then start talk she's not really into him and she say no i give my chance can have money or whatever and then over time it would be that the benefits would stop and she would still be there so I'm assuming that because she's still there and the benefits have stopped she'd have some sort of ratings for him. Is what I meant at Brock? He just did fall on his face.
