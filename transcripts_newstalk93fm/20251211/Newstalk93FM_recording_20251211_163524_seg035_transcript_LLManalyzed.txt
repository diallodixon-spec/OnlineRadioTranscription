It's actually romantic, I really gotta hand it to you. Ooh, the man has ever loved me like you do. You think I'm tacky, baby. Stop talking dirty to me. It sounded nasty, but it feels like you're flirting with me. I mind my business. God's my witness that I don't provoke it. It's kind of making me sweat. Cause it's actually sweet, all the time you've spent on me. It's honestly lovely, all the effort.
