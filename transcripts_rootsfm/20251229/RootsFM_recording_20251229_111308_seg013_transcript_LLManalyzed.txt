We have vacations, we have late night activities, travel, can't even mention travel, social commitments, we skip meals. Are we eating too much? Yes. Some of us have late hours. I went to the store late to buy a pair of shoes and the attendant told me that she'll be waiting. Her hours there will be open until 11 o'clock, 10 o'clock the next day, then 11 o'clock. So late hours, for us as lecturers, we're marking. Increased stress, and we need to know that increased stress, and of course our sleep is disturbed.
