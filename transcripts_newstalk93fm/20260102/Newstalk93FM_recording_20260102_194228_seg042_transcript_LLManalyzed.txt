20260102 194228 I've been wandering all day I tried to be fine but I can't bear The noise in my mind wouldn't leave me I tried to get by but I'm burning And behind my mind it runs All these thoughts of troubling Fighting to give up my pain Fighting to be on my lane My mind running to the other I really need I need to free my mind now this is the piece that you cannot buy send me love that you cannot mix one
