20251217 192316 morning I want to pray a prayer of acknowledgement of sin a prayer of repentance of sin a prayer that say mighty God that we really truly have turned away from you and I ask that as we have recognized us in our hearts and I return to you with the clear in your word that my people, hallelujah, I call by my name, if they humble themselves and pray and turn from their wicked ways, yes, you will hear from heaven. You will forgive their sins and heed their land. Jamaica, turn to you and we cry out to you and we ask you for your mercy hallelujah may you hear may you heal may you deliver this nation and pray for the nation
