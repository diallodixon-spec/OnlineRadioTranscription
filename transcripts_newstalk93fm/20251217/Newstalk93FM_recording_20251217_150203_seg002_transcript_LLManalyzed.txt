20251217 150203 I tellin' you, I love whenever you bring a vine With your hands them up in the sky Watch me drunk and half in a time Cannibal time again And we have all money to spend And we go right down to the end Watch me with me cannibal friend Them, them me cannibal friend, beat, beat Things so sweet, sweet, sweet Feel up in the sky. Rolling back and having a time.
