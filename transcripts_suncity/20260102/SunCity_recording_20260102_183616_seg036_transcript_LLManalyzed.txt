20260102 183616 You can't count my grace I just say my lane, my lane Me no get the time for the hate and the bad energy Cause my mind don't my money Make you dance like broccoli Steady green like broccoli Steady on my grind don't hear what they want Telling me could be not my fantasy No one to check if might have been the wrong But be the rush, be the rush for a wedding be more Yeah. Everybody in the cross There's no door in the cross I see the roads I see the roads wherever they be moans I'm gonna make my time in the roads And climb on in the dogs In the roads In the roads Wherever they be moans There'll be hype, everybody in the cross
