Children carried white stones, polished smooth, each one a symbol of silence and peace. Elders walked with steady steps, remembering wars that had once divided them. Today, they came not to argue, but to listen. At the center of the river stood a wooden bridge. It had been built by hands from both sides. Those who once fought, those who once fared. The bridge was not grand, but it was strong. On Neutrality Day, the people crossed it slowly, one by one. No one asked who you were or where you came from. The baker walked beside the soldier.

And when they reached the middle of the bridge, each person placed their white stone.
