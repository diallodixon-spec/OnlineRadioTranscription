20251217 182212 No clear bomb like an American. Can't overstand like an Egyptian. I'm a glyphic when I shift it to the fifth dimension. And you feel them not a fit me religion. You get twist up and flat up like a Brazilian. File off your face with the mic in my hand. Then sip a cup of tea like I come from England. It's the city, the DJ make your body move. Things I dare to go through, so it feels like I'm in love with you.
