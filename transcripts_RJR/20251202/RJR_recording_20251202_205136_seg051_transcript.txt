I felt like I hit a reset button. That's what that's that's how I've been feeling. Wow. Yes. And you know, funny that for some reason when having talked to other persons who came, like my husband and my neighbour and so I kind of got that feeling. And that's kind of what I was looking forward to. And it delivered. totally delivered. I feel, I don't know, for some reason, I now can get up, like I have been for the last two days. I can go through the day without snacking and doing all kinds of crazy things that I was doing, like, you know, feeling like I need to eat every minute. I literally plan out my meals. I don't know. I have this, I have just reset so much. I get up, I have my tea, then about half an hour or an hour later I have my coconut water. I wonder where you got that kind of a strategy from. I don't have my breakfast and I'm not eating again until lunchtime.
