20251225 142626 I've been blue Telling this heart for me, for me It's been a blue holiday Cause I'm missing you I keep wishing I keep wishing Wondering if you think of me So I listen When the bells start ringing My heart starts singing I listen to the bells start to ring and my heart starts to sing I listen to the bells and they make me remember When we were those Christmas bells, but I never knew that I could miss you like this. Ready, baby? Uh-huh. Oh, come on.
