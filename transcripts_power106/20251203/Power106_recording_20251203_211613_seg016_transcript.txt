============================================================

You don't have to break down my door I'm all alone Come inside and you will see There's no one here but me Told you I'd soon be over Still you refuse to believe Are you satisfied? White blood tears from your eyes I'm all alone still you know I was telling a lie Are you satisfied? No one's with me tonight Only Jack and he's always by my side. Girl, you know I love you so. I can't hurt you. No, no, no, no. Want you to do what I say.
