Baby when I'm holding you I shake and I you all the lovin' we need Come on, let me take you down We'll go all the way to heaven Even if we need money more Come on, girl, let's show the show. I can live through all that loving with me. Broke the sun, red and violet to blue. I'm gonna rock this world for you. Hey, baby. If I fall, hold your way to heaven, you better shut down. Girl, I love you.
