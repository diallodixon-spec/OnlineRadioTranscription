We're talking about Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. And should you have a topic or know of a condition you're not so sure about and you want a show to be done on it, you can send that information to or you can call 876-580-5706 and you can just state what the condition that you want me to talk about or you want me to get a guest to speak about that. You can share that with that number 876-580-5706. So we spoke to family history being one of the factors that increase such the chances of developing irritable bowel disease. We also talked about diet, urban living, and hygiene. But there are other psychosocial factors that we must consider.
