I need her in my arms to hold But so warmer when she's gone Be by her side, so brave and bold Oh, I'll be in full-ight show Lightning flash and thunder roll Let's get close, no, it's not the Santa's show Just in case you've never been told You should know, girl, you're worth more than money and gold I need her in my arm, bitch, oh, if I want She be flowing on and on From dusk till dawn Oh, she's the one who keeps I come back to the sun so be a song to the rubble I need a bright light in my lullaby
