20260102 161309 and some traction here in Jamaica, you know, we're down on the ground now, so you know, once we're up on the ground, we can get the traction rolling on them things there. Online, it was already gone already, so we do a little visualizer for the song already, and you know, we get a whole heap of views on that song, them things there, so the song's been pushing out there and motivating people, but we here in Jamaica right now need to do the official video, you see what I'm saying? Because I've got a wicked concept for the video. I know people are going to like it. All right. Sounds good. Sounds good. So by when the people can expect a video? Before the year is done. You understand me? Because the script has been written already. And we are geared up for the world production and every single thing. We just have to wait for the rest to finish making the choir gone. So you can't understand what type of video we are going for. Yeah man, the tail is an open thing. So different. Blessings. Alright, love that. Alright, so we'll have the song queued up now. We're going to take a listen to the track. Play the song for all our listeners locked in.
