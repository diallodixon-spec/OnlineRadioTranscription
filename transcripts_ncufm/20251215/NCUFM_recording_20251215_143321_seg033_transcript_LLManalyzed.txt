Especially when doing the right thing means losing approval, losing comfort, losing an opportunity. Sometimes it can mean loss. But the book of Proverbs places urgency on guarding the heart above all things. Why? Yeah, that's the question. Why is that? It's because once the heart is compromised, everything else is going to follow. A guarded heart chooses truth over convenience. A guarded heart chooses obedience over popularity. It chooses faithfulness even when nobody applauds. Because integrity doesn't mean perfection. No, no, no, no. It just means you keep trying. It means consistency.
