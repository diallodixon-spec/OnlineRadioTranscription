Look straight ahead. There's nothing but blue skies. Look straight ahead. Nothing but blue skies. My eyes I can see clearly now the rain is gone I can see all the obstacles in my way Here is the rainbow I've been praying for. It's going to be a bright, bright, bright sunshine today. It's gonna be a bright, right, right sunshine today. Red, red, red, red. Bright, bright.
