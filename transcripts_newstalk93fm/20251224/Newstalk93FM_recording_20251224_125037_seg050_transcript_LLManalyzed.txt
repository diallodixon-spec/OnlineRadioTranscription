20251224 125037 5 in the morning i wake up to fight for my earnings fear in my mind is a warning pray to the one you're relying i've been wandering all day i try to be fine but i can't be the noise in my mind wouldn't leave me i try to get by but i'm burning i'm behind my mind it runs all these thoughts traveling in Fighting to give up my pain Fighting to be on my lane My mind, running to the other side When it's time to leave my life Then it tries to take me out I really need I need a free mind now
