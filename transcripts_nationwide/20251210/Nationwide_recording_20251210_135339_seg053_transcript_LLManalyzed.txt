Lauren say it cold out in New York City Say she coming home cause she must start to play If you hear she ballin' I need a little runaway Lauren coming home for Canna balla Need a little runaway This woman does but she party bagga Need a little run away She tell us she friend and family I need a little runway If If you see the rhythm, see where she go Watch she whine and rollin' Every video datting, she fold Is she whining and rollin'? All over the road Watch she whinin' and rollin' When the rhythm hitting, she soul Watch she whin' she soul, what she want, I'm rollin' Nationwide, 90 is best
