20251231 095851 Kareem Boyetting's weathers in the YouTube chat asking if you can call about the Reggae Boys Kareem went on to say I might have to call out from work he's saying he's depressed he needs a mental health day let me remind you Kareem that the Ministry of Health has a mental health helpline and if you are in need of assistance in that regard please do reach out to the ministry's mental health helpline so that you can get some assistance there. Not sure what we can do here on the consumer hour for you fighting those issues after the reggae boys match but you know my prayers are with you and I pray that you will be well enough to make it to work today Kareem but you do take care there is also a wellness bench I am not sure where all of them are but I do know that there is one on the premises
