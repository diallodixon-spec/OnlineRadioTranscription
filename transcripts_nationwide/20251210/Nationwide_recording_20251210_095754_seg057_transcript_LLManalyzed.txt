They go on a speed test and they see the type of service that they're getting. They say they don't use speed tests. They say, oh you know when the person is getting a bad service, other than when you're talking on a whatsapp call, the call drops every minute. They send you a picture, the picture is not sent to you. Oh, oh, oh, you know, they don't use that technique. They say, no, that's the only technique we have to use to know that we're not getting any service. And your internet service is the same way. Your data connection is horrible.

But when I go in like in Aperture or downtown, the service is poorer. But I don't know.
