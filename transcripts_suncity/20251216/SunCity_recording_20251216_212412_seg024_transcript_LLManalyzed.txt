20251216 212412 I'm saving my love, need you here, let me get you I see what you want, what you need, won't play with you You wanna throw it all away for me You got me doing wow-wow dance for you I'm savin' my love Need you here Let me get you My pretty baby, you flawless Let me find out you the coldest You actin' up, won't you slide in, come show me A lot of girls, you're the only one I wanted Is it wrong that I wanna kiss a bad goodnight? If I like what I see, I'ma double back two times When I get to you, I always throw it back like it's all home. Yeah, it's true to go shoot. I ain't playing about you. So girl, ain't nobody gonna try you. Don't play with you, they're not your shoes. If you had a twin, I would choose you. Right hand on the bottle, girl, it's true. I hang up my jersey for you.
