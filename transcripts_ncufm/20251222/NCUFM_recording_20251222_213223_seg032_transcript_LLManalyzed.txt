My relatives have failed and my close friends have forgotten me. The sojourners in my house and my slave women count me as a stranger. I have become a foreigner in their eyes. I call to my servant, but he does not answer. I must personally plead with him. My breath is repulsive to my wife, and I am loathsome to my own family. Little boys also despise me.

My bones cling to my skin and to my flesh, and I have escaped by the skin of my teeth. Pity me, you my friends.
