20251216 203623 people, if only for this week, we are going to put him alongside Nanny, Sam Sharp and all the rest of them. He is a modern day hero. For those who don't know, Mr. Barnswell rescued a little girl who had been kidnapped from her school by a man who is thankfully now in police custody. So the 6 year old girl was abducted from the St. Thomas Moor Preparatory School last a while later and thanks be to God Mr Barnswell and his wife were driving somewhere when they happened to see a man walking with the little girl. He drove down on him and questioned him and when the man couldn't give no good answer Mr Barnswell got out of his car and went to confront the man. Now don't take that part lightly, no people, because he'll never know if the man will have a weapon or something like that for harming him, you know. He'll come out and he'll hold the brother and he'll take the little girl from him. Then he kept the man there until the police came. That is it. I am just glad that Mr. Bargewell was there and decided to act, even in the face of uncertain circumstances.
