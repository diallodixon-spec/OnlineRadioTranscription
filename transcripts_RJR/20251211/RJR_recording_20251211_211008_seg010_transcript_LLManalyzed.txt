2025-12-11 22:39:09 Christmas is coming back soon Tell me what is Christmas without you Fa la la la the snow is falling Fa la la la don't keep me waiting Baby I'm still counting down the days I can't wait to see your face To make every winter dream come true. My only December wish is that your kiss is coming back soon. Tell me, what is Christmas without you?
