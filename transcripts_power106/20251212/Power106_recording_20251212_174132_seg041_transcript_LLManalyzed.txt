20251212 174132 I don't got a thing on you And they can go just like you do And I want the whole wide world to see But you are beautiful to me I love my chocolate skin You are royal, you are queen Don't you change that, the beauty within Lift your head up, and lift it with pride And you don't have to worry, I'm always here by your side You must have got me, got me in a trap Cause every time I keep coming back Cause they don't got a thing on you And they can't close your eyes
