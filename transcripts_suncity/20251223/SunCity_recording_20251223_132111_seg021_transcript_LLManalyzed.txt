20251223 132111 I don't want a body and I don't want no wine. Shhh, shhh, shhh. Stop it nice. Bloody bangs girl tonight, tell you I drive. When the moon will be able to shine a plane. Get up and fight, baby girl, all the night. My girl, get me up, I'm a-knowing on you. What's up, I'm about to tell me I'm falling, yeah. I ain't got no money, but I even know I'm in love. Guess what, you know me, tell me, with that Agra T, like Kung Fu. Agra T, she's a fool, but she can't move with me. Love, love, only a rapper she.
