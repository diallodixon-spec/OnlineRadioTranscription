Look at me now, look at me now Look at me now and I'll tell you my life Where they used to come on me Go on, no one used to come on Me, my life was so lonely Look at me now, look at me now Look at me now, where dem treat me less than gold, put me in a box like a rectangle. Oh, oh, look at me now, oh look at me now. Look at me now. And me a tell you my life, where dem used to go round me, go round me. No one used to come round me, my life.
