20251230 192018 It's so awesome. Tell me some of the places you've hiked to. Well, I have hiked the Mont Blanc, which is the Mastiff region, the mountain region that borders Italy, France, and Switzerland. And just last year, I went to a region in Austria and Germany. Of course, I can't pronounce the name of that area. But it was a pretty good experience. And I do a lot of hiking in the UK in terms of the Lake District. And even here, I do a lots of hiking. But of course, some areas, it's less strenuous because the terrain is flat, others you know is like you set yourself you know will you make it over that mountain but then while you're there suffering and walking and pushing yourself in a day and you're seeing like elderly couples who are just motoring past you
