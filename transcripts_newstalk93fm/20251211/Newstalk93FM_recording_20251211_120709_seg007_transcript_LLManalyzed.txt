I barely could concentrate I feel a sugar rush in my vein One cup it does make my day I'm missing it, we're not gonna love her, yeah Heat me up Only you alone can bring fire back in the soul Heat me up Girl, you are the thing I could never leave you alone, no And no matter what they go say, I'm holding you close. I could never let you go. Miss Houshiné. Girl, I'm coming home and I'll see you again. All day, through the night, I'm dreaming. Miss Houssiné.
