20251219 100504 90 FM app on your mobile phone. Now here's your host Tyrone Reid. for the calendar year 2025. What a year it has been and we are thankful to the Most High that he has seen us through. 2025 had its rough patches, particularly with the passage of Hurricane Melissa, but we give God thanks that we are here almost at the close of this calendar year. Lots to be thankful for, lots to reflect on. Yeah, but we have some heavy lifting to do, but before we get to the heavy lifting, good morning to you for joining us on the 90 FM band 90.3.
