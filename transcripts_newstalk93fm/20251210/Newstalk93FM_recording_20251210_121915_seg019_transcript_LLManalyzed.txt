I feel like I run in tongue again Jump and shake the ground again We with one and one and them No place like home Now is the time for way To charm on somebody Hand up in the air Madness everywhere It isn't with DNA So jump up, play a mass, wind up in the van Free up, live your life, and do whatever you like Mashing up in with DNA Winding up in with DNA
