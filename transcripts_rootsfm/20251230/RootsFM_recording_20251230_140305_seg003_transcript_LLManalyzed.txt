20251230 140305 So don't stop before then, it's destiny calling A power I just can't deny It's never changing, can't you hear me I'm saying I want you for the rest of my life Together forever and ever to pass Together forever we two And don't you know I would move heaven and earth To be together forever with you If they ever get you down There's always something I can do Because I wouldn't ever want to see you frown I'll always do what's best for you There ain't no mistakin' It's true that we're makin' Something to last for all time It's never changin' Can you hear me? I'm sayin'
