20251226 110806 Man, your life must be so happy Now on the other hand I'm here trying to live a life, just get a wife Having a family would be so nice, it would bring joy to me To find a lady who would bring a baby boy for me or a girl for me Would mean the world, lucky you You've got a woman to go home to I've got to find me myself a woman What I wouldn't do man Lucky you, you've got some kids to attend to I've got to me myself a woman, what I wouldn't do now When you reach home, you're greeted with hugs and kisses By your wife and your three lovely kids Just to see your dinner on the table Ain't got nothing to worry about, you got your cable Still got a young one coming up in the cradle Damn, man, your life must be so stale as for me
