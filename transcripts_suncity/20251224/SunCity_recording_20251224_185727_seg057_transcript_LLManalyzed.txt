20251224 185727 Andrea says the coldest place she's ever went in Jamaica is a place called Newcastle. Where's that located? Closest place I've ever been to. The coldest place I have ever been to in Jamaica. It's a place in St. Anne called Alexandria, close to 9 miles where Bob Marley is from. It's not cold, it's cold. I don't know how snow falls at that place, trust me. The coldest place in Jamaica, I swear. Alexandra, Cave Valley, St. Baker, Bethany, them places, no sir. St. Baker, Bethany, them place them. No, sir. Me no know people live at them the place, I swear.
