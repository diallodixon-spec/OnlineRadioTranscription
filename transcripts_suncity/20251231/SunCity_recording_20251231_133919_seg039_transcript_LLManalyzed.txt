Everybody in the world Everybody need food Watch for fire Guess who's coming For dinner? If you can't don't you Dread your plan for sure You know nothing but pain You never walk through the flame Oh no You never fend for yourself That's a shame Well, I never wanted a silver spoon in grave with my name. Oh, no. Watch the lion in the zoo. In the team, man hungry. Hungry soon turn to anger. When anger turn to danger. Ain't me no one nobody come and tell me about me temper. Hot colder than December. And yes, me do remember. Those hopeless nights alone without no suffer so. Guess who's coming for dinner? Better have my food, man. Better have my food. Guess who's come in for dinner? Oh, better have my food. Make sure I make it through the night. Oh, mama, don't cry.
