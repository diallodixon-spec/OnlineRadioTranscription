20251223 190103 doing well. Happy Christmas to you. Happy Christmas. Merry Christmas and I hope it's going well so far. So far so good. Yeah. Alright. So, I'm glad to hear that sorrel counts as a natural remedy cuz I like it. Love it actually. So, why is it considered natural remedy? And that's the thing. That's the thing. Once it's one of our plants that grows on the island, we often again find that we have a lot of medicinal properties and because it's short, we want to make sure if we get our hands on a little bit of it that we're making our sorrel drink. There's so many other uses, especially if you buy the entire plant bundles where you get different parts of the plant. So we'll be looking at what are the different parts of the sorrel and what are the medicinal properties for these different parts. So how do you prepare sorrel? Do you prepare your own sorrel or are you just waiting?
