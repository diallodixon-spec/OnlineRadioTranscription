20251225 092618 I don't want a lot for Christmas There is just one thing I need Don't care about the present Underneath the Christmas tree I don't need to end my stocking Live upon the fireplace Santa Claus won't make me happy With a toy on a Christmas day Oh Oh, I won't ask for much this Christmas. I won't even wish for snow. And I'm just gonna keep on waiting for me in the mistletoe.
