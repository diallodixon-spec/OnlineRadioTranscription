20251212 205031 Oh, I just don't know what's happening every day. Sunday, I pray. I'm on my journey, who is gonna stop me? I see no one in my way. It's even more than words can say. Unless the last year is away. If it takes more than birds to sing, to let them know he's the only king of kings. Try that blessing, if you're ever for us the last year.
