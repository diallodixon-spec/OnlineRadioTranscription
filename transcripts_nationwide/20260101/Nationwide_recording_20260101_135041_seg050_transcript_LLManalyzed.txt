20260101 135041 I can't find no peace inside I wish you were here, holding me tight If I had you near, you'd make it all right I wish you are here, cause I feel like a child tonight There's rain on my window And I can't count the drops But I can't help feeling lonely There's no way, no way that I could stop I wish you were here
