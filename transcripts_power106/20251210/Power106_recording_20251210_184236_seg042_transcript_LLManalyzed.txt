We have Fit Like A Fighter from Portmore. We have Suga, Olympic, Garden and Gym. So we have a good representation, I'll say, of boxing all over the island. And although we do not have J.F. in this side, we have to salute them because they are always so supportive and right now they're focused in rebuilding Jamaica. Very interesting indeed. Thank you very much for that. Very Jones, the impact on the hurricane, you have to go to a break in a couple of minutes, but talk about the impact of the hurricane. What has that done? Has it dampened the enthusiasm at all? What's happening? It's actually the impact of the hurricane. Yes. You would think that it would have dampened the enthusiasm for probably after the first week.
