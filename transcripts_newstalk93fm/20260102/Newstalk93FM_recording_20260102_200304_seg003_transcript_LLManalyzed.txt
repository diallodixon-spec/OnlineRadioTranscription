20260102 200304 I love the way that you bring a vibe We chance them up in the sky Rollin' back and havin' a time And we have well money to spend And we jammin' down to the end See me with me cannibal friend my friend until he beats up again. I wish he'd come from me. Sandu, I wish he'd gone from me. Karanaj, I wish he come from me. And she loves she back and on. I wish she'd come from me, Arima, I wish she'd gone from me, and Malaba, I wish she come from me. Because she loves she back anon.
