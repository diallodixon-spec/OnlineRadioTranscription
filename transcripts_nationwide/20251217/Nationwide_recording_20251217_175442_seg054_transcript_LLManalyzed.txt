20251217 175442 The fines, everybody was talking about the fines, not talking about changing their driving habits or trying to abide by the law. They were saying that the system is unfair and it's too draconian. But if you abide by the law, you will have nothing to worry about, right? And I think that it is high time that we enforce. My good friend, Mr McKenzie is there. Because I've seen on the road where persons do some reckless and careless driving and sometimes they have service vehicles in the line and they don't even go out to try to run them down to challenge their behavior. There are a lot of persons on the street who include PPV operators who are out there. They have no regard for it now. And if the law doesn't hold people to grips or bring them to books, we're going to have a society that individuals feel like they can do whatever they want to do.
