You could come and look for me If you want a jam well then call me I'll fill up all yours baby So let me ease off the tension Say she love just how I just hold it Them gyal they whining down But it's you alone we control it Yes she a professional bam bam ruler She say bring it come come and wipe me down't let nothing get in between us Well I get you in a feeling Right up on your bumper baby I know where you're from this lady I love how you dip and go long way I know you're not easy Long time I've been waiting for you
