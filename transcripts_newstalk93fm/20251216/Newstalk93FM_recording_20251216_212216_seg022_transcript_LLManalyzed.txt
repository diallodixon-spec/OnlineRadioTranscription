All eyes on you, all eyes on you. In the middle of dance, say when you kick off your shoes, you make it wiggle and bounce. Say she want a rude boy with a rude white wine. Don't want no man there with no schoolboy wine. No mannequin, no romancing. She walk home from night till the morning. She fling it up, she fling it back, I ride it, I go handle that She keep it up, she look back, and I ride it Die when she lies, die when she lies, she wants some action in her life
