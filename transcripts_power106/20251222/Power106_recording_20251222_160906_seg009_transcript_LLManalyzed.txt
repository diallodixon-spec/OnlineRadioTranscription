20251222 160906 on my phone I can't go on it and read so I suppose they just data no connectivity no internet connectivity so I don't understand how come we are allowed to buy the 28 day plan or the seven week plan but we don't get no connectivity at all this is from way back after the hurricane and which area are you right now because i'm sending this through to flow say um junctions area oh oh oh that may be a problem area right now um understood yeah man that that side of the island man i tell you i, I- I- I- But whenever there's no damage, when the hurricane comes... Your people of Junction never got any damage from Melissa? Wait, wait now. Let me go slow. What I'm saying is sir, there was no major breakdown or catastrophe. Okay.
