20251226 172518 Said I had a close one yesterday Jabut an angel over me, be strong And I say, with a firm meditation One day things must get better Don't you go down, keep your head above that water One day things must better, be strong And aval with a firm meditation. One day things must get better. Don't you go down, keep your head above the water, say. One day, things must get better, the rich is wise and is unconceived, but the poor with over-standings surge at the mouth. One man more, the rich rate is increased. I said be not grieved, riches are not for ever. Heed me not to your praise, I choose none of these ways. Be not wise in thine own eyes. Holy child you must praise, shine not with the one with you.
