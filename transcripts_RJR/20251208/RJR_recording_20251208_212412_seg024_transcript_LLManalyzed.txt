I'm gonna buy the wedding ring All the church bells gonna ring And baby you just wait and see We're gonna be united United We've got to make it we're gonna leave. I'm gonna buy her wedding ring. And all the church bells are ringing. And maybe you'll just wait and see. We're gonna be human too. We've got to be and we're gonna be. We're gonna be a human too.
