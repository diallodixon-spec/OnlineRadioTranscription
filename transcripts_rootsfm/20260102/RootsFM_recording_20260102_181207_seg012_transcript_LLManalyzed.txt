20260102 181207 This is what my baby said to me, Lord. Oh, didn't it? Oh. She say she want a good life. No one to cause her pain and strife. She want a good life, no man to cause her pain or strife. She don't want no unsteady relationship. One with a rock like a rockin' ship Wanna love that steady as can be One that brings back memory She want a good life No man to cause her pain and strife She say she want a good life, no man to cause her Pain and strife She's been in and out of love pain And she says she must confess She's been used and abused But there's no more time to lose Oh no, because she won a good life
