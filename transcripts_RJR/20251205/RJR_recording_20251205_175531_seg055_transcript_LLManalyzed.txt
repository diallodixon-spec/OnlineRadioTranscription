Henry with us now. Sir Henry, I appreciate you talking to us. Thank you so much. Good evening, Diane. How are you doing? I'm doing well, thanks. Not so sure about our forest though. The estimates I saw were that about 50% of our forests have been damaged by, by Mellisa. So are we talking about, you know, some leaves gone, some branches brought down or where the damage, 25% of the total that is damaged, that is, where the damage is severe, another 25% where it is moderate to zero, and the other 50% is not nearly as severe as we had first cleared.
