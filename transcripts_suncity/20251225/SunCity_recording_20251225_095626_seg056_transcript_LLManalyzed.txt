20251225 095626 I love you, boy But I just can't let you go Did you ever wish you could get back something that you did in your past? If it wasn't for me, I know what we had. It's definitely gonna last there. That we say something we don't mean when we're mad. But I realize that I've been foolish. I never should have turned my back. Cause it's a cold world when you're out there all alone. So many times, cause I wanted to just pick up the phone. And tell you, ooh, baby, baby, I miss you lovin' so I ain't holdin' back no more Your girl is comin' home And I want you to love me Like I'll never let you go
