20251222 113632 God, morning. Morning. Morning. Morning, what's up? I love the man's vibes and energy still. But, friend boss, you hear me now? You hear that? All right. I said last week, you see, somebody kind of burned me out on another radio station and called me traitor just because I said to a friend, Muta Baruka, I said, Madura kind of, when he's under fire, you know, he could have eased out of the presidential seat a little and eased America for the people. They don't want it. And they say, you know, they're troubling the man for nothing at all. So I say, well, if the man in the hot seat, what's the best way? Am I wrong for saying so, bossy? Is there something wrong I'm telling them to do? No, but that is your fault.
