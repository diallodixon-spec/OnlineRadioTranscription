20251231 192019 and your wonder was seen through it all, how you kept your people and sustain your people even through those difficult moments. Even now, we recognize that you're still with us. We recognize that your presence has never left us. We're still comforted day after day by the many testimonies of your graciousness towards your people even after the passage of Hurricane Melissa. And so Father, as we look back over 2025, we look back with joy and gratitude and thanksgiving. We bow before you constantly and we lean on you constantly we look to you our hope is in you because without you we can't do it We can't go day after day without you. We can't make it day out today without you. I pray you mighty God
