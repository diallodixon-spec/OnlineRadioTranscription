20251225 132117 Just the clock above my head ticking in time. But your bright eyes lights up the room all right. You're my holiday. You're my star tonight. Sorry, Santa, I don't want to waste your time. Give someone else a present. I've got mine. Got everything I need right here with me. Merry Christmas, everyone, wherever you may be. I don't need a stackin' or a fireplace. Cause I have you to put a smile on my face. We have each other like a family.
