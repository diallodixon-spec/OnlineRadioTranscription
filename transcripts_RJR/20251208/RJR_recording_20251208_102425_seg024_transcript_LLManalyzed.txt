It is something that is almost a kind of gut feeling. And that's not good enough. You can't have someone who's employed and the person who's assessing is a gut feeling as to your output. I think you could do better. On what basis? What is the matrix? What is it that you're assessing it on? And is that fear under the circumstances? And far too often, when we speak about performance evaluation, we see it as one dimensional as to what it is that you are expected to do full stop and whether or not you are doing that well. When in fact some of the things that you are being assessed on might be unfair, I mean it will be suited for the role that you are asking to perform. So it requires a very scientific approach, I would think, in terms of putting these things together.
