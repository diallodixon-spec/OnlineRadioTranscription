20251218 124720 Just to stay in your good grave. Lately I've been thinking maybe you're not ready for me. Maybe you think I need to learn maturity They say watch what you ask for Cause you might receive But if you ask me tomorrow I'll say the same. I am ready for love. Would you please lend me your ear? I promise I will.
