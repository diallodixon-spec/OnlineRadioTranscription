What are you moving forward with? What are you leaving behind? Drive Time Family, day one, 2026, is in the history books. Already some families are are hurting already some families are being added to whichever season your family finds itself in I hope at least you are wrapped up and tied up with Jesus we continue our look tomorrow 2 o'clock we continue with the drive and I want you to be here overnight I'll be reserving your seat one else can sit in that seat. But that means if you don't come to the show tomorrow, your seat is going to be empty and your absence is going to be felt. The drive time family is going to be missing you.
