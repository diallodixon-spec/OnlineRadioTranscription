20260102 115325 From right here, if you get lonely, give me some good love to listen through your eyes. Listen to my voice, it's my disguise. On a Friday! Gotta watch my back and keep my scrap, but nonetheless, I think about you when I'm gone, wishin' I can hold you. Probably home, wishin' someone come and love ya how they postin' up. It's too late, it's too late. I hold chasin' my dreams, don't get in the way. I blame my struggles and my offers for my hustle and waste. I'm waitin' in Michigan.
