If you say to us, hey, thanks so much, but I actually want to gift this to someone else, just give us the details and we'll help to facilitate that. Right. Because a lot of the people in, how is your coverage in say Western Jamaica? Has all of that been restored just yet? Not fully restored, but I'm really happy to share that we are over 85% of mobile sites online now. Our teams are working 24x7. So sometimes guys, you're going to see them out on the streets in the rain, in the sun, in the night and in the day. It's literally what we are obsessed with and focused on right now, just reconnecting Jamaica. Right. Which is why the gifting is so important because I'm thinking that my people in Western Jamaica won't be able to win directly, but whoever wins can actually donate what they've won to them. Well, they will.
