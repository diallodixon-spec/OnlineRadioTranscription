20251218 165727 Do you ever cry yourself to sleep In the middle of the night when you awake? Are you calling out for me? Do you ever reminisce? I can't believe I'm acting like this Know it's crazy How I still can feel your kiss It's been six months, eight days, 12 hours since you broke away I miss you so much and I don't know what to say I should be over you I should know better but it's just not the case It's a cave in the heart.
