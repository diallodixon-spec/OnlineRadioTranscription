I won't make a list and send it to the North Pole for sending I won't even stay awake to hear those magic rain tears clear I just want you here tonight Holding on to me so tight What more can I do? All I want for Christmas is you You, baby All the lights are shining so brightly everywhere. And the song of children's laughter fills the air. And everyone is singing. I hear those children singing. Santa, won't you bring me water?
