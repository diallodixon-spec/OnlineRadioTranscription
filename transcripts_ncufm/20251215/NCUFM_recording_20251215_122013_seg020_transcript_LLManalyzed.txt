20251215 122013 Did He say He'll never forsake you? How many of you believe it? Let me hear you in here. He won't let you down, right? He'll catch every tear. So if you know Him to be your Father and He cares for you, come on and stand on your feet and help me praise him in heaven. Come on, come on. Sing! Oh, come on and worship with me. Sing! So whatever. Come on., I promise you, I'll spend my whole life with you. Jesus, my whole life has changed.
