So glad I met you, now I've got it wrong. It's just you and me, love. We'll stay together through the break of day. Kissing and caressing, kissing and caressing me. Feel that passion, love is on the way, yeah. Well, let me hear you say oh, oh Baby say oh, oh, let me hear you say, oh, oh Tell me, sugar, it feels so good Let me, please say oh, oh baby say oh, oh Let me hear say oh say oh Tell me honey it feels so good But it would be the fall over me Touched by your spirit of loving
