20251224 105021 So much to be grateful for. Father, I do miss my son. Oh, father, I love you, and we will stand and sing. Oh, Yahweh, I need you each and every day. Oh, Father I love you and we'll stand and sing. And you give us all justice as we forgive those who trespass against us. Look into my life and seeing what God has done. He caught my blessing one by one. Oh, God, you've been good to me. You've put me to my end.
