20260101 123215 I wish I could carry your smile in my heart For times when my life seems so low It would make me believe what tomorrow could bring When today doesn't really know, doesn't really know I'm all out of love, I'm so lost without you I know you were right, believing for so long I'm out of love, what am I without you? I can't be too late To say that I was so wrong I want you to come back And carry me home Away from these lies
