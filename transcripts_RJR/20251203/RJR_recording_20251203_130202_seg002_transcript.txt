15,000 people with disabilities are registered with the Council across St. Elizabeth, Westmoreland, Trelawny, St. James, and Taneval. Executive Director of JCPD, Dr. Christine Hendricks, says persons with disabilities in shelters are struggling to cope. Now, the Minister of Finance has rolled out the new Student Loan Bureau SLB debt reset program. It follows an election pledge made by the Jamaica Labour Party in August when the party announced that students with SLB loans in good standing would receive a one-off grant of $100,000. At this morning's post-cabinet press briefing on Hurricane Melissa recovery efforts, Finance Minister Fayval Williams said despite the disruption caused by the storm, the government has honored its commitment. Minister Williams, who is also MP for St. Andrew Eastern, said many students seeking help for tertiary studies will still be hesitant to approach the Student Loan Bureau because of their fear or misinformation about the application process. Those are the local headlines. Business headlines are next at 2 o'clock.
