Hey little sisters, this is the day. This is the dayon, AKA Soul Child Denise, and you are listening to Sun City Radio, Radio with a Difference, rebuilding Jamaica. The beat of the drum, the strumming of the bass guitar, the unison of the keyboard, the steadiness of the rhythm guitar, energy from the percussion and the voice cementing the sound. This is reggae music.
