20251226 155632 I hope the snow falls, very soft and light And I hope the fire keeps you warm tonight I hope you the best And I pray that all your dreams come true. I wish you love and happiness each day as you pursue. I pray that God will add his blessings to whatever you may do. But most of all, Merry Christmas to you.
