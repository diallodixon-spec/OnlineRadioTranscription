20251218 132620 give all you can for recovery? Yes, because I think that's the chemistry with WUS and Baruch. We have a desire and a passion for our farmers to help our farmers. As such, when I saw the opportunity came up, I went out, maximized on everything that I could to ensure that this project can reach as much possible farmers as possible and ensure that the necessary and the basic item is there for them to get back on their feet so that they can care for their families. You're doing a great job. How can arm farmers reach out to you at Baru? Well, we have our sales rep that are across the island. We are located in Bogwalk, St. Catherine. And you can reach me, of course. My number is 531-9635. Beautiful. Thank you so much, Vanessa. Final word to Nelson English Johnson. Sure. It would be remiss of me because we are here because of the excellent partnership that we have in St. Elizabeth with the Jamaica Agricultural Society as well as the Jamaica Forage Clubs. They are the ones who would have supported us in selecting the farmers, mobilizing them.
