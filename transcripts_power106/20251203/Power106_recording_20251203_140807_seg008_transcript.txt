Let's not quarrel. Let's not fight. Let's get together. We all can unite unite Then take off these chains From our power fields Cause we're gonna walk, we're gonna walk Walk, walk, walk On freedom's streets Everybody knows we're gonna walk We're gonna gonna walk Walk, walk, walk down freedom street Let me tell you people, united we stand Divided we fall Respect your brothers
