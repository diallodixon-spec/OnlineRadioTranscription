20251223 122620 There is just one thing I need Don't care about the presents I only need the Christmas tree I don't need to end my stocking Live upon the fireplace Santa Claus won't make me happy With a toy on a Christmas day I just want you for my own More than you could ever know Oh I won't ask for much this Christmas I won't even wish for snow I'm just gonna keep on waiting Underneath the mistletoe I won't make a list and send it To the North Pole for singing
