20251231 175836 the status will be discontinued and we are very very concerned as to what's going to take place there and we're talking about what over 250 000 persons this is the status they've had since the earthquake yes yes yes the same thing goes for venezuelans and and and and several other nations who have tps because the the present administration is discontinuing TPS, Temporary Protective Status. I suppose at least some of the people perhaps in the interim had become citizens, perhaps? Yes, I'd gone on that and adjusted their status. But a lot of them didn't. A lot of them weren't, because some would not have had the opportunity to do so based on how they came into the country because if they came in the country with our status you know they would be a challenge there. I'm going to have to leave it there I'm out of time but if some will continue to follow we always appreciate you updating us Irwin and Happy New Year to you.
