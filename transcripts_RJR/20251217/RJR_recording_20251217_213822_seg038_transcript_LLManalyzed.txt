20251217 213822 Let's go for a sleigh ride, a wonderful sleigh ride Come hurry along with a song in the wintry world to ride Just see those sleigh bells jingling, ringing, jingling too The morning's lovely, we're the forest sleigh ride together with you I'm sure Our cheeks are nice and rosy and comfy, cosy are we We'll snowboard up together like two birds of a feather would be Let's take them holding hands and sing a chorus or two Come on, it's lovely when the horses lay right together
