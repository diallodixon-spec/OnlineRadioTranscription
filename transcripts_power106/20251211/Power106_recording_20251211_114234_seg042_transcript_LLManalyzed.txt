You alluded to it earlier that even some of your guests, tourists, were involved in this effort. Based on what I'm seeing, are the homes being assembled on the grounds of the hotel and then transported to those who need them? That is correct. That is correct. The moment that our guests caught wind of what we were doing, they were so eager to help. And they came out in droves, you know, asking, you know, show us how to put this nail in, you know, allow us to use the drill. And we got the support of our guests. And these by and large American tourists? Yes, they're from America. We had a group from Brazil. There were couples from Australia with their family. So these are vacationing tourists who decided to keep their reservations and visits as their way to give back to tourism.
