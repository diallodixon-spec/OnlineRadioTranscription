That style where you give me the top header Roll your bumper, girl push it further Bubble up, sit down and drive like a learner You do the thing so me never get hurt One time, girl bubble down there Two time, girl bubble right there For the last time, girl, we are doing it over and over We call that a slow wine Just keep it, just keep it, just Keep it Right now it is my time It is my time, girl Don't tell me to try and hide All I want is waistline Right now it is waistline Waistline, waistline, waistline
