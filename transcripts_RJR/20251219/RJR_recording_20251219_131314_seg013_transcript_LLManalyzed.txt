20251219 131314 Since you've been gone, I've been hanging around here lately Got my mind missing Jumped in my car, tried to clear my mind Didn't't help me. I guess I'm all messed up now, baby. As soon as I jumped into my run, those memories start to play. I saw the note on the radio, and there you are, baby, once again It's just another sad love song Wrecking my brain like Haiti I'm all torn up and beat fast
