20251219 171613 brought against it by People's National Party councillors Michael Troup and Sylvan Reid. In December 2019, the Supreme Court ruled in favour of the politicians who had sued TVJ, CVM Television, the Attorney General, Police Commissioner Owen Ellington, Senior Superintendent ofters' appeal, and setting aside key parts of the earlier judgment. In its decision, the Court ruled that TBJ and CVM should not have been held liable for defamation in relation to news broadcasts that were the subject of the lawsuit. The judges found that the trial judge erred in rejecting the broadcasters' defence of responsible journalism known as Reynolds privilege.
