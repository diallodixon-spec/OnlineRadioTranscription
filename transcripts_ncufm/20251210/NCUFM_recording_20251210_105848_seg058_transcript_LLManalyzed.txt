That's what I call love But that's not how that story ends Every day, every day, people forget That's love, that's love That's the kind of love that a brother gives That's the love they beat us and they carry across your dreams That's the peace they made us set and they hung there and died That's the love I'd face you for your life That's the love That's the love Good Love Good Love Good Love
