20251217 165849 I want to thank our producer, Daniel Lee, also Big Up Akeem for connecting us on social media and the left, so did he. And thank you, Emily, for giving us a wonderful, spirited start to the show this afternoon. Enough water and I was back to myself. Yes, yes. I got to thank, I see a package here from JPS with my name on it. What did you say, Johnny? Thanks to the team from JPS for sending. I think there's one with your name on it too. Shawnee, you're powered. I don't know, if I'm powered, I don't know. I'm going to see if I'm empowered. Thank you, JPS. We're out of here, guys. Have a great evening. you
