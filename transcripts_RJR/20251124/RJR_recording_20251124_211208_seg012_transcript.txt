============================================================

We could come back to my place Where the lights are now low My more love is a gamble Got my eyes open wide Spin my heart like a wheel I feel all good tonight Oscar, Oscar Does she have a fit for me? Does she? Does she? I just want to know. Cause that girl thing you got there. I don't know someone like that. Does she? Oh, does she? I got a little money in my pocket And I want a hundred dishes for you girl Is that worth that for me?
