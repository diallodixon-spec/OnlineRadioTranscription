Let us just clear commercials and come back. You're listening to Power 106 FM. The time is now 3.45. We all felt the forceful winds and rains, but for some, they brought unimaginable loss. Homes destroyed, lives disrupted, and communities cut off from each other. For decades, the RGR Gliener Communications Group has answered the call in times of crisis. Through the RG Cares Foundation, that spirit of compassion continues. We invite you to stand with us and support our brothers and sisters in need. Please donate bottled water, canned foods, other non-perishable, and personal hygiene products. Items can be dropped off at our partner churches, Webster United, Hope United, Meadowbrook United, and Portmore United, between 9 a.m. and 3 p.m., Mondays through Saturdays, and at the Anglican Church of the Good Shepherd,
