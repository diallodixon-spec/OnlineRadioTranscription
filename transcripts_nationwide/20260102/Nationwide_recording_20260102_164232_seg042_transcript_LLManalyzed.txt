But as you know Fashion Nova and she like once a dress like becomes popular, they redo it and they sell it for like $10 or so. But that one over here sir, is this to my right? Why that one there really? That one there is not the real dress at all. And that's why you see when it comes to these kind of events Kareem, it's so important just work with a stylist or a designer because boy oh boy. Or you just don't pick the first outfit that you see on the thing. So no matter if you search the black and white because it was a black and white theme event, so no matter just search black and white and first thing you see pop up you just go through one. And say oh my god it's so gorgeous, just think in your brain. Other've gone up before and I see a boy in the same shoes as me and I'm going to change his shoes. I'm going to ask him.
