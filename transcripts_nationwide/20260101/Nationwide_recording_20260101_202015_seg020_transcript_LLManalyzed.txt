20260101 202015 I'm gonna live forever Baby remember my name Remember, remember, remember, remember Gloria You're always on the run now Running after somebody You've got to get them somehow I think you've got to slow down Before you start to blow it I think you're headed for a breakdown So be careful not to show it You really don't remember Was it something that hit you?
