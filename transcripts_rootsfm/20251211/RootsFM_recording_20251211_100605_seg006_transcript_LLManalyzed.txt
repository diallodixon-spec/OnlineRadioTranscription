I and I claim the victory through humility, discipline, and perseverance. What the mind can conceive and believe it can achieve through love, wisdom, commitment, focus, action, overstanding. I and I must achieve a spiritual renaissance, economic revitalization, and mastery over substance. The Zanli father, the earthly mother, and I are one. Health, wealth, and prosperity are I and I natural birthright. Blessed be the union that brings us abundance and opulence in all things divine. Let the words of God in my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable in thy sight.
