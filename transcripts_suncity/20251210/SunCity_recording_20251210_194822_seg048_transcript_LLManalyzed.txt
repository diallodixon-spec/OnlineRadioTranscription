You know, some people in Jamaica still don't get no water, no light. You'll be passing through St. Anne's last week. They say they're not getting the light. They don't know what they all know. Play for them. Through the storm we still remain Hand in hand we'll heal again All to many one proclaim When the sun comes back again Sun will shine, sun will shine Sun will shine
