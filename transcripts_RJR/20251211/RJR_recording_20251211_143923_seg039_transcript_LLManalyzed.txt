Hold me each evening in your arms, just like this. Tell me you love me for a million years. And if it don't work out, if it doesn't work out, then you can tell me goodbye Then if you must go I won't tell you no Still we can say we've tried Kiss me each morning for a million years Hold me each evening in your arms Tell me you love me
