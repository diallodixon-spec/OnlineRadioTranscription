20251223 205534 I've got the power! Hey, yeah, hey! Like the tug of the whip, I snap a shot front to back in this thing called rap. Diggin' like a shovel, rhyme double on a heavenly level. Fight the race, turn up the double. Flash on my day and night all the time. 7-14, fly up the line. Maniac, maniac, winning the game. I'm the lacle Jesse James Quality I possess Don't say I'm fresh When my voice goes through the mask I'm the right remote That I can hold it Copy written lyrics Only can't be slowed If they all snap Told you the police should try to save them, your voice insisted. So be, stay on my back or I will attack and you don't want that.
