20251224 174828 We can party all the night away Or enjoy the beaches where all the lovers stay You can take a swim and wash your tears away. Yeah. Jamming in the sun just like my mother said. Oh, I wait for all mankind, a wonder we can trace my son. Where there is no snow, Where there's good sense of need and growth. Oh, I wish that we could find true love at Christmas time. Don't have to be concerned. Show some love and that the peace might burn.
