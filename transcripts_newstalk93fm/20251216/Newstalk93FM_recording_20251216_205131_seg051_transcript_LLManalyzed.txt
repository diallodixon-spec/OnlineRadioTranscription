20251216 205131 is everlasting. I know love is everlasting. The world's so dark Turn the lights on Turn the lights on, turn the lights on, the world's so dark. Turn the lights on turn the lights on. Turn the light turn the world so dark. When it comes to musical thing, love is all I'm bring. Come on, pop'm a real lyrical sling like King David. And rhythm like this, we not play with love. A long time on the DJ, you not dance. A long time I not chant, you not dance, my company is up here, yeah.
