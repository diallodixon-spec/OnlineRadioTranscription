Peter Bunting. So I'm telling you, if you want to be informed about politics and what's being done, as well as being entertained by the Cotton's Trust of Parliament, you should watch Parliament whenever it's on on a Tuesday. But I guess not everybody can sit and watch and do that. So Kevin wants to know, Simon, you haven't seen the school buses in the area where you live? They can be seen all over the corporate area. Where do you live? Up in the hills with Michael, the coffee farmer. Nobody encouraged him to go out today. No, but I haven't seen them to be honest. I have seen them when I was in the country, but I have not seen them in town. The PM is spending public funds on his travels
