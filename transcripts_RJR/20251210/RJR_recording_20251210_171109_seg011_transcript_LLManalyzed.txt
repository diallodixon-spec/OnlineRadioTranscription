facilities and trucking the commodity to communities in need. Mr. Williams adds that the NWC also plans to outfit more of its facilities with generators to strengthen resilience during future power outages. Currently, we have, I think, over 60 pumps that have access or are running on generators. For instance, most of the 15,000 customers in St. Elizabeth today are being served by backup generators. You can't sustain that. That's why. So the challenge is when you have 600 facilities, pump stations and so on, and I think you might see one of the map, a map that we have with a whole heap of red dots, those are all the facilities that are dependent on power to operate. We do have some locations that we call them gravity feed, meaning the plant is at a high elevation up in the hills and the water then flows. So you don't need power for that? No.
