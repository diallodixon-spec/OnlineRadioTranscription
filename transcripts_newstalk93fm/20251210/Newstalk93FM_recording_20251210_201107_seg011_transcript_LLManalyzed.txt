Let me down again Cause I'm depending on you So you better come through this time Please hear my cry and if I ever Let you down my friend It was a misunderstanding So I thought you'd keep forgetting Don't I promise from today I'll go jump like I never jump up in the sky Tears running down we high Can't you tell that we sorry? We sorry And we need you back in real life I need you back, back, back Come on to me, come on to me Come on to me At least I know place to go
