You can't go depend on food somewhere. So I made sure I filled up before I came to this event. So there'll be no need for a lunch break on my part. So that's the situation. So what we're going to do now, we're going to take a break. Take a break. And when we come back, we hope to take you into the program proper here at the Pegasus Hotel. So now after I told you that I was going to take break, my producer came and said I should take a break. So there you go. It's not the tail wagging the dog. I'm not cliff fusing.
