2025-12-11 18:49:08 It won't be long, it won't be long But it seems like forever, yeah And it's all on my own Maybe cause I'm missing you now And it's driving me crazy Cause I'm needing my baby I need to see you Oh Meeting you right here by my side Is all that I can do My arms are down and I feel low at night
