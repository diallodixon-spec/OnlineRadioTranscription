When you're on the road, take it easy when you walk. Are you right? Are you drive safe, right? Leave your flying machine at home. At home, at home, at home. Yeah. Me have a signal from this family to your family. From this family, to your family. I love it, I love it! to your family. It's that time of year again. Time to spread good cheer again. Now try love and peace. Decorated with a smile. Then jump into our boats of happiness.
