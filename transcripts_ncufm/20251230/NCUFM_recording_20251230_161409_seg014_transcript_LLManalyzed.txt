20251230 161409 Sweet Jesus, sweet Jesus What a wonder you are You are brighter than a morning star You are fairer, much fairer Than the living and close by the wayside You are precious, more precious than gold So, so wonder Jesus can do. So, so wonder Jesus can do. Both are my bread, sugar, me cocoa.
