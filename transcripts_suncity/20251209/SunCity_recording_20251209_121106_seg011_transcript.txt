it. Glenmore High will look to strengthen their bid for a semifinal spot in the Asa da Costa Cup when they face McGrath High today at 3 p.m. on home soil. Glenmore and Cornwall College currently lead Group A with three points each following victories in their opening quarterfinal matches on Saturday. Another win today would move Glenmuir closer to a top-four berth. McGrath High last season runner-up are under pressure as a second straight quarterfinal loss and a third consecutive defeat overall could end their hopes of securing their first Acosta Cup title. The remaining quarterfinal fixtures will be played on Wednesday, including Caps Hill versus the Carnival College in Group A and the Cristiano versus Stets and Dintel versus Clarendon College in Group B.
