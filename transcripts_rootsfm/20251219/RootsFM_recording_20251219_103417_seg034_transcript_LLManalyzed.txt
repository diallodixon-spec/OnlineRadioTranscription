20251219 103417 St. Andrew's South Division, yes, especially for you, Taurus Riley, right here on Roots 96-1 on the FM Band. Christmas is to stay alive. And my old stop can't manage. I fill up my mama all when she not have it. She give me a little chocolate tea, a little porridge. Holiday time at school done. And nothing we need for your food.
