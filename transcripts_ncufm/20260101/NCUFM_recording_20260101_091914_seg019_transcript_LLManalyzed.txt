20260101 091914 or the first gospel where God speaks after Adam and Eve's fall. This is widely understood as the first prophecy of redemption pointing to the coming of Christ who would ultimately defeat Satan. This is more than judgment. It is the first announcement that evil will not reign forever. The serpent may strike, but the seed of the woman, pointing to Christ, will crush the serpent's head. Think about that for a second. Before Adam and Eve even left the garden, God had already declared victory. Before humanity had a plan, God had a promise. And that promise is not just ancient history. It is still alive for us today. It tells us evil does not have the final word.
