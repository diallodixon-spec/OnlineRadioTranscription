20251215 212114 Hey, I was doing just fine before I met you I drink too much and that's an issue, but I'm okay Hey, you tell your friends it was nice to meet them But I hope I never see them again I know it breaks your heart Moved to the city and I broke down crying Four years, no calls Now you're looking pretty in a hotel bar And I, I, I can't stop No, I, I I can't stop So babe, pull me closer In the backseat of your Rover That I know you can't afford Bite that tattoo on your shoulder Pull the sheets right off the corner Of the mattress that you sold From your roommate back in Boulder We ain't ever getting older
