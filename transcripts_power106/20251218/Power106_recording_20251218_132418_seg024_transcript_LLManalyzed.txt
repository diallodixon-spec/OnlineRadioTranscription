Yes, they've been by our side, you know, working alongside us to support the farmers and fill in the gaps. And so when we made the call to say, you know, hey, we have, we want to do some recovery kits for livestock. Radha told us exactly what we needed to put in the kits. And then we said to Baruch, this is what Rada says the farmers need. What can we do together? And so they put together this beautiful kit, provided it not just right away but also at a good cost because you know we want to try to reach as many farmers as possible through this initiative. So they've been with us from day one. Beautiful. Let's hear from Vanessa Chartre. Well, Vanessa, you said it all. That's what I call comprehensive. Absolutely. So let's head right into what you do at Baruch Distributors. We have about a couple minutes to go. All right. So I'm the managing director of Baruch. What we do is import veterinary pharmaceutical from across the world.
