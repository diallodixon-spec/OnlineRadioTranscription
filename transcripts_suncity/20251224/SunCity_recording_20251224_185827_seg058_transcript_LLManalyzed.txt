Maybe that's why you're bearing the cold so well over there in Canada, Johan, because you're used to, fade, fade, fade away His mercy is enduring for me Let's rise and shine And give Java glory His mercy enduring for me Make me free like a bird in a tree Let's sing and shout Here's you like Jason over there in the park. He said the coldest place is Linstead.
