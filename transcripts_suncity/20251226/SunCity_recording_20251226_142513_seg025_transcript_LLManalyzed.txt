20251226 142513 Here, here's Sean Braynor. Sometimes I feel like this is true love But what you wouldn't do love If me never got money And if it's not for rain Hope you remain the same girl Everyday with that sun Me see judge I see me blessing my way And you want to celebrate it's not for act funny Me see babies have them babies They do them in the cages They can't be stood up stop It's a toxic one. It's a plastic guy looking for love.
