**Interview with Councillor Darrington Ferguson**

In an exclusive interview on Newstalk93FM, Councillor Darrington Ferguson of the Papi Individual division shared his thoughts on the current state of his constituency and the challenges he faces in working with the Member of Parliament, Minister of Finance, Honorable Fayval Williams. Ferguson expressed his disappointment with the lack of cooperation from Minister Williams, stating that she operates within her own bubble and deflects his attempts to bring issues to her attention.

When asked about the relationship between himself and Minister Williams, Ferguson replied, "We have a mutual relationship. But when it comes to the works that is being done, I couldn't tell you what the MP is doing. I try my best to reach out to her. But she always deflect it." This lack of communication has hindered Ferguson's ability to address pressing issues in his division, including the removal of debris and domestic waste management.

Ferguson highlighted the struggles his constituents face due to the inadequate garbage collection services provided by the National Solid Waste Management Authority (NSWMA). He explained that the NSWMA is responsible for domestic garbage collection, but the service has been disrupted, leaving his constituents to deal with overflowing garbage. Ferguson has reached out to the executive director of the NSWMA, Audley Gordon, to discuss the challenges and potential solutions.

Despite these challenges, Ferguson remains committed to improving the lives of his constituents. He announced plans for a senior citizens' dinner, which will be held on Saturday, December 20th, in the African Gardens community. The event aims to bring together senior citizens from across the Papi Individual division, regardless of their political affiliation.

Ferguson also discussed the renovation of the Papi Individual market, which has been a collaborative effort between himself, the mayor of Kingston, and the wider KSA MC. The market has undergone significant improvements, making it a more comfortable and welcoming space for vendors and shoppers. Ferguson expressed his gratitude to the universities, UTEC and UWI, for their partnership in getting the project done.

As Christmas approaches, Ferguson is working to bring more hope and light to his constituents. He is in talks with local business people to explore ways to extend activities in the division and make the Christmas season more enjoyable for all. Despite the challenges, Ferguson remains optimistic and committed to serving his community.
