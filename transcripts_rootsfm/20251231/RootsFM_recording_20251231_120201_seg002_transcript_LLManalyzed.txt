20251231 120201 There are so many desperate situations that we are faced with. And as we pause for prayer this morning, this day, this night, we believe that your ears are not heavy, so you may not hear us. We know that as we pray, we believe that there is a way that we can seek your face and get answers. We believe that we can seek Your favor, Almighty God. We can seek Your help, Your grace, Your strength, your provision, and sometimes we even seek a miracle on behalf of any person or situation where the need is required for our Savior's deliverance.
