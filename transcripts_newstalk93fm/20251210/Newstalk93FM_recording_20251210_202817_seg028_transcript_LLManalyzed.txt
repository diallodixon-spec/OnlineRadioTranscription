What I apply for my belly, you giving me energy. I don't need to lose my composure, cause me losing control. Giving me more than I need. Everything where you got it for party. Even if what I got in me pepe. No fit to device, you my old reggae. My rhythm, my blues. My activity, all the things from Monday to Sunday. Say you be my gold, nobody do me like you do My music on my muse Everything my baby, My rhythm and blues, So many things you did do, nobody Do me cause you play happy to lose Cause in my love put it all on you and I get the money
