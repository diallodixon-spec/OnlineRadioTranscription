20260102 160305 Sun City 104.9 FM Young people just listen out. Try to do things the right way. Strive to be your best. Life is just a test. Respect yourselves in every way. Hands in a brother's hands and steps. Keep your head up and ring that doorbell. Hey little brothers. Hey little sisters. This is the day, this is the day to say.
