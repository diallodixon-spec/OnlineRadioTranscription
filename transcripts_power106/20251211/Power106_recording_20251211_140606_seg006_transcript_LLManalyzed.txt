You praise to that Father your heart not made of stone Praise him in the big church or in your little home Huck up all God's children like your very own You will never feel alone For God sits on the throne Peace and la on th throne So let us plan to serve him, it's our turn for the deed Put away all enmity, all selfishness and greed Brother and sisters keep our word
