I'm looking for a new love, baby, a new love. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Was she hot? Did she turn you out? Curiosity rules my brain. Was she worth my heart? It's torn all apart. Are you going back again? Tell me. My love was true, still you threw it all away. But now you're like a rest, unworthy of my best.
