20251224 092213 be born now this child that's born it's born not from the blood of a man which is contaminated but from god it's immaculate conception right so there is no contamination of sin that comes through adam so every human being born on the planet they born with a sin nature when jesus was born because it wasn't the seed of adam coming through the generations It was of god immaculate conception. It was pure untainted undefiled And it was not with the sin that adam sinned with and that's why jesus had to enter into the world into a body And then give me born. That's why in john chapter three. He says that unless you are born of water and of the flesh, you cannot be born again. And what he's showing here, Jesus came into the earth through a physical body, Mary, spiritually by God. So now we have Jesus Christ manifest.
