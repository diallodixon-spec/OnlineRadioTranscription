2025-12-12 15:12:32 And isn't it amazing how sometimes that good word comes right when we need it most? It might be a friend's gentle reminder that we're not alone. It might be a scripture that suddenly feels alive, or even a stranger's smile that breaks through the fog. God designed words to carry weight, not just to inform, but to transform. When our hearts are heavy, encouragement is like oxygen. It breeds life back into weary souls. That's why Proverbs 12 verse 25 reminds us, we don't have to stay stooped under the weight of worry. A single word of truth spoken in season can lift us up and set our spirits dancing again.
