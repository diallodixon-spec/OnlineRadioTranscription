From the great to the sky Lord I lift your name on high Oh Lord You came from heaven to earth to show the way Oh my savior From the earth to the cross My destiny From the cross to the grave From the grave to the sky Lord, I lift your name on high. Lord, my Lord, I lift Your name on high. How I love to sing Your praises. And I'm so glad You're in my life. Oh, and I'm so glad You came to save us. You came from heaven to show the way on the earth to us.
