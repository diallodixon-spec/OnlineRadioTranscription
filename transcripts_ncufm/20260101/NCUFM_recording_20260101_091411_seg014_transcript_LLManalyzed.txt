20260101 091411 I won't let you go until you bless me. Bless me. I won't let go to you. Bless me. Until you bless me. Clocking out weary. Sony touch the sky. Sometimes the white gets lost behind these tired eyes. But I won't trade this journey, only go the bright. Will you bless me? Come and bless me. Take, take that easy road, and choose your narrow way. I know I'll make it, if you come stand by me. Something tells me that you hear me. Come and bless me, come and bless me Oh, I won't let you talk till you bless me Won't let you talk until you bless me
