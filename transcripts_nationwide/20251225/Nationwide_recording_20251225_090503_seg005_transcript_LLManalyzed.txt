20251225 090503 In that spirit, I encourage each of us to show kindness by checking on the vulnerable, sharing what we have, offering encouragement, supporting community efforts, and extending patience and compassion in our daily lives. May this season renew our strength, unite us in purpose, and fill our hopes with peace. May God bless you know reducing the use of cash at toll locations makes it safer for everyone involved?
