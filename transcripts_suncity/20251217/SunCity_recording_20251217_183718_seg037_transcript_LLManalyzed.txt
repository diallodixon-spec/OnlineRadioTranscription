20251217 183718 Hey guys, it is your girl Queen Jojo. It is a print big reggae Wednesday. And as promised, we have an interview right now on the heat wave with Sanjog Alipatch. All right. So reggae lovers are in for a treat as Humble Lion production and the Mecca Concerts join forces to stage an exciting event dubbed Luciano and Friends featuring the legendary original downbeat sound system. The concert promises powerful performances, rich reggae heritage and a celebration of conscious music. And joining us this evening to share more details is the representative from the events promoters Humble Lion. Good evening, Humble Lion. How are you doing? Good evening, my dear. Great things, you know? Yeah, right? Yeah, man, we bless, you know? You're excited about tomorrow's event. Definitely. Lovely, lovely. Now, to start things off, can you tell us when and where the Lucien and Friends concert will be held and what patrons can expect tomorrow night?
