20251219 115842 Be glorified today in our relationships, in our families, in our places of work and play. Be glorified today. In our nation and beautiful Jamaica, be glorified today. Lord, you have created us to worship and serve you, but many of us have become derailed. We have worshipped ourselves and we have placed our loyalties in the things you have created instead of in you, the Creator. Forgive us, Lord, of our transgressions and bring us back to you before it is too late. Help us to consider the things that are of ultimate value.
