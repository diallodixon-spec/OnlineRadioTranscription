20260101 103022 I've been around and I've never seen another one Because your style ain't really got nothin' on And you out when you ain't got nothin' on Baby, you the whole package, plus you pay your taxes And you keep it real while the mothers stay plastic You're my Wonder Woman, call me Mr. Fantastic Stop, now think about it I've been to London, I've been to Paris, everywhere there in Tokyo Back home down in Georgia, to New Orleans But you always stay the show And just like that, girl, you got me froze Like a Nintendo 64 If you never knew it, now you know No, no, no, no Beautiful girls, all over the world I could be chasing, but my time would be wasted They got nothing on you, nothing on you
