20251212 162928 All the very best to you as well, Voice of Florida. Thank you so much for the call today. You too. Take care. Bye bye now. Bye bye. Bye bye. Wow. Wow. A lot to take from that. And we will keep at it. We will definitely keep at it here on PAW 106 FM. You know, it's quite interesting when you think of the topics that we have analyzed since Melissa, you know, and these topics will continue to be prominent in our programming going forward and we will not shirk from that responsibility. Time for another break here on both sides of the story, your calls and messages even more when we come back.
