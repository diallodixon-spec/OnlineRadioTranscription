20251218 121510 I don't want no dirty secrets fighting me and you, boy I could only drive one car at a time But I still want to, but I still want to And let me get to the truth, truth, truth I just wanna live good, good, good Jesus! I know it might hot up your head now. I hope I didn't set up myself. Love comes from a place where we don't get jealous. And we don't live like no dream sellers. I say we keeping it real. I'm telling you like it is, baby. I'll be there for you with anything you're facing. I'll be your sunlight when it's true.
