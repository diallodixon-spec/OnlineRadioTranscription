20251225 211511 So let me tell you something. Hear my speech kind of slow when it's a rum thing. Keep a smile on your face cause it's a fun thing. And baby, you finna say I'm a dumpling. Cause when you walk, hear me whistle low. Can't wait for you to catch under me mistletoe Hold up on me girl and make me kiss you slow Heaven lost an angel oh you're pretty so The only gift I'd like Is you on Christmas night I don't want an icy Christmas I've had enough The only ice I wanna see must be in my cup I don't want a icy Christmas
