initial questions about reparations. I am wholeheartedly in support of reparations for slavery. Do I think we'll ever get them? I doubt it. I doubt it. But I'm totally in favor of our push to get reparations and the justifiable claim. I would exclude you from that, though, because I don't think anybody should give you any money for anything, especially for being stupid. Simon O'Callaghan just spoke about the silence of the PSOJ regarding some government issues. He shouldn't be surprised, as Tiago just told you, the government and the PSOJ are working together and can criticize their own advice. Seems the PSOJ office is that of the executive branch of the government.
