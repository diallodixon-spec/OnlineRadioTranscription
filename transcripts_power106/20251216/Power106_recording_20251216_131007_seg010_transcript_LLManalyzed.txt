20251216 131007 life, Alvin. Don't worry yourself. Part of life. Yeah, but some changes have to come. Errol, how are you doing? I'm good, Dr. Gill. Bless up, my brother. Enjoy your program daily. Yes, man. Thank you. John Rouse. What you were saying, you were perfectly right. I know you did express it, but how can you basically say what I was going to say? Because this is kind of ridiculous. How can we, I'm saying, how can we give a 7% increase when at the same time, I want to know if none of the workers now have JPS, they're not going to get no raise. How are they going to pay this 70% increase? Can you explain that to me sir? But that is why I was saying it sounds like the story in the Bible where God was mercy
