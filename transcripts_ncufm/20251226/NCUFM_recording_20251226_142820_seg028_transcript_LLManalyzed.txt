20251226 142820 Today's a new day, but there is no sunshine Nothing but clouds and it's dark in my heart and it feels like a cold night It ain't easy A power that I can't explain. That holy ghost power, y'all. Fell from heaven like a shower down. And I know we've been hurt, y'all, but still. I smile. Come on. Even though I hurt, see I smile. Y'all feel that? I know God is working, so I smile. Even though I'm in it for you.
