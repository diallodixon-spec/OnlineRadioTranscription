20251224 122511 I'm pleased to be killing in the West Indies To provide all my wants and needs I got the sunshine, rivers and trees Green leaves, playa When the rain pits a pot on the roof Herb just a steamed pepper pot on the skew Like it's a dream if you got gratitude So go tell the regime they can't stop where we do now. Information you think on your own, or else you're a slave to the things that you know. What do you know if you learn every day? So be careful of things where you're sad. Who knows? Who knows, who knows, who knows? I just go with the train wind blows. Sending love to my friends and foes. And I suppose I'm pleased to be chilling in the West Indies. The provider not once I need. I got the sunshine.
