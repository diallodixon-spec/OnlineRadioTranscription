20251222 172920 and you are listening to the voices of team captain Deandre Wright Barnett, head coach Omar Wedderburn and principal Keith Wellington and Mr Wellington joins us. He's also the father of Malik Wellington and we saw some of those celebrations with them on social media. We also have Malik with us, the vice captain of states and also the captain Deandre right Barnett. Thank you all so much. We're hoping to be joined by the head coach of our weather burn in just a moment. But Mr. Wellington, Deandre Malik, thank you so much for talking to us. We really do appreciate it. I tell you what, let me ask you to hold on for just a moment. Let me just take a break, do some business and we'll come right back to y'all. Okay.
