20251226 151415 I wish I could put by the page of my memory Cause I put too much energy in me Can we tell I could do this fast? Cause it's killing me To where we can't rewrite our own history Such a mystery, when he's here with me It's hard to believe I'm still alone with me Chances fading now, patients running out This ain't how it's supposed to be I'm hurting like glass, just sleeping with the enemy How do we reverse the chemistry? I don't want us to be the enemy This love is taking all of my energy Taking all of my energy
