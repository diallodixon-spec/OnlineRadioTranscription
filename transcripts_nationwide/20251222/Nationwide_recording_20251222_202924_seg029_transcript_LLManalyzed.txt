20251222 202924 So I'm livin' this I never limit myself to else Fearless, laid back while I illuminate the darkness Like it's smooth, don't ya? Make it move, won't ya? Think I won't? Take it to your peak I know the mother cats don't and it won't stop This is beyond paper First I get your mind right, then I might drape ya Never pimp it, raise my girls well Young thoroughbreds get schooled by Uncle LL C double, L tattooed on the bubble Lay the mink down, let you walk over a puddle True love to me. I'll see your life, I'll take it to paradise. I'm gonna give it all for you. If you want sunshine, I could call you my baby boy. You could call me your baby girl. Maybe we could spend some time.
