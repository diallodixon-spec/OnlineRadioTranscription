20251215 112417 like come on yeah go ahead yes so I'm saying I'm not aware of the so-called taxes exempt card what I do know about was there was an effort some years ago to establish what they were calling a currency for maroons to use in Jamaica in in maroon country our territory Lumi LUMI, L-U-M-I, and there was a big controversy over it and how valid it was in relation to the laws governing the issuer, insurance of currency in Jamaica. But no, this is new to me. Well, I mean, even the chat people are calling the name of because the guy was Ellie and he they're saying because it was on TikTok. And I said, let me ask him on Monday if he has ever heard like a card. It's not like the money is like a card where you're exempt.
