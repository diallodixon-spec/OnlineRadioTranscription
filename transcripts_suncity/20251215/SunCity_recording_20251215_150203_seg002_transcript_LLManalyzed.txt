20251215 150203 God is always there for me Through the good times or through the bad Through the happy times or through the sad God is always there for me. I met this old man. He was so bold. He didn't hold a baton, so he slapped on the floor. He's always smiling. I never heard him complain. said I've proven God again and again So no matter what the circumstances may be God is always there for me
