You are the owner of space You're the restoreer of my soul When you turn your noise into you And feel the soul in this space In my heart, in your heart I have to worship And I love to honor I love to worship. I love to honor. I love to lift up. No other name, no other name. You are my Father. You're my provider. And I love to live up to Your name. I love to let down my whole name I love to worship you Lord I love honor I love to let you down my whole name You are my Father
