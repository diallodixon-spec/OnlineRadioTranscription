Welcome back as we wrap up the news right here on Roots 90 Sports. Glenmuir High will attempt to strengthen their push for a semifinal spot in the Issa da Costa Cup this afternoon when they face McGrath High at 3 o'clock in May Penn. Glenmuir and Cornwall College sit on top of Group A with three points each after opening wins on Saturday, and another victory today would move Glenn Muir within touching distance of the Final Four. McGrath last season's runner-up are in danger of slipping out of contention. They have lost their last two games, failing to score in both, and another defeat would end their hopes of winning a first da Costa Cup title. Their recent form is sharp, contrast to their strong start in the playoff.
