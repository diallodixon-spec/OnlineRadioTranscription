Hopefully you enjoyed your holiday season. Matthew J. Wright, y'all know Matthew, right? I gotta say thank you very much to Matthew. Matthew held things down while we were away and obviously Matthew knew the schedule, right? And knowing the schedule, Matthew, when we're talking about it, Matthew was recognizing the schedule and what the schedule would be. And he said, Michael, I think I'm going to have a wonderful holiday break. This was a good one for Matthew, too, for different reasons. But Michael, come talk to me. Talk to the drive time family. Yeah. Good afternoon, everybody. My time on the drive. Tell me.
