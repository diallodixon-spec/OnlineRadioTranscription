20251216 182113 My love, the days are colder So let me take your hand and lead you through a snow-white land My love, the year is older So let me hold you tight and while away this winter night, oh I see the firelight in your eyes Come kiss me now before it dies We'll find a winter world of love, cause love is warmer in December. My darling, stay here in my arms till summer comes along.
