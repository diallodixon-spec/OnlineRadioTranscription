20251219 152347 I've made a lot of bad moves. I know you could walk away, but you never do. I've met a lot of cold hearts. I've learned to smile and deceive. I know I'm hard to be around, but you never leave. I'm not easy to understand, but you hold out your hand. And you say you love me just as I am. You always treat me the best that you can. You say you want me, need me, love me.
