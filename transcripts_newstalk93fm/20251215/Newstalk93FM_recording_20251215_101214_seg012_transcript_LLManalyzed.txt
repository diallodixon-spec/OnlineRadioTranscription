20251215 101214 stone that is hanging a concrete structure that I had highlighted months ago that if the river was not, any attention was paid to the river, that that house would have been under threat. Sure enough, Hurricane Melissa came and the house partially is hanging over the cliff because all the land, the acreage of land that surrounded that house is now washed away. And one of the bedrooms of this three-bedroom house is hanging over the cliffs. So the young lady who lives and owns this house had to leave the house and have nowhere to live. And urgent attention needs to be given to her. I'm really asking for assistance for that family. Who did you reach out to address this matter?
