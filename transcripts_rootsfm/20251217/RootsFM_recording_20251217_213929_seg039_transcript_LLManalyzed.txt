20251217 213929 Don't waste your time Because the dog is mine I love you more than he But I love you endlessly So come and call me to undone But we both did not have a soul It's one or the other And one thing you'll discover is that she's my girl forever and ever. She loves to be let down, so I really feel it's mine. But I know she'll tell you all about my love, because she said I'm her man.
