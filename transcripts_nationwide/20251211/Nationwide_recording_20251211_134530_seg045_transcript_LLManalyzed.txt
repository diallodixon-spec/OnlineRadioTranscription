To let you know How much I care And I won't let go Even though the ocean's away You're with me Day by day Memories of you keep flashing through my mind The very thought of you make my time Hello mama, I've been so confused Don't know what to do Baby, have I told you? Things wouldn't be so easy I have a family and they're depending on me I know you wish there was no one else But you don't have to tell me You won't upon yourself But, come it now
