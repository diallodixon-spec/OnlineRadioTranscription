20251215 161108 be ashamed. It's not, you know, so let me say this with your respect, Mr. Jesse. We have a lot to be thankful of Jamaica and Jamaica, I see Jamaican people as one of the most kind people, you know, away from, and we are African in a sense. And all we have to do is try to live like brothers and don't make politics need a PNP or JP. Divide us. But don't really try to carry down our brothers and sisters. I don't bring them to a certain level. Because you don't know a next man level, you know. So I don't try to bring them down to your level. Because I am Rastafari and most of my clothing when we are African, too. When we dress, no disrespect because none of us are. We look like like a prince because I see myself as that, you hear? Just have a nice day and I greet you now again and I always have to say power 106 is second number one radio program because I'm not arguing, I am here for him to come, he's running after us.
