20260102 133818 Well, today is a new day. Give thanks to life. I pray this to the Lord, me see you for me sanctify. Nah, me don't stress me. Me a wall of vines. With bread, womb, tea, chair, and moon in me board to find. And the Lord is around us us in blessings around us. For me, I come from a better journey. Good things that got me. Faith in your faith. For me I come from life has meaning. Death and you keep on believing.
