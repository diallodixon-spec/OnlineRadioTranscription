20260102 120706 is expected to be accelerated with the arrival of more linesmen and equipment to assist the Jamaica Public Service Company. Energy Minister Daryl Vaz says the second barge of equipment arrived last night. Mr. Vaz says this will help to get the remaining 10% of affected JPS customers, approximately 70,000 Jamaicans, in the worst affected parishes reconnected by the end of January. He says 152 trucks and an assortment of equipment and other vehicles were moved from Kingston today to the most affected parishes. The equipment was officially handed over to the Light and Power Company at its Hunts Bay station on Marcus Garvey Drive this morning. Addressing the ceremony, Prime Minister Dr. Andrew Holness said the decision of the government to facilitate the financing of the JPS to accelerate the recovery of electricity grid is justified. So today we can stand here the second day in the new year to welcome over 270 trucks, I believe.
