20251222 205347 I'll be a freak of soy Walk on the floor And everybody was jammin' They're playin' my favorite song And they're singin' along Can't turn your back for a minute Somebody's rockin' my man. Girls, they're doing like nobody else can. Watch out, watch out, watch out. Excuse me, lady, this man's with me. I don't like to share. You can play with me. He looks good, good enough to eat. But believe me, lady, he belongs to me. I'll meet him in the ladies' room. I'll be back real soon. Oh, oh, oh, oh. I got to meet him in the lady's room.
