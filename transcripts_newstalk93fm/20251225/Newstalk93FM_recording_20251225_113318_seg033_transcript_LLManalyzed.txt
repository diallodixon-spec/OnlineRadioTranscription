20251225 113318 We drive one car at a time But I still want to, but I still want to Cause everything is balance Right through life what we want is balance To be a good wife what you need is balance Bend down, touch your toes, go low and balance Love comes from a place where places. Yeah, yeah. I'll be by your side no matter the case. We have a one-way ticket to greatness You're not the one to lie Cause I believe in the truth And I just wanna live good I don't want no dirty secrets fighting me and you boy I could only drive one car at a time
