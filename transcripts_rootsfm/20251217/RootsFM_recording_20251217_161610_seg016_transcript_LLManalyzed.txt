20251217 161610 Be ashamed. Let your conscience be your guide. No deep down inside. I believe you love me. Don't forget your foolish pride. Don't lie to me. If you are serious, don't play with my heart makes me furious but if you want me to love you baby i will baby i will tell it like it. I've been so lonely and cry all night. Why do I seem to be caught up inside a dream all my life?
