Look at me now. I'm the star of the night. Like Martin Luther King. My dream, my dream, my dream. Tell you my dream is to live my dream Here the most time I'm sleeping safe Tell you my goal my goal my goal All of my goal is to reach my goal Live a happy life put it on my headstone Nobody nothing cry over me dead Look at me now when I'm dreaming
