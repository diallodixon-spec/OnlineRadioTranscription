============================================================

In the mirror Reflections of your lovely face With tears in my eyes As I give answer to the father Who'll be holding such wonderful treasure All along There's never a day I don't think about you My mind's a mess And my heart's in distress No, I never can understand it The way the system plan There's no hope, no chance No loophole, no escape for a sufferer man Cause every time I lift my head above water I try to save myself from the trap There's an overnight scheme all worked out Designed to keep me down, still out Putting up a resistance Pull up! Yo! Pull up! Pull up!
