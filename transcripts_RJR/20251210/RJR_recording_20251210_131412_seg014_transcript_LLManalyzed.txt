something that you told me found a way straight to my heart it feels just like you've known me from another life worlds apart yeah cause you put that fire in me that burning desire in me and I ain't used to feeling like this but your love runs so deep ooh the way you give good love to me is right on time and I was just about to give on up but you came right on time. And I was just about to give on up, but you came right on time. When I was done, I was too fed up. But you came and you showed right away.
