============================================================

To think I'd find someone new One who'd love me better than you Well, it may come as a surprise Loneliness has opened my eyes That's why every love I could find Still I can't get you out of my mind Cause there's no one in the world to hold me No one in the world's gonna move me No one in love can love me like Do, do, baby Every time I'm with someone and And loving you, yes, I wanna run I wanna run back to your arms again Ain't no one in the world Loves me like you do
