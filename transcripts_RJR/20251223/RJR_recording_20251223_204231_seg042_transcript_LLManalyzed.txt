20251223 204231 Talk about compression, or nerve, or irritation in the neck. Courtney, our first caller that evening from Portmore, was talking about having a disc bulge in the neck. Exactly, and a disc bulge is one of the things that can cause a radiculopathy. Now, we also looked at goats after that in the beginning of June, so no misses. They're doing well. Yes, yes, yes. But before we touch on that June 3 program, I want to say a quick hello to Auntie Jackie over by Riversdale. Because is that Crawl Riversdale, Auntie Jackie? So. Wonderful greetings to you. I know that you are one of our listeners wanting to say a good evening as well to Sir Uton sending greetings to us, Doc, and we also wish for him all the very best. Have a wonderful evening.
