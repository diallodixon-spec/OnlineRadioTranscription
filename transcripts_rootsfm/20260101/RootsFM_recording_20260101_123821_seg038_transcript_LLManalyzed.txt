20260101 123821 was not what I had planned. And now I'm not so sure just where I stand. I wasn't looking for true love, but now you're looking at me. You're the only one I can think of, you're the only one I can think of You're the only I see All I feel Is just a little more time To be sure What I feel Is it all in my mind Cause it seems so hard to believe That you're all I need Yes it's true, we've all been hurt before
