20251229 121211 Terrapet, my terrapet. It took away all of my anxiety. Anxiety, my remedy. I tell you that we all need love. Jump up and show me love. Wait up, and show me love, together. Say we all need love, jump up and show love, wait up and show love. So come if we shun that together. No place that I rather be. Shun that together. Right now is our energy. Oh My body's not keep up. Take your troubles and throw them all away. Get ready to run across the stage. Get ready, get ready. Give me energy, real energy. I said it's OK from top to bottom.
