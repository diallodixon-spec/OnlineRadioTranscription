I was making earlier is that if members of parliament were better at being stewards of their constituencies, and by that I mean, I would want to see an MP say, look at what I've done for the constituency. I managed to convince this company to invest here and so the factory is opening up here which guarantees a certain amount of jobs. I've been able to get the NHT to invest in low income housing and create this scheme and that scheme. Those things to me would be more valuable than attending some funeral. But in the absence of those now, to endear yourself to the electorate, you have to do all of those other things that I mentioned, which is what Scott is saying.
