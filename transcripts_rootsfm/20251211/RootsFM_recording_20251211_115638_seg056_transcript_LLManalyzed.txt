from online so everything is in the system so you going in is just a presence because all the documentation everything is there and suppose I tell you that from the day date and time that you send in that application investigation starts so they're not waiting on your appointment to start their investigation so it's important that we recognize what it is that we're doing all right how, how long it takes to get the police record? Depends on what you pay for. 21 days, regular, work, express five working days, all right? And then, yes, you can, can I apply or I deny a police record? Yes, you can appeal, sorry, the decision or apply for a waiver. Get a lawyer when you have a situation like that, because you would need guidance. If your police record application is denied due to a criminal conviction, you can apply for waiver. I don't think it applies for murder.
