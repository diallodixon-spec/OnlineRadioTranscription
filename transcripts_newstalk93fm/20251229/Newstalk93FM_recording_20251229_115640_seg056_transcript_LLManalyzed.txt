20251229 115640 Like we ain't leaving this place We ain't going nowhere We not leaving this place Hey, anybody fix Tell them fly over We jammin' all on the shoulder Y'all listen, we're moving closer Send your bumper right over Then drop it lower Then walk it slower Watch me in your red view mirror Girl, you are the greatest You'll always be my favorite No matter what we face it Don't worry at all We go in places On all the biggest stages We on the road need traffic jam. Because in a ceiling, darling, the tongue is traffic jam. All that's wrong is a traffic jam. Why don't you need traffic jam? Girl, bright and early. Monday morning. Tuesday evening. Bump out a fender. Traffic jam. Bump out the fender.
