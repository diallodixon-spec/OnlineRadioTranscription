20251222 181009 I'm droning alone and I'm lost in my feelings Somebody send me a sign cause you you that we all need love. Jump up and show me love. Wait up, and show me love, together. Say we all need love, jump up and show love, wait up, and show love. Soca makes we stronger together. No place that I'd rather be Show not together Right now is our energy Show not together So calm is our pattern Show not together I tell you so much on my mind That I can't sleep I stress it all the time I can't stop
