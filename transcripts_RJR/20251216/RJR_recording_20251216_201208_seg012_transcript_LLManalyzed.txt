No, I've not I don't deal with infections I should say let's say that first off. I do not treat infections And so anybody that has an infection in their muscles and they're here with our primary site is tonight I don't don't want to call my office in the morning and say, I have pyrolysis, I want Dr. Garner to come treat me because I do not treat infections. You're going to tell us where. So you go, you go to a medical provider to get infections dealt with. All right. They are the ones who are trained to handle that level problem. Okay. Not chiropractors. We just use our hands to realign things. We can't kill bacteria with our hands. Bacteria is like a mosquito, you know? You just use your hand and box them. If that were the case, then I could treat bacterial infections. But bacteria are much smaller, so I can't. All right.
