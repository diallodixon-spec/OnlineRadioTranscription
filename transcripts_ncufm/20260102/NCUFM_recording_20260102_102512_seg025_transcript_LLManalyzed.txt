20260102 102512 You know it was your word, and it was the truth Never loving truth, you were always right, all you do is real Truth comes from you, and it's only you Turning through the pages of the Bible of the ages, it was real All you do is real Everything you've written down, I will depend on being sound I know it was real It was your word It was nothing but your word that inspired the men It was your word. You were nothing but the word that will teach us again. All you ever said before, no matter what it was, it was the truth. Every time you spoke of when the voice of God was being heard, I know it was true. It was the truth.
