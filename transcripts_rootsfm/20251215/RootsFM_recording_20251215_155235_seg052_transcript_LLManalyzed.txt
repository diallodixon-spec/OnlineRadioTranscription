20251215 155235 I'm on the board with Stone Love and myself. One more one. How does it look though in terms of patrons supporting Weddy Weddy each and every Wednesday or is it every Wednesday?

Yeah. So, is it anything goes up there in terms of the music? No. You have a selective set of songs that you said. These are for a batch of people at a certain time. Yes.

At a certain time, like, I'm going to give the full details how it would look now. a certain time, like after seven, you'll find father power and friends like Errol Rock, you know, and Joe Goldus, vinyl boss, and whatever vinyl play, and mostly vintage people were there like years before me.
