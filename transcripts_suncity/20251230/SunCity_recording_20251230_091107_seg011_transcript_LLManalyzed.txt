20251230 091107 My reflection is proof that the world became me. I don't hustle for value. I embody. I don't pray in panic. I pray in authority. Nothing about me is waiting to happen. It's all unfolding publicly. I'm already chosen before I ever apply. You can see it in my eyes. You can get rid my life I don't force what's mine It comes because I'm alone I'm not becoming the one I am the one Everything meant for me recognizes me on sight No delay, blessings, just to find time and then fly. Side track by existing ride. I don't evolve into her, I remember her. I'm already her, told her before.
