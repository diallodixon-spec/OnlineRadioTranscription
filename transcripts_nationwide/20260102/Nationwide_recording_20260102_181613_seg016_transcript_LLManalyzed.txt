As president of the Jamaica Boxing Association, JBA's Stephen Bomber Jones says elevation will be the key word guiding the organization's plans as it seeks to improve the profile of the sport locally. Jones noted that the association is intent on raising standards both inside and outside the ring, with renewed emphasis on infrastructure, athletic development and visibility. Central to that push will be the refurbishment of the Stanley Coach Gym, which Jones identified as the association's top priority. He explained that upgrading the facility will allow it to serve as the JBA's main base of operations, providing a consistent and professional training environment for boxers, coaches and officials.
