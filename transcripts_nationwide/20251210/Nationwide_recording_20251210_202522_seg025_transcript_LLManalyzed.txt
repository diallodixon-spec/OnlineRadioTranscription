You are expert, but this is not a word Swear my walk alone, you will have me You deserve to be the girl, now you know I can't fly I stand behind for more than words But yeah, I can't hide my words I'm not doing a sin, but I'm just at the top of my mind So try not to take offence,'t know what the world is like for me Can I not change? I changed, I got it full of sense Won't come and make me play safe and won't repent Turn me down I'll win the world again Get with me Cause it's full of strength Don't rock it like a boat from the water bed So tell me how you feel about it? Let me know I I'll be ready if you carry her, oh gosh A regular, you're less fast But this time we off, we connected like that I'm a crazy for you, you're top tier, you attend And if I tell you the truth, you are my best boyfriend Move it right through, it's a pain in the ass
