20251212 201812 I can't get you off my mind, no Without you love is blind I need you oh so bad When you're away life is so sad. Please stay close to me. Don't ever leave me, oh no, lovely. Stick by me and make me happy. When my eyes can't see you And my heart can't feel you You got to come and believe in me You got to make me happy You got come and believe me
