20251219 091512 to do my architectural practice. So I spent about 15 years in London. And then I came back home about six or seven years ago to be the program director at the school. So I've been through Europe, been through London, and it has been a remarkable experience to be back home. I don't know for how many persons who are away from home like I used to be but you know there's nothing like finding your sense of purpose here at home and you know as an architect with all that experience you know what's the point of it if you're not building home all right so that's one of the reasons why I came back okay great yeah I have a little bit of ideas to what it is like to live abroad, yeah, but being home without any question. 1988 to now, you're better at maths than me. That's how many years? 36 years. My gosh, that's a lifetime. Yes.
