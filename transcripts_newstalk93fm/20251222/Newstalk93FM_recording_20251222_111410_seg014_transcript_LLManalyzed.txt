20251222 111410 You're taking me out of the ordinary. I want you laying me down to the dead and buried. On the edge of your knife, staying drunk on your vine. The angels up in the clouds are jealous knowing we've found something so wild. We're the ordinary. You got me kissing the ground. We're the sanctuary. Shatter touch, oh Lord, return me to dust The Breathe it, take my breath away. At your altar, I will pray. You're the sculptor, I'm the clay. Oh, my, my, you're taking me up.
