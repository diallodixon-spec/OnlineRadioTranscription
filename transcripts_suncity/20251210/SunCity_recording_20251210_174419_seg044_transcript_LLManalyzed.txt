Shoutouts to Angie, got it locked in right now. Angie said, yes, Ali, blaze the fire. No, I didn't give you... Okay, so she says, Ali, please give my shoutouts to the Sunites. All right, sorry I didn't give it earlier here. My apologies. Angie's always looking out for her brothers and sisters from Sun City. We appreciate that so much. Yeah, Angie, think of yourself. All right, shoutouts to one son, Ja Juan Son over there in New York City. Got it locked in himself. Big up to Karel. Karel Doofus from Jane Street, Toronto. All right, Karel, bless up yourself coming from Ja Juan Son. Charles Morris over there on the wall, Tom. Big up yourself, me general. All right, let's get into the music. It's now 15 minutes to 6 p.m. Nonstop reggae music here on a pretty big priority deal, Reggae Wednesday. Here we go.
