20251218 095937 I'm not shaking, I'm never unbalanced. I'm not a girl alone, I can't have romance because... I love women and that's what I think. The girls sugar on me, I defend them. The girls see me and they fling it on me. The girls call me them poppies. I love women and they're what I think. Girls swing on me.
