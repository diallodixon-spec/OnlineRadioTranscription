20260101 090905 Everything you shall be, but tonight I need you. Every promise that He made, it will come to pass. He won't go back on His word. Every promise, that He made, He won't come to pass. Keep trusting the baby, hold fast. I can't tonight, until He comes. Every promise that I made, it's taking, Lord. I'll stand right here on your word, Father. What you said, that settles it. I don't have to get any other reassurance. I know what you told me is going to happen. Listen. He is not ready for life if he's ready.
