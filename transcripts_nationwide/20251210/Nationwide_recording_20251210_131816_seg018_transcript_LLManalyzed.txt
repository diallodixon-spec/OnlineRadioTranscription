Ooh, baby, baby, I'm dancing with a stranger Look what you made me do, I'm with somebody new Ooh, baby, and dancing with a stranger Dancing with a stranger I wasn't even going out tonight But boy, I need to get you off of my mind I know exactly what I have to do I don't wanna be alone tonight Alone tonight Alone tonight I want you to stay, till I'm in the grave Till I run away, dead and buried Till I'm in the casket
