20251231 160607 house is damaged you go and shut the main shut off off but these things are very flimsy my i'm telling you yeah the infrastructure they're very flimsy they they don't put them on the ground right they don't cover them so but they don't bury them deep enough for sure they don't burry them deep enough yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah i mean so the, we gotta look at how these people going around who do their jobs. People complain about flow, that the flow lines, the people are coming about flow. Most of the lines are so close to the ground, if a truck try to go into a yard or anything, they tear them down. I'll guess what they do. It was on a roll, you know. You're getting no arguments from me in terms of infrastructure. No arguments from me whatsoever.
