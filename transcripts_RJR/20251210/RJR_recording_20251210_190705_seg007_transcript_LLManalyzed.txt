My train of choice was the Long Island Railroad. The railroad now didn't have as many vagrants like the subway. It was more middle and upper class people that rode the railroad in those days. So I would get on the train at night and ride back and forth, back and forth until one night the conductor said to me, what stop are you getting off ma'am? They said I'm not getting off and he advised me to move closer to the front
