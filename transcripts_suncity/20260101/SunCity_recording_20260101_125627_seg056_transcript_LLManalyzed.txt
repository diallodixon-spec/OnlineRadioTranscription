20260101 125627 I thought I was stronger How could I know, how could I know I can't take this much longer So hard on my soul, baby, cause I'm missing you now And it's driving me crazy Don't know what I'm not doing The way I'm missing you now Maybe I just can't wait Till I see your face Chase away this loneliness
