20251219 131610 we've seen so much happen since the passage of Hurricane Melissa. We are doing our best to help our fellow Jamaicans in any possible way that we can. So through this brand, when you purchase a bottle at one of these pop-up location events, you buy a bottle for $500, $200 of that goes toward donations for charity for those who are helping with hurricane relief. But also we have a really nice special where when you buy three bottles, you're getting $1,200 for those three bottles. So you're getting a nice discount, plus we get to apply the value of that donation of each of those bottles you purchase towards charity, as well you get a chance to win additional prize on top of that. So that's what we call a sweetener. So persons can win baskets, they can win cups, they can win t-shirts, and you know, it's just a great afternoon to just chill out, prepare for the weekend, prepare for the upcoming holiday. So, definitely it's about enjoyment, it's about vibe, but it's also about making a positive difference, you know, for our fellow citizens.
