20251226 123224 I tell it to your eyes Love whenever you bring a vine With your hands them up in the sky Watch we drunk and having a time Carnival time again And we have all money to spend And we go right down to the end Watch me with me cannibal friend Them, beat, beat Things so sweet, sweet, sweet Feel complete, cause we love you back and y'all Hit, hit, rumble beat, beat Beat, beat, things so sweet Sweet, sweet, so sweet, so sweet. Feel complete, cause we love you back and now. Heat, heat, rumble beat, beat, beat. Things so sweet, sweet, sweet. Mm-hmm. Well, it must be cannibal. Love the way that you bring a vibe. We chance them up in the sky. Rolling back and having a time. Yeah, I'll be like him in the game.
