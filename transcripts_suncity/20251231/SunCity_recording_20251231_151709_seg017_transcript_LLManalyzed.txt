20251231 151709 What a way of traffic, rough on the roadside. Shout out to everybody in the traffic right now listening to Sun City. Just go on and take it easy. Hey, look at the bright side. It's your last day of traffic for 2025. Enjoy it while it lasts. You don't have to go through that traffic again for the rest of the year. This will be the last time you have to endure this horrible traffic for 2025. I was about to mix in another song but then I saw the message from doing over there in Canada saying Ali Pach, yeah man, pull up back that song, the plays and tanks. No problem my bro, big up yourself Zane.
