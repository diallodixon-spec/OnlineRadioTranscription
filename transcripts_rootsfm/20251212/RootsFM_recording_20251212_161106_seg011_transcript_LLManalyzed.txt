20251212 161106 Lord, I pray. I honor your name. Deliver your mercy. Whenever I fall, you lift me up. Glory to me. Oh god. Even when the plot and scheme and driver stop me. Stop me. Even when they try in your hands, my Lord. Yeah, yeah. Lord, I pray. I come to your name. I come to see a little of your mercy. You're all set up.
