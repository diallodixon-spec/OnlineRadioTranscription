20251217 142413 We build from love, we build from heart, strength from below and blessings start from west side flame to east side dream. Jamaica shining black, gold and green. Every test brings a lesson learned, every heart still burns. Hold firm, no retreat, that life did we so, so sweet Titan of light, we carry the flame No storm can wash away the name, from heaven's shore to world and song when the dark winds blow We plant again, we reap again
