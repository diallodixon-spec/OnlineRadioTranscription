20251229 132830 I remember times, my love Where we really had it all You were always there to make me smile And help me when I fall Ooh, I can't believe you're leaving me When there's so much more to say I can't let you go Ooh, every time I look at you I still can feel the glow Let it be, let it grow Ooh, love me, please Oh, just a little bit longer Together we can make it Our love is much too young to break it
