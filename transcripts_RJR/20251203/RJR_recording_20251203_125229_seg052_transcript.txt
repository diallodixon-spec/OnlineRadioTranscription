So you're asking me what I'm saying to think, for example, that small hoteliers who are affected, right, should be able to tap into funds. So you have smaller some attractions as well that might have been damaged, right? So those are the kinds of things. So, yes, that there is construction going on. But you know what one of the concerns I have too, that as we do the reconstruction or continuing of construction, we are extremely careful as to how and where we spend our money, right? Because we don't want anything constructed with inferior materials.
