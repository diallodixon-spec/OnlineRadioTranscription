20251216 160607 Just cry, true love's again We ain't letting it get in the stone Every night, I really need to just cry I'ma make you know our love be revived Bring it back and we gon' make it right Only dance, just trying to survive A part of me wants to leave you alone Part of me wants for you to come home Part of me says I'm living a lie And I'm better off without you Part of me says to think it through Part of me says, I'm over you Part of me done You do something and give me back love in you
