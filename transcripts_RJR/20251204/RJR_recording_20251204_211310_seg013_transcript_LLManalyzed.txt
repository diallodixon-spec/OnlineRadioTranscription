============================================================

You call me baby I know I'm not the only one You've been so unfathomable Now sadly I know why Your heart is unobtainable Even though, what knows can't lie You say I'm crazy Cause you don't think I know what you've done But when you call me baby I know I'm not the only one. I have loved you for many years.
