Under the mistletoe Everyone's gathering around the fire Chestnuts roasting like a hot chiller I should be chilling with my folks, I know I'mma be under the mistletoe Word on the streets and it's coming, I know you Rain gear's flying through the sky so high I should be making a list, I know I'ma be under the mistletoe the wise men followed the way I followed my heart and it led me to a miracle
