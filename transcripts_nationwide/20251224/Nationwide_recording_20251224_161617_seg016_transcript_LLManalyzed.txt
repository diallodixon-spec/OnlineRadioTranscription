20251224 161617 Watch Night Service at church or stay home? I don't think my home church is the 7 day event. I don't think we do anything much for New Year's Eve. I can't remember. I really can't remember. You have a service though on New Year's Eve? I can't remember, I don't know. Maybe because if I'm going to ring in the New Year at a church, I don't normally go to my home church so I normally find like a Sunday okay okay so I can't recall yeah youtubers let us know do Seventh Day Adventist churches do like watch night service or whatever they may call it I'm not sure I'm not sure let me see if there are any responses on Facebook
