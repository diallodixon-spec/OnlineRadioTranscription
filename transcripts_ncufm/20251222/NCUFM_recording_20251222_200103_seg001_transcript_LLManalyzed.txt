20251222 200103 Never pretty I tried to pick me up off the ground They said I wasn't gonna make it very far Looked in my life and I got so many scars Wasn't easy but I really worked hard Always having Father God in my heart Don't count me out yet I'm still running Called on by the God of fighting My eyes are on God's kingdom always And I would stop until I'm not where I'm supposed to be But I'm trying to be the man God wants me to be Don't let nobody distract me from my dreams Even if my friends turn my enemies
