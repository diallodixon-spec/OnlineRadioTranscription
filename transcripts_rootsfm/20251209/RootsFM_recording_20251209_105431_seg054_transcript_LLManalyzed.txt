============================================================

It could last forever in this love that we feel Sometimes your dreams seem like a perception to someone else If I ever forget to hold your hand Always remember it doesn't mean I don't understand Which I love is our strength Together we're resilient And there is no other place to lay your head Never replace this love with anything you're loving
