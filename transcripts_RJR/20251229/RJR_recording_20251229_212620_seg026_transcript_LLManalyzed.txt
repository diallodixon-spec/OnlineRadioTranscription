20251229 212620 I've been hearing rumors about how you play around. Though I don't believe what I hear Still it gets me down If you ever should say goodbye It will be so lawful The angels will cry You'll never get to heaven if you break my heart So be very careful not to make us part You won't get to heaven if you break my heart
