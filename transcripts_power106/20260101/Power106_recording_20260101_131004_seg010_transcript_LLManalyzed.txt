20260101 131004 If I could, I'd spend it all again with you Like my first time on a ferris wheel The view from up here is so clear and real The sense of falling fast is all that I can feel And yet I want to keep on riding Now I see how lonely I have been What I have needed is a lover who's a friend I see your eyes and all I know is how to win the light of truth
