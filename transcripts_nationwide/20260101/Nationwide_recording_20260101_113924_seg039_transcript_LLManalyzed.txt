20260101 113924 Since I met you I've begun to feel so strange Every time I speak your name That's funny You say that you are so helpless too That you don't know what to do Each night I pray there will never come a day When you up and take your love away Say you feel the same way too And I wonder what it is I feel for you Could it be I'm falling in love with you baby
