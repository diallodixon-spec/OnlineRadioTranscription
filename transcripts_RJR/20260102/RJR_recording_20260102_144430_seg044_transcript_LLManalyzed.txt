Well, we started out, it was really, really funny because I had this little red kind of page boy hat coming out. And so Prodi goes, you know, everybody give it up for Josie. And I came out and he goes, that's not the right hat. You have to go change your hat. Okay. I said, okay, I'll be right back. And I came back and I put a little cowboy hat on last night and the crowd was like, yeah They went crazy and they were all singing that they all had their big time Everything about your name, you know, especially when he went into his part You know the the interaction on stage and the audience and the just the energy was so yeah The music itself is really really good. And so that alone yeah, man That alone will captivate the energy and create that vibe that Jamaicans love. And it's different, it's the first ragout country gospel. We like it! Let's take a break, we're gonna come back, we're gonna speak to Josie for a little bit more on the True Life crew. Normally we get people out of here at this time, Josie, but you know, we make our special guest stay after this.
