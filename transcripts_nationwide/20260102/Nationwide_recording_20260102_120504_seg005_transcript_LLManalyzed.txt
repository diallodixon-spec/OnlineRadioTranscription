20260102 120504 hit by similar hurricanes. And all the records show that Jamaica's performance is above its peer and very close to first world standards. The prime minister was speaking earlier on Friday at the Jamaica public service company's Hunts Bay station in Kingston. He was welcoming the arrival of additional equipment to further boost efforts to restore electricity in the most heavily impacted areas. More than 170 specialised vehicles were handed over, including bucket trucks, diggers, pole trailers and support units. It brings the specialised fleet to roughly 260. The equipment is intended to restore power to the 12% of JPS customers still without the supply since the hurricane. Prime Minister Holness used the opportunity to defend the government's decision to lend JPS 150 million US dollars.
