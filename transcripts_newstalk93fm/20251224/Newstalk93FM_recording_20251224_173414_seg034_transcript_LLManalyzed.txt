20251224 173414 Look at people in the street Chippin' down a lane It's how we break with the chain Come and taste our freedom, sweetie When you want your ways Look how you have in the places Hot and groovy Look what music could do it It's happy in the time again Feel like a movie When you throw it back on me I feel nauseous again Let me dance in like that Welcome to Joptown, baby. It's we at the Joptown, Jamin.
