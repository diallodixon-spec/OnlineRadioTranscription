20251212 194429 first for Cliffhanger in 1985 and again rebirth in 2012. Jimmy Cliff has taken his final bow, but his voice will continue to echo in dance halls and churches and quiet moments of reflection. His life reminds us that Jamaica's creativity is indeed world-class and that our stories told in our language, our rhythm, are powerful enough to move the world.
