20251231 193519 We like the gift of life. Walk away from trouble. Stay away from strife. Life is to live to the best in life. You only live once. You're not live twice, yo. Follow the road on the righteous path. Still focus and can't just put you in your tatters. Don't make the wicked, them corrupt your heart. Do the right thing, become the one. Yes, yes, all. Take away yourself from trouble, from trouble. Rebuilding Jamaica. Children live what they learn. What are you teaching the children?
