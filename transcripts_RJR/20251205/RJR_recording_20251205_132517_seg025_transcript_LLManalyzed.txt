This kiss is credit in the back of love. I never leave home without it. He is different from anyone I know, but he's so great. Bedroom eyes head back to the side, please don't whistle me. Forcing heaven love you, I'll match you love with miles. We make love, darling, forever. From the bottom, I love you. I believe you'll never. I got to, got to tell you, darling. Ooh, baby, I think I love you From head to toe Ooh, baby I want to kiss ya From head to toe
