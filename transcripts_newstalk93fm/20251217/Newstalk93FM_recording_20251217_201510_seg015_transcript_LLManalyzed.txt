20251217 201510 Can we talk some business, you know, I want your company and it's nothing too risky. Limited liability. Don't worry. If you try all the things I like, you could still be shy in the morning. So don't feel away. You don't like the fast life. But look on the bright side, girl. I go take the blame. I just want you to come it up Just a little wind it now Come and meet me at the end of the truck and we rev it up Say cool day, keep throwin' it back I know why you stopped us up Baby no way, we got most of all the pictures
