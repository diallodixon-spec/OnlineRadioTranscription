You know everybody talks about it in the media. You don't have to stop listening to hearsay. You ever experience that? Customs don't go into your package, suitcase, barrel or cargo unless you ship the item or the agent stand up right there when they're inspect it Listen customs job is to protect the borders collect revenue and to facilitate trade. They don't collect or store shipment. They inspect it and somebody has to present it for inspection. So how do customs ever get so much cost in them? Tracy, and the customs alone is involved in the clearance process, even though it's them we tend to talk about. Look at it this way, shipment delayed, talk to your airline agent. Missing items, talk to your freight forwarder. The charges surprise you now. Call customs.
