20251218 131813 Can you blow my mind? Set off my whole body If I give you my time Can you search my soul from here? I don't want to wait Don't take it Take me where I ain't been before. Can you blow my mind? Set off my whole body, whole body. Make me sweat, make me harder. Make me lose my breath, make me water Make me sweat, make me hotter Make me lose my breathe, make me water Hopefully, you can last all night Don't get too excited, yeah, yeah, yeah Ooh, privacy
