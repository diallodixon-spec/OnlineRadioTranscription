As we take you through this afternoon's edition of both sides of the story here on PAW 106 FM, we'll be playing just some of the many songs in the musical catalogue of one Jimmy Cliff. And as the Associated Press says, some songs about love, some about defiance, some about resilience, some about joy. This man has touched on so many different themes, emotions throughout his career. And we are all better off for his work. The whole world is better off for the work and the life of Jimmy Cliff we'll try to tell as much of the story as we can we can't tell all the story it's a it's it's too magnanimous
