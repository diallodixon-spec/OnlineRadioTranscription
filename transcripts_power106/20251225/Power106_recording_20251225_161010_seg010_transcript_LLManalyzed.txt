20251225 161010 Doesn't really feel like Christmas Oh, they flicker and they float And I'm up here holding on to those chandeliers of hope And like some drunken Elvis singer I go singing out of tune Saying how I always loved you, darling And I always will will But when you're still waiting for the snow to fall It doesn't really feel like Christmas at all Still waiting for snow to fall Doesn't really feel like Christmases at all
