Is there different opinions? Because certainly it's one of the things that we all have. We all share an opinion, but we can look at the whole thing and analyze it carefully and see what really and truly makes sense from what doesn't. It's now four minutes going up to, well, three minutes going up to 12 o'clock. Thanks to everyone who join us on the program today. Those of you who join us early in the piece on the social media space. Those of you would join us and the free to air channel, the 93.5 FM band. And indeed those of you who download our app and join us there online and so on. So all in all, it has been another very, very good day here and the Big 93 as we continue to broadcast live from here at UWI.
