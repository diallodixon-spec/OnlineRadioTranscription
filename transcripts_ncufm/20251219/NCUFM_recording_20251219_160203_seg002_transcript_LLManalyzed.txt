Thank you so much and soon time for you to pull up the handbrake, right? So, have a wonderful weekend, bro. Catch you on Monday. Auntie Sharon, always. God bless you all. Catch on Monday, bro. Hopefully by God's will, if it's you coming back on the air. And have a wonderful, blessed, happy Sabbath when it comes. Okay? Auntie Sharon, again.
