Because your voice might be the very thing that lifts their spirit. And if you're the one stooping under heaviness, hear this, God's word is for you. He says, Cast thy burden upon the Lord, and he shall sustain thee. He says, Come unto me, all who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. He says, My peace I give unto you. Heaviness may bend you low, but his word will lift you high. Receive it, speak it, share it, and watch how gladness begins to rise again.
