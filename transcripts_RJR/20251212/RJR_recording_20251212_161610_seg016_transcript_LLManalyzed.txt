20251212 161610 I'm gonna be all right. Got G-O-D all over my life. Don't worry where I've been, what I did, how I came on. Everything was a center till they changed. Don't worry about me. I'm gonna be alright. Got G-o-D. Take some more patience. No matter what, I'm not breaking. I'm not basic. Don't you soon,, you won't prevail I got up every time I failed, I failed But God's got me till the end Replace every horse with a win My last breath, get your strength All this pain, test your faith My last breath, give your strength All this hate,'s your fate If God is for me, who can be against me? He's all I need, all I need Don't worry about me, I'ma be alright
