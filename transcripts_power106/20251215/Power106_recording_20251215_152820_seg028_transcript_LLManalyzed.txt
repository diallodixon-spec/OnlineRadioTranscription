But to encourage my listeners, do not build on any land unless you have a title. Because if anything happens to this young man, that title really belongs to Uncle. Uncle could get up and sell that land and sell his house. Uncle could go and borrow money and market the house and don't pay the bank and it is sold, you know. They have lots of implications. They just don't go and build. Because, well, as I said before, this lady told me that when you get land, building, call you. So uncle gave him a piece of land and don't ask him a mansion, didn't call him and don't ask if he didn't answer. You know, I don't know what is wrong with us as a people. I wonder if you got building permission from the Portland Parish Council before putting up the mansion. I'm looking at the hills of Kingston and St. Catherine and going up St. Andrew and going up Red Hills. You know, when I was growing up, people have one room with ten children or people have ten rooms with one child.
