20251219 201710 carry on you light up my day and fill my night with song rolling at sea a drift on the waters could it be a drift on the waters? Could it be finally I'm turning for more? Finally a chance to say hey I love you. Never again to be all alone. You light up my life. You give me hope to carry on.
