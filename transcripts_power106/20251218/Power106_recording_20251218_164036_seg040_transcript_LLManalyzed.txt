20251218 164036 This is the land of my birth, I say this is the land of birth I say this is Jamaica, my Jamaica, the land of birth. I will never leave her shores, I will never run away. I will always believe in the black, the green, the gold, I say. All nations, great of all the tribes, we must face the test of time. Because our people, they are strong and we are going to get along. Though some people say we are poor, but the progress you make, my friend, is not always a ritual. I said this is the land of my birth. I said, this is the land my birth. I say, this is Jamaica, my Jamaica. The land of my birth!
