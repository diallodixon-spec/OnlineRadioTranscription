It's not just in Jamaica. I go abroad and I'm still doing a great job as a teacher. What's that like? I am happy. I am happy because this is what I wanted for myself. I wanted to show people that math is not hard. It's not as difficult as people perceive it to be. It's a way in which it can be delivered. That is the problem. And a lot of teachers that are teaching, they don't really understand the concept. They're teaching from a place of rote learning, and I don't do rote. I don't do jails. I teach conceptually. So students have to understand that the unit of conceptual understanding of the lesson, if they have that conceptual understanding, they will be able to apply themselves in whatever question they are given that is connected to what their learning is. You just said that one of the things you believe is that math is not hard. And you know a lot of us come into the math space with that mindset. Why?
