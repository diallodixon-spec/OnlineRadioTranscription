20260101 112512 Love, never knew what I was missing But I knew once we start kissing I found you Now you're gone, what am I gonna do? So empty in my heart My soul can't go on Go on without you My rainy days fade away When you come around please tell me baby Why you go so far away Why you go away Never knew what I was missing But I knew once we stalked each other
