20251226 161213 Where I'll never part from you I want you to be mine If I had your attention I'd tell you what I've learned In spite of good intentions It's easy to get burned I learned my lesson well It's you I need to tell This time I'm all for you I need for you to trust me To give you all my best I'll prove just what your love means Spoke me to the test This time I need to stay Don't need to go away I'm still in love with you Cross my broken heart boy Cross my broken heart for you I'm gonna stay this time Cause my broken heart boy Swear I'll never part from you I want you to be mine You're my morning sun You're my shining star You're my number one
