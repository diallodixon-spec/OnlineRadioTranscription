So baby, why won't you give me some TLC? And there is rumors going around, say when I'm out of town, there is a man where I'm supposed to be. Too late to be begging on your knees, and in my keys, and they go off me shut sleeve. You can go do as you please. You can go talk to John, Peter, or Steve. Because if love's so nice, tell me why it hurts so bad If love, love's so nice Tell me, tell me why I'm sad. Me sing again, I'm on the one for live a lonely life of that, I'm sure. But me nah go say comfy less when I know I deserve more. Every day from me vessel when me love, you come and pour, you come a pour it out, you pour it out. And when me ready for summer years, you lock me out and change your route and then you run your mouth.
