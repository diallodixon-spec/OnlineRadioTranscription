20251225 164120 You must know the truth, boy. I'm nothing without you. It's funny how I know what people mean, boy, when it's too good to be true. Because you give me joy, good love, good times, such happiness. Oh, yeah. And every day I thank the Lord for you. I feel so glad. I need for you to love me, love me, hold me, touch me, and deep in my soul. Never let go of the love we share, no one compares to you I'll never let you go Cause I really love you so, I love you
