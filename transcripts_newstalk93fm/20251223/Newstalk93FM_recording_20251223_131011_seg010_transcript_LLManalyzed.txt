20251223 131011 We need you back and we're high We need you back, back, back On to me, come on to me Come on to me, high, high Eternal place to go On to me, on to me, come on to me. Come on to me. This is my apology. Follow me. Come and see what you mean to all of me. You're a treasure in my eyes. The greatest pleasure in my life. Cause when you're living by the moon, honesty, hurry please. Home is where the heart should be. Pretty feathers in disguise. Not together we will rise. So don't you ever let me down.
