Yes, this is Zanny, Sandra Lewis. Are you hearing me? Yes, I'm hearing you. Okay, great. All right, welcome to the show. My name is Cliff Williams. Nice to meet you. And you are chairperson and director of the Domino's Association of Jamaica. I can tell you, Frankie, I'm a little bit surprised because this may be something historic where a lady is president of dominoes. Talk to us, Zadie. Well, it's always a good thing to see ladies rise, right? Oh, absolutely. I am a firm supporter of that.
