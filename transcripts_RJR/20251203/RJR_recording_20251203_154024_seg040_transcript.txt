You're going online. Not true. Yeah, man. You got online. Not true and it's okay to go online but if you have a budget every month and you say this is what I'm not spending more than this. Yes. It no matter if you see something where you love then take out something and put it in but but decide that this is where I'm going to keep. My online shopping or me go to road shopping. I eat at the cap, don't spend no more on that. I don't want to talk too loud but it's online shopping because every time I step into my house I see a new box. I am like the Grinch that stole online shopping. I put them all in a hide box for me. I step into the house and see a box I hide behind the wheel. I say, what is that? There's a new box there. I say, tree. Boom, boom, boom. Back to back box. Looking like a pyramid. So the one at the base. No, man. This is going too far now. Can you imagine? It's a good thing. UPS can drop a box
