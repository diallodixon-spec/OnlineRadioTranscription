20251216 151006 I am trying to stop you from your plan at all. Look at Bumper, are you ready to jam? Are you looking for a girl? Will you do what you want? So when you're ready, you can jam and follow your heart and never find out what girl will like it. And it's healthy to wind on everybody inside, yeah. Like yourself, like yourself, like yourself. So you can jump up and do your own thing, and go wind up and do what I like, yeah. And it feels good to wipe on everybody inside it. Like yourself. Like yourself. Until the party's done. Why don't you try to run the line? And you don't try to stop me vying party we don't have a plan
