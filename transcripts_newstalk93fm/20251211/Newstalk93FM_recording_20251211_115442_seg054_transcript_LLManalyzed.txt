I'm going to deal with the same rigor, all right? So let's get that straight. It's five minutes going up to 12 o'clock right here and the big 93 FM. Thanks to all of you for coming on. We appreciate every single person that take the time out to listen to this program, to make a phone call, and so on, we appreciate every single one of you. We love you as a matter of fact. You're the wind beneath our wings, all all right and to those of you who join me and assisting in moving the corn road OB the fireman YouTube channel forward I appreciate you just as much
