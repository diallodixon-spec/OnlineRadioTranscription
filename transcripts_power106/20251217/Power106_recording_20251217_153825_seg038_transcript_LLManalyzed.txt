If you don't threaten the police with the firearm but they find it on you and they don't kill you, is that a white man thing? No, no that's not a white man thing I don't want the police firearm is there. As a matter of fact, there was a video going around recently online, and I'm not taking this as any gospel, but there was a video out there of a stop, a traffic stop made, and the guy had to video, and he's alleging in that video that the police is planting a firearm.
