20260101 090002 Come to me And I will keep you warm Through the shadows of the night Let me touch you with my love I can make it feel so right And baby through the years Even when we're running grey I will love you more this day Cause you will always be the lady in my life Stay with me I want you to stay with me Don't just go nowhere Let me give you one My lady, my lady You'll be the sweetest girl in the world
