20260102 190508 the way I looked at it is that if I did something like that then I would be saying I did something wrong and the process was hijacked and I couldn't do that in fact you know I think one of the most fundamental cause I got was from my uncle who said to me boy Dennis you know I know that you have not done anything wrong and therefore you cannot give in. My uncle who is like in his eighties now, he said to me that one of the most important traits that your father taught you is integrity and to stick to things when things are bad. Did the appearance of Dr. Peter Philips, a former opposition leader, to support his colleagues in the opposition PNP, did that make things worse in terms of the spectacle that unfolded? Not for me, not from my perspective.
