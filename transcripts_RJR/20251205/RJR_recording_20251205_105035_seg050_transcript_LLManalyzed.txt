You mentioned that the Chinese ship docked this morning or yesterday for nine days and three ports have called Kingston, Falmouth and Monterey Bay. Now, and you mentioned about notifications have been sent out for people on the waiting list. Now, my concern is what I think, you know, the response for the people who you sent out out who is on the waiting list suppose most of them don't acknowledge that they received it and come the people in the clinic couldn't go to the port and stand by because you might send out 20 notifications and well the three people respond right so they would be there waiting for persons to reach out to their care
