20260101 101710 I can't remember when you weren't there When I didn't care for anyone but you I swear we've been through everything there is Can't imagine anything we've missed Can't imagine anything the two of us can't do Through the years, you've never let me down You've turned my life around The sweetest days I've found, I've found with you Through the years I've never been afraid I've loved the life we've made And I'm so glad I stayed Right here with you
