2025-12-12 11:38:09 I'm gonna put on my wig. And I'm gonna tell the story. I know you brought me on. To bring me in. You've been right there. You're bigger than me. You don't know. That you were there. When God slashed me out. Of the enemy's hand. You changed the enemy. You changed my world. I will change my talk. I'm a change my mind. I will save my life. I will hate nobody. I will do me like Jesus. I will nobody. I will love me like the Lord can't. So it bugs me how to take me in. He knows what's best for me. What's best for me in the end. I thought about something else. I always loved this when I didn't love myself. When I spent my time.
