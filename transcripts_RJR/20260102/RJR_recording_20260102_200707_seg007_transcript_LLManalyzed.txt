20260102 200707 After this I'm coming, coming Change your race So when you see me rockin' with my friends It's just a love, it's just a vibes on the ends And when you see me rocking by myself Telling me stuff I'll pretend so me tell them And when you see the liquor in me head You'll live me life like it's no problem And if anybody wants to fight with me Tell me you only love me then That's why I will never ever change I'm gonna be blessed every way I go
