20251222 181709 How can we be wrong? Sail away beneath To another world And we rely on each other From one lover to another I call you, I need you My heart's on fire Alipatch, my DJ Come to me, come to me wild and wild You come to me Give me everything I need So let's go Give me a lifetime of promises and a world of dreams. Speak the language of love like you know what it means.
