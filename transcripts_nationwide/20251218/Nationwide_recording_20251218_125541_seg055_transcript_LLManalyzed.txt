20251218 125541 Yes, good afternoon and thank you very much Jamal. And of course to the members of the news and production team back at Broadcasting House. Thank you all so much. And to the members of our YouTube community. Yeah, big up on yourself YouTubers. Yeah, you are all out in numbers. We're going to make way now for Oasis with Loy Gale. Tomorrow it's Friday, so Tyrone Reed will be here tomorrow. God willing, I'll see you back here on Monday morning at 10. You've just heard Cliff Hughes online on nationwide 90FM. Join Cliff Monday to Thursdays between 10 a.m. and 1 p.m. for Cliff Hughes online. My hands were steady. My eyes were clear and bright. My walk had purpose.
