Davin, give me a little chance to gather my thoughts. You're listening to Power 106 FM. The time is now... 11.16. Tracy? Hey, girl, what's up? So hold on. Why you look so vexed this early? The energy has stopped. Lisa, it is so good to see you. But sorry you catch me like this, girl. My uncle sent one by and when my family go for clarity, you don't want to hear the price of the people they put on it or something. But the matter is worse, I hear half of the things they're missing. And I don't see a customs. Girl, how you don't see customs? Lisa, stop going like you don't have any sense, man. You don't see everybody that talk about it in the media. You don't want to stop listening to hearsay, you ever experience that? Customs don't go into your package, suitcase, barrel or cargo unless you ship the item or the agent stand up right there when they inspect it. Listen, customs job is to protect the borders.
