20251231 211409 You with the sad heart Don't be disgusted when we lost it Heart don't take heart In a world full of people You can't go sad at all In the dark there's no inside you Make you feel so small But I see your true colors shine and bloom I see your true colours That's why I love you, so don't be afraid To let them show you your true colors, True colors are beautiful like a wind.
