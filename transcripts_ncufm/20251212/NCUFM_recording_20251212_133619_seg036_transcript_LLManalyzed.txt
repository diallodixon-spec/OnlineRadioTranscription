20251212 133619 Come rescue your friend Call him in the morning In the afternoon time Lay in the evening He'll be there When your heart is broken And you feel discouraged You can just remember that he's there. He'll be there. When not going to Jesus. Our sins are not our fault. No heaven and no wind come to rescue us. We're going to go to Jesus for things of good.
