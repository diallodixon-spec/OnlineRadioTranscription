I am this, I am this I am this I'm my ex with a new man He like a new girl He inside a session But he kickin' up hard And she put up shit to run Wind him back on demand They think I gave what? They're mad The day you leave me The day you me I started to see my way When your heart went, and went away What I thought was a tragedy was a blessing He didn't even believe it was a blessing, a blessing
