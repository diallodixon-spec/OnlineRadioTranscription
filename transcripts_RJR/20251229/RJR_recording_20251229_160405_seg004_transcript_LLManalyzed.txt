20251229 160405 This is a public service announcement from JPS. JPS is urging motorists to slow down when approaching JPS work sites, obey all warning signs and traffic instructions, and give crews the space they need to work safely. By doing so, motorists help protect lives and support the work being done to restore and maintain electricity across the island. Slow down. Move with care. Help everyone get home safely. JPS. Rebuilding together. Powering what matters. That was a public service announcement from JPS. Ladies and gentlemen, place your wallets in the upright position.
