20251217 161208 how much I love you. Can we make the fire burn again? Burn a little stronger. Cause I feel alone and maybe I'll keep being lonely when it's all gone. I don't want to live without your love. I don't wanna face the night alone. I could never make it through my life If I had to make it on my own I don't wanna love somebody else I don't wanna find somebody new I don't wanna live without your love I just wanna live my life with you. If I had to make it on my own, my life would never be the same. My love would never feel the same. I don't want to live without your love.
