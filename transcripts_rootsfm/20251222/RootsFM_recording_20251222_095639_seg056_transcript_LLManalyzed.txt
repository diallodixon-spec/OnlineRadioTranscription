20251222 095639 for me presents and cards on here my world is filled with tears and you oh baby this Christmas and as I look around your eyes don't shine the town they do. This Christmas, the fireside is pleasing by. We're caroling through the night. And this Christmas will be a very special Christmas for me. Oh, oh I love this time of year.
