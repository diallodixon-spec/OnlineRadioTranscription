check engine light is back on and now they're telling you you need a O2 sensor a catalytic converter not only that but maybe number that one of that number two cylinder is also damaged there's low compression on that cylinder now you need an engine or an engine repair or overhaul so yes it may be your mechanic you know figured out the source of the misfire but if you left for long periods running with the misfire, you could end up with a lot of other complications. Okay. All right, Kevin, we have to leave it here today. And that was a good point to end on because that is where I'd want it for us to pick up from next week. So I think we can continue on that and look at the other components that may be affected, right? And, you know, how to actually perform that thorough check or test and how to not further exacerbate any problem that may be underlined once it is that we're operating this modern technology.
