20260101 114025 They say I'm too out of control But there's too much action Somebody pour a nexon Until my head gone And I'm miserable All down on the ground I'm causing trouble Look how the security watch me They don't know about me I just mash up in place And I defect like a chumbe And don't wait They don't want about that. I just must have been placed under this threat like a chumbe. I don't wait. They don't want me in there, but I see that. They know I'm because I do. One way. They know I'll be in there. But I see that. I ain't gonna listen to nothing they say. Everybody's a chump jumping around.
