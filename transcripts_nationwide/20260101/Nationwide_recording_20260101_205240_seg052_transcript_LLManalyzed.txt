20260101 205240 Doesn't take much to make me happy And make me smile with glee Now and ever will I feel discouraged Cause our love's no mystery Demonstrating love and affection That you give so openly I like the way you make me feel about you, baby Want the whole wide world to see You got the best of my love Going in and out, changers!
