And I know we're meant to be My love will carry on So listen to my heart and heart And find out where my love will go With each and every line between us both Oh, babe, I love you so I love you I want you And you know my heart feels You're the one that I live for And I can't take it anymore I want you. You're the one that I live for. And I can't forget me When I called you late last night You see I was falling into love
