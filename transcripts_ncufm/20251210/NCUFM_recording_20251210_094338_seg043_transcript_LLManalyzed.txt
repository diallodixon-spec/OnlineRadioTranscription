He said no lack is in my life. Come on, sing. Everything I lost is now restored. Everything is restored. All of my past is in the past. It's all gone. So glad I don't have to look behind me no more. No more hurt, no more pain. Now I can lift my hands and say everything is changed for me. One more time, lift your hands and let's say it together. Come on. No lack is in my life.
