20251219 092322 the consumer hour this morning we have our friends from the Jamaica Public Service JPS who will join us at 930 we got lots of questions for them so I guess we will be able to answer well get answers to some of those questions when JPS joins us at 930 but in the meantime the phone lines are open for you if you have any matters, you can give us a call at the numbers to call 8 7 6 6 3 0 9 3 7 1 and that goes up to 4 and 6 1 8 6 7 3 0. Those are the numbers to call if you have any consumer related matters. Now is the time to call because once again at 9.30 we will be joined by the JPS. I just want to use this opportunity to firstly thank, as I call them, the road figures
