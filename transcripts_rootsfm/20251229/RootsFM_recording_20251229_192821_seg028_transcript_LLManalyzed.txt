20251229 192821 Love you so, even though you don't want me no more. And I'm crying tears, honey, through the years. I tell you like it is, honey, love me if you will. Hey, baby. I'm tired of being alone here by myself now. I tell you, I'm tired, baby. Tired of being all wrapped up late at night in my dreams. Nobody but you, baby. Sometimes I wonder if you love me like you say you do. You see, baby, I've been thinking about it, yeah. I've been wanting to get next to you, baby. You see, sometimes I fold my arms.
