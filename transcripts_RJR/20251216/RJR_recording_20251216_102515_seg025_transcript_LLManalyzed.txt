20251216 102515 Did the group, the H&L True Value Group, did you suffer any kind of injury or losses during the hurricane yourself? A little. Not very material, not as bad as it could have been. Even physical damage, we did suffer a little. Not as bad as it would have been. But all our people are safe. So we feel this is a very good pilot. It shows what a partnership like this is capable of doing. And I'm happy to say that Trans Jamaica seems to be quite happy with how we have serviced them so far. And I'm hoping this can translate to more similar projects where we can partner with institutions to distribute aid. You know, now we've seen that we don't need a store to distribute. I can distribute off a trailer. And that was a very good project to do firsthand and see it working. So I think that has been amazing.
