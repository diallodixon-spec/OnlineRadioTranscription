20251218 183021 collecting from a green license plate driver who was loading his car as a taxi. Wow. Wow. That's, that's, that's something. I am winning right now saying every three to four years, all drivers must go to driving class in person plus stop of laws on the books and don't apply them. And that's the issue. It's not being enforced. Gilbert is saying the government need to implement a 15-point system. Each ticket you get, you lose points. If you lose nine points, your license automatically suspended. But it's not the government who needs to implement such, you know, Gilbert because that law already exists with the demerit point system. It's just that it's not being enforced as it should be. Carlene Smith is saying prevent the selling of licenses at the depots. Begin driving lessons from upper form, upper forms in schools. Yeah, sounds doable Carlene. Jacqueline says even in the States license sell. Yeah.
