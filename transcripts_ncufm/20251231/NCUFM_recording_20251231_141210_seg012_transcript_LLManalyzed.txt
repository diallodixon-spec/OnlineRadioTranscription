20251231 141210 So as we drive together, I say welcome on board. There's a song, let me just jump into the song right now because it's an absolute wonderful thought as it relates to our 2025. Cary and Cheryl in sales is on this track. The track simply says he's been faithful. Oh wait, I must be like who come first place on them things now. Auntie Sharon, good afternoon to you. Yeah, man, you're the first person with a WhatsApp text message. Today, last day of 2025, God has seen us through. He has been faithful. We're hoping to see 2026, God's willing. She's sending shout-outs to the Drive Time family right across the world. Auntie Sharon, good afternoon to you. Special shout-outs. You're the first person to send me a WhatsApp text message today.
