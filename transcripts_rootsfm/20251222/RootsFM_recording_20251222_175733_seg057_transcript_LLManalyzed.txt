Them alone don't count off the mills. It's an authentic reggae beat. Let me skank off the shoes off of my feet. I'll get three feet a touch to Bob Marley And the little berries sound sweet You know you can't come take Mama Africa from we again You know you think you know can't come take Mama Africa from me again. You know, you can't come. You can't come. Mama Africa. Mama Africa.
