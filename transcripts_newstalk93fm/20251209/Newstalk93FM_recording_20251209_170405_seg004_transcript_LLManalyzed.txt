Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know about you but I come here to fight Come to play a mask I'm not leaving until I wet Come to play a mass I don't live my life with regrets, no I come to jam on a bumper, come to drink on a liquor Until my head's gone and I miss a rebel All down on the ground, I'm causing trouble Look how the security watch me, they don't know about this
