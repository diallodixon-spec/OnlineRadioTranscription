20251218 212013 They don't want me in there proceeding They don't want because I do one way They don't want in there proceeding I ain't gonna listen to nothing they say Every fat ass drunk Jumpin' up Doin' what I want Jumpin' up Tell them I ain't leaving Right, they are sleeping Every bit I drum Jumping up, Doing what I want, Jumping up, Tell them I ain't living Right, they're sleeping Until my head gone and I'm miserable All the money grown, I was in trouble Look how deep security watch me They don't know I'm out there I just must have been placed on a deep track like a zombie I don't wait, they don't want me in their party
