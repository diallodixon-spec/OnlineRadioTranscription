20251219 135533 enjoy a truly artistic experience. Come with us to the Potter's Fair. A small corner of the vast 200-acre Hope Botanical Gardens, the Jamaica Horticultural Society Showgrounds has been the home of the Potter's Fair since its move from the forestry department. What has survived the move is the consistency of the product, the caliber of experience, the energy on the fairgrounds. Amidst the throng of artists, artisans, collectors, enthusiastic buyers, and the merely curious, the buzz of the Potters' Fair, while distinctly felt, can be somewhat hard to describe. Patreon and former mental health specialist Anthony Allen describes his experience as spiritual. We see the passions of people. We see what comes out of their heart. It's really good to experience what's coming from love, the love that people have and from the gifts that they have. They're not afraid to use their gifts and to be confident in doing it, to give.
