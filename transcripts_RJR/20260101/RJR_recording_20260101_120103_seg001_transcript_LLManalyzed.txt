The security forces say they then came under heavy gunfire from armed men in the area. The police returned fire and a shootout followed. When the gunfire ended, two men were found suffering from gunshot wounds and were later pronounced dead. An AK-47 rifle was also recovered at the scene. After the shooting, it was discovered that Romaine and his grandmother had been injured during the exchange. Both were rushed to hospital where the child later died during surgery. His grandmother was treated and subsequently released. Following news of the child's death, residents mounted protests in the community, blocking roads and blaming the police and military for the boy's killing. The security forces have since cleared the road and are maintaining a strong presence in the area.
