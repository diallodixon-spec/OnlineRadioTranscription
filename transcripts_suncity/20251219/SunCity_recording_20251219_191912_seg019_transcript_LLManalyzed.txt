20251219 191912 We wish you a eerie eerie eerie Christmas. Old year and New Year's are just the same. Christmas on a broke pocket day.. Great tidings not the jade bring you. Great tidings, not the jade, bring you. Great tides not the jade. Bring you. And a dance all new years. We stank and rock it to the rhythm. We rock and we rock at the rhythm. We scrub and we rub and we dub wise And happy that's all We bring you a iry Christmas We bring you an iry Christmas
