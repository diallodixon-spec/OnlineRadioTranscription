20251230 144534 For instance, a 2024 American study found that thousands of indirect deaths following a severe storm can continue to occur up to 15 years after the event, with the figure being up to 300 times greater than official death counts. This underscores the importance of long-term health care in the aftermath of a hurricane, as well as the need for sustained efforts to address its health impacts. In the days and weeks following a hurricane's passage, the health impacts often shift. The immediate effects are apparent, such as physical injury from debris and other objects mobilized by wind or water, and drowning from storm surges and floodwaters. Other hazards include electrocution from downed power lines and exposed electrical wires and equipment, as well as carbon monoxide poisoning from exposure to running generators in enclosed spaces. Skin injuries can also occur following exposure to flood water contaminated with corrosive chemicals. Also, pregnant people who experience a hurricane are at an increased risk of preterm birth.
