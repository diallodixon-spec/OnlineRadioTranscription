I was about to say something but that would be very would have such a good comeback. Small. A trip to Miami is small. No, it's not small. A Trip to Miami? Jerome, a Trip to Miami is small? A Trip to Miami, I like to tom-tom that, man. Come on. How much do you have? I don't know if I have money. You know what? What's that $800, $700? I don't have money. That's not small. No man, that's small. Compared to, oh God, honeybee, man. My house asking for a trip to Florida. I don't have it. But if you give me a trip to Miami, I'll take it. That is one big trip. My passport is at home right now, wondering if I am dead or alive. Not to wonder if you are dead.
