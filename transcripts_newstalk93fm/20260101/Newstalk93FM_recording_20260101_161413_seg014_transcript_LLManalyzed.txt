20260101 161413 And it's nothing too risky, limited liability Don't worry, if you try all the things I like You could still be shy in the morning So don't feel away You don't like the fast life But look on the bright side, girl I go take the blame I just want you to and rise it up Just a little whine there now Come and meet me behind the truck and we rev it up The whole day Keep throwing it back at the way you stopped us Baby, no way We could boast of all the pictures you want When you're ready I could oversh, darling. You go over there. But we could meet in the middle and start a bacchanal. Play in the middle, hey. What we gonna do now? Jam to a rhythm, yeah. We hit a carnival. But we be heated. What we go do now? Start a wine on it. I say compromise on it.
