20251229 134930 I was speaking to Alan the entertainer from Trinidad while he was here. He was saying there's a lot, if you were in Trinidad right now, the brouhaha over the US, being there is quite a bit. It's saying you can't ignore it because everybody's talking about it. People trying to look at the radar and going down the street. It's all happening in the Caribbean right now. Yeah, and I think information is important. I think for some people in that region, you just hear about it in the news or you see it. When people don't know what is behind a decision or what is driving a decision, then you leave to guess, make assumptions and then that's what's causing all of them. The one thing I'm watching with all of this though is the carry come relationship. Oh lord. That's one that's very fragile right now. I'm gonna stay too good right now.
