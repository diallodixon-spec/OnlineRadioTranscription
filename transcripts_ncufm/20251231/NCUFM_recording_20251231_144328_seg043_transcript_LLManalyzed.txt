20251231 144328 We love each other when it's convenient. It is love as I, Jesus, have loved you. A love that is patient. A love that serves. A love that remains even when it is misunderstood or uninterpreted or not, oh man, not returned. Learning to love within God's family is a lifelong process. And we come from different backgrounds too. We come from different personalities, different upbringings, different life experiences, different morals, different values. So misunderstandings will happen in your family. Misunderstandings will happen in the church. Misunderstanding will happen in your community and in the family of God. Our expectations will clash. Feelings will get hurt. Yet it is in precisely in the family of God, our expectations will clash, feelings will get hurt. Yet it is precisely in these moments that Christian love is refined. It's precisely in those moments God has called us to love as He has loved.
