20251226 115431 We want to acknowledge your goodness today. Some, oh father, might be breathing their last breath in the year 2025. Some, Lord, would have been going through hell and do not know where to turn, but God, we have a hope in Jesus and Paul made it very clear that our hope is not dead, but our hope is alive because you god live and reign supreme and immortal and so we are thankful today that we can pause to acknowledge all that you have done for us and what you continue to do lord i pray today that you'll grant somebody peace oh god is going through a rough patch in their life that you'll bring back hope in somebody's life who have lost their loved one to the grave. Oh God, I pray that you'll open doors today and that you'll shut some doors that need to be shut therefore
