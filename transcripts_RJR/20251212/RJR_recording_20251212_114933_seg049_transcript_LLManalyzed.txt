2025-12-12 12:31:05 We're launching it today and it's all the wishes can be granted. Well, we will allow you to wish up until December 31st after which we'll make the the specific winners and announce them in the new year. Okay, so you'll draw the 31st or January? We will know the last day of the year. We are able to submit their wishes up to that time. We are going to do the draw in early January and select all the winners and invite them to come for the New Year start fresh for their wishes to be granted. How many wishes are you taking, by the way? That's the thing.
