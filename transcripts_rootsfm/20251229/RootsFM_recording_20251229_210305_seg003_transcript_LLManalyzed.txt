20251229 210305 As we walk along the shore Never felt like this before Now you're all I'm living for Suddenly Life has new meaning to me There's beauty up above and things we never take notice of. You wake up and suddenly you're in love. Each day I pray this love affair would last forever. Suddenly, life has new meaning.
