20251230 194432 Well, I just want to say that under the current leadership with the team work, Jamaica Draft is going to higher heights. We are setting new records. Our national tournament, we would have set some new records. It was actually the second largest supported draft tournament and coming off Melissa, that was a great achievement. The first crowning of our female national champion, first crowning of a youth national champion, the most youth that we have ever had involved in our national tournament. And we are looking forward to one of our biggest events next year, and that is the America Pool Checker Championships, where we are expecting to go back and dominate, and we want to carry one of the largest teams that we have ever carried. We do have the support of some sponsors for our national tournament. Some of the main sponsors being law offices of John and Joe McLeod.
