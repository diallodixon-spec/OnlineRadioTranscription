A history is going to be so important in knee pain as medical students third year just going to the hospital you don't know much and so whatever the patient tells you you write and so your history would have been pages and pages and pages and you're just writing everything he says from when he gets up in the morning to when he eat breakfast. It was so important because at the time, I wrote exactly what was happening to him. I wrote enough to have made a diagnosis, but never knew the diagnosis. The young man had knee pain in his right knee. He was holding on to his right knee, George. I I asked him he had no history of trauma at all nobody hit him never had an accident never fell nothing at all just woke up with this terrible knee pain he had a fever George one knee up had a fever
