funeral expenses are the first charges against an estate, because guess what happened? You have to be buried. And so that would be the first charge that would come out of the estate. So whoever pays the funeral expense can always claim that back. And then, so we settle the liabilities. And once the liabilities are settled, then we begin to distribute. So the adult beneficiaries in the estate, we will distribute to them. And then for the children who are under 18, we would give their guardian funds to take care of them. And taking care means we buy their books for school, we pay their school fees, We provide money for maintenance for them. And then when they are 18, we would then transfer their assets to them. So we don't wait until they're 18 for the adults to get theirs. We would transfer to the adults.
