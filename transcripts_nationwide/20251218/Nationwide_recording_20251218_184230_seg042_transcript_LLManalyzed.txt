20251218 184230 in 10 years at the current rate of premium increases. We're seeing that in Jamaica. Our coastal developments are already threatened by increases in premiums. Some areas are simply becoming uninsurable because of the frequency of the events that we're facing. One of the world's leading risk assessors, Quotality, estimates Jamaica's insured losses are as high as 2.5 billion US dollars. It's a steep sum for insurers to absorb and there's already an expectation of premiums to increase to match the elevated risk. Minister Simuda says this risk has to form part of the ongoing discussions on climate change resilience. Resilience isn't just going to be thicker cement walls and slab roofs or restoration of a thousand hectares of mangroves that we foolishly degraded. It's going to have to be all sorts of financial tools to be able to prepare for a very different world and the insurance is going to be at the heart of that. It's why the government, I think in 2013, would have put in place particular coverage at a time where we really didn't have much fiscal space.
