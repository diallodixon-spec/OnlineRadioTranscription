============================================================

Go get a preacher, go get a singer Go put a diamond ring on her finger Be committed when you love Love, love, love, love Let them find out, let them find out Let them find out when you love Let them find out Take the time out and let them find out When you love And if you love them, why don't you tell them? Give them flowers while they can smell them. And let them find out.
