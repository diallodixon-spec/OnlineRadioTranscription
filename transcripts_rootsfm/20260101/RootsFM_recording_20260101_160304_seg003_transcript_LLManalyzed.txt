20260101 160304 Kaboom! One time! Kagbal pen! Toil! Mall road! See if you want to! One time! I love to see my people living in the house I like to see them fighting and swimming in blood Enough me get the farming, scorn in the mud Yet they wanna be the first to read the food as it born Oh, them fill the earth with peas and church and poor house Love the rum bar, yet them hate the pure house Them take the microchip and overwrought the poor out Less food, more chow more mouth, oh Rasta tell them all the wine Stop war and go till the sun Stop fighting for land and all Feed the coin, so many go defiant Slave master's feet in on them face They take the twitter smile, the ones at the door
