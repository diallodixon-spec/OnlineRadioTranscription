Yeah, somebody help me, yeah. And you may love the other way But we can't try to understand New York times up in the air Whether you're a brother or a wife or you're an auntie Stayin' alive, stayin' alive Feel the city breakin' and everybody shootin' And we're stayin' alive Stayin' alive Stayin' alive
