20251218 191719 If you look at section 10, subsection three, which speaks to what we call young man's defense, there is a defense for a person of 23 years old who is charged for the first time to show that they had reasonable cause to believe that the other person was over 16. So let us take, let us use this analogy. Two 15-year-olds have consensual sex. The 15-year-old boy believes the girl is over the age of 15. He has a defense. The girl, however, knows that the boy is 15 years old. She does not have a defense. And yet it concerns her effects. So he has a defense to the criminal, Chad, but she has no defense. And I hope you're getting what I'm suggesting is an absurdity. Yes. Some support from men.
