Remember to turn off the lights when you are leaving the house. The lights are for your enjoyment. You are leaving the space. Unplug the lights. You don't want a situation where something starts and nobody is there to see what's happening. Every room in your house except the kitchen should also have a smoke detector. An option to consider for purchase is a simple battery operated smoke detector which is relatively inexpensive. This smoke detector gives off about 90 decibels of noise which is loud loud enough to alert you in an emergency, even if you are in another room or if you are sleeping. Comes with a 9 volt battery, two side tape, you peel the tape off and you stick it in the center of the ceiling. Jamaica Fire Brigade, JFB Public
