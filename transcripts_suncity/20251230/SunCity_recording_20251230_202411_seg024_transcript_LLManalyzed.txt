20251230 202411 I don't have a secret for me, I just check it out. Mean with the something, with the something, I rap a piece of y'all, never settle for no scraps. Check it please, no, girl. We no easy figures, no need for trial. Body no outside, no range in the house. Tight, tight, when we ride the lead, no gap. No filter alone, make some gaps. Standards, no, you never drop. Never. Never tell a lie, we never lapse. In the riff raff. Check, check, check, check'all.
