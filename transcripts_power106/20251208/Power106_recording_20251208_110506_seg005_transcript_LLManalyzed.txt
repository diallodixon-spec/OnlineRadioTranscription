Yes, I'm taking on a very good ride of love Spinning, turning, floating on a kind of love Maybe it was the music, too much wine or something. Whatever it was made me make a big mistake and put papers on it. And whatever it is that breaks people up, broke us up. Now I'm breaking in some new love. I'm gone, baby.
