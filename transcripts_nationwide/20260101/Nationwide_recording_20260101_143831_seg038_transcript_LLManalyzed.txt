20260101 143831 In you I have no doubt This is what it's all about We've got the real thing, baby I need oh in my arms to charm and keep my warm Wanna be flowing on and on from dusk till dawn She's the one who keeps I calm when she's alone So be strong, do no wrong I need her in my arms to roam Just don't want her when she's ghost Be by your side, so brave and bold Or I'll be in full eye charge Lightning flash and turn the road
