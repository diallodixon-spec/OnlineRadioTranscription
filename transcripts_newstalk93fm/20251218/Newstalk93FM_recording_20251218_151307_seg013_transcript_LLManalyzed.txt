20251218 151307 I tell it to you, I love whenever you bring a vine With your hands them up in the sky Watch me drunk and having a time Carnival time again And we have all money to spend And we go right down to the end Watch me with me cannibal friend them, them me cannibal friend, friend, friend, yeah. Loud me cannibal friend, until we meet up again. We meet up, meet, meet, meet. Rumble beat, beat, beat. Things so sweet, sweet, sweet. Feel complete, cause we love you back there now. Beat, beat, rumble beat.
