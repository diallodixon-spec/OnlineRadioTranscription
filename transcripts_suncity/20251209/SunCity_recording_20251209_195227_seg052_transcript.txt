So just wait a little while On the little time I pray To the most high I pray The race is not for the swift My youth persevere Please don't forfeit It's not how you start It's how you finish my people Everything takes a little time So just wait a little while And a little time I pray to the most high But patience is the last thing on my mind And everything takes a little time
