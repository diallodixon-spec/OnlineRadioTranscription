So, by this time now, we're bringing the goat, then put the goat in the pen and he just draw for a book and a pencil and just start demonstrate to me. He write about a verse and a paragraph, two paragraph, and that was it. He was like, yeah man, this is the way you do it. And by doing that, he just put me on a part, like he just open up something to me right there, you know? It just put me right on a path. And from that, that was when I started to just writing, I started writing. By the time I left, this was like, say, 88 now, by the time I finished anchovy school, I had like two, three books of lyrics. That's very impressive. Yeah, and then, but this time now, you know, I'm about to leave Jamaica to go to the States because, you know, my mom, like, she's taking me to the States with her, so. Okay.
