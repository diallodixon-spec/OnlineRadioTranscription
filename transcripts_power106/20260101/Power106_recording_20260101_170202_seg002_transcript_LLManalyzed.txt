20260101 170202 Got to be a better way Got to find a better way My pocket is empty No money to buy And God knows I'm hungry Don't ask me back My guess is a system I'm hungry, don't desecrate I guess it's the system on working on me No, I'm just a victim of poverty Where there is life then there's hope, they say So I know that there'll be a better day All I gotta do's open just in the break of day And I know that my God will lead me
