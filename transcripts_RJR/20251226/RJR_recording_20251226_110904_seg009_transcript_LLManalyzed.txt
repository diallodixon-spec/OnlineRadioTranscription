20251226 110904 I'm full of shaving cream. Be nice and clean. Shave every day and you'll always look clean. My baby fell out of the window. I thought that her head would be split. But good luck was with her that morning. She fell in a barrel of shaving cream. Be nice and clean. Shave every day and you'll always be clean. My old lady died in her bathtub. She died from a terrible fit. In order to fulfill her wishes, she was buried in six feet of shit.
