20251226 144634 You're listening to Sleek Radio, 93 FM. A missile's all hung where you can't see Every couple tries to stop Rockin' around the Christmas tree Let the Christmas spirit ring Later we'll have some pumpkin pie And we'll do some caroling You will get a sentimental feeling when you hear our voices ringing. Let's be jolly. Take the homes with Brown and Harley. We're walking around the Christmas tree. Have a happy holiday.
