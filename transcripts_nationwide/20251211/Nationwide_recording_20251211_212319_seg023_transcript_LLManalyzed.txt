And if there's no business, they're asked to leave the premises. Should it be left, Principal Reed, to just the security guards to be doing this aftercare monitoring of the property and the children, or should there actually be aftercare personnel in place? I hear Tamara talking about costs, but I'm just putting that out there. Should there also have parents who do not partake, and the students sit and wait, or they play and wait, yes? So those few students, again, are under the guidance. You are able to see them from different areas of the campus.
