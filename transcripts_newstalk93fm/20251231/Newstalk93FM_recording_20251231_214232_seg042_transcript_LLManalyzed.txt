20251231 214232 I hope you're good, I hope you're well, I hope you live. I miss your touch, I miss your smell, I miss your looks. Maybe grab a drink, maybe grab some food, don't miss you. I know it's hard, but I don't have no glass. I have to protect my heart, I built the wall so tall I couldn't look over. I need to touch you. I need to see you. I'll take you one by five. I don't know why. And though you said not to call you, you will miss you And I hope I can see you one more day, will miss you Baby, baby, baby, baby
