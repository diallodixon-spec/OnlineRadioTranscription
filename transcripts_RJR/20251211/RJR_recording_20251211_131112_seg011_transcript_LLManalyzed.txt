I've got a chip on my shoulder with your name on it. So don't just stand there fooling if you don't want it. I say you're neither a lover, or you are a liar. So don't you push too hard, you're playing with fire Baby make your move, step across the line Touch me one more time, come on, dare me I wanna take you on, I know I can't lose I'm loving you If you just dare me
