20260101 144724 Kumbaya, burning desire Kumbaya, Kumbaya, you take me higher Kumbaya Kumbaya, unto you I cry Show me I know not the way Please show me I know not to wait Time will cut my blessings in No, I won't be ungrateful no time. Don't have everything in life I want, but my sun still shines. My sun still shines. For every day I'm alive, I'm anointed. Like the dream of the river that you planted. I was saved by your blood from the fountain. I have faith, and with faith you move mountains. The dreams are for the dreams
