20251219 090105 This song is for you. Just dance to it. Happy birthday to my friend Rikisha Johnson, many blessings on this special day and that's where we have to wrap it up Saeed. Happy new year to you all, not happy new year, I'm saying happy new year, but Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year to you all, you know where my mind is at. And of course, special thanks to our super producer, Michelle McCrae Smith. Michelle, welcome back. And of course to Turner Thomas in the newsroom, Kimon Thompson in the newsroom. And of course our sub-duper, what am I saying? Deputy executive producer, George Davis. The man behind the controls, of course.
