It was first established in 1788 and set to the melody of a traditional Scottish folk song. Although Byrne's version is the one we most recognize today, it wasn't entirely new. Early versions of the poem already existed and Byrne himself explained that his inspiration came from hearing an old man singing it. A reminder that the song already had a long life before it was ever written down. The phrase Auld Lang Syne itself is from the Scots language and roughly means for old times sake.
