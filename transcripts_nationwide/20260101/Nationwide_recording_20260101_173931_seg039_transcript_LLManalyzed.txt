20260101 173931 I can call you my baby boy You can call me your baby girl Maybe we can spend some time with me I know your plans won't holla cause I got them dollars pushed to make back Monday, Tuesday and Pala I switch whips like kicks, I'm a baller And if I get your phone number I'ma call you And we can meet up the next day and chill But I'm always on the road baby girl that's how I live I got bills to pay, I got moves to make But kind that'll keep a brother on his knees And I'm so curious After the club hangs down
