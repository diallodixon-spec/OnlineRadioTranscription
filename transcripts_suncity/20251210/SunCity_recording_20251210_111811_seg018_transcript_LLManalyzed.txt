============================================================

So many times I've said I've reached the end Trimmed the leopard time by the softness of your hands Lying to myself That I was over you But I found it's the hardest thing for me to do Sometimes I sit and wonder Why this life's so strange Sometimes I'm filled with the hunger But when I smile, everything changes I'm weak to you, baby No matter how you do me wrong I'm in love with you You're now tuned into the sisters.
