I think, all right. And let's continue with what I was saying. And I've been into a couple of places where I thought I was being detained by the immigration officers. No, I was not being detained.

Now, I'm a fan of Bob Marley, because I was around very much when he was around, and we absolutely loved his music.

And I've been to other places too where people want to know what is it about us as a nation.
