20260101 215440 Love can be so heartless when you turn out the lights A mutual surrender in the heat of the night Life's an empty picture when you're living alone Maybe that's the reason every heart needs a home This time I fall down, I get on my feet again I'm gonna win this battle in the end I'm gonna beat them at night Who can't get enough? I am willing to fight I'm a soldier of love Like a shot in the dark When the going gets rough When the going gets the speed of the heart You're a soldier of love
