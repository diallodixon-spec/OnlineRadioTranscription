20251215 151008 I have a line in spirit Early in the morning I had it Me cooler ready, me ice done ready Me punching that's automatic I have a lightning jumbie A kind of energy inside me And it ready for the rum Ready ready for the rum, ready ready for the rum ready for the action A spiritual encounter Killing me soul taking over Telling me to start off with drinking And do away with good behaviour So we out on the road now It's Mars and Riddy Man Soaker And are ready for the rum Ready, ready for the rum
