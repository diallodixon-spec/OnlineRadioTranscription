20251215 151914 Hey, what's your name? Hey, what's up with that? I give thanks and praise for what brings this place we live above us full. And no man can curse who got blessed in his real life from us full. I just say and I know I've been a man. I'm the greatest man in the nation. Might give my time to shine. No one can take it, take it. Take it away. Raise your hands up. Raise it to the sky. I am coming and my God is standing by my side. Hope is in my head, hope is in my head.
