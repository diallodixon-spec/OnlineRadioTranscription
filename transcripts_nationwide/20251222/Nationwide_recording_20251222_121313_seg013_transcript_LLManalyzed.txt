20251222 121313 Vaniti Maharaj says fear is rising among the country's citizens. As tensions escalate between Venezuela and the United States, Maharaj told Cliffviews Online earlier on Monday that many still have the hope that this thing will somehow end and it will stand off the end. And there was one Friday, for example, when there was a notice that went around that the army had called in all its members. Everybody left their jobs and their schools closed and there was panic in the highway. People just had to get to where they wanted to be. The thought of Maasai was going to land any minute. There are numerous people who are still stuck in case a war breaks out. And today we are particularly scared because a radar has been installed there with a temporary presence or ongoing presence of military personnel.
