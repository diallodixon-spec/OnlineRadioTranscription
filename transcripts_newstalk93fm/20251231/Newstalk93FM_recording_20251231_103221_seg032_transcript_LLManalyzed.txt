20251231 103221 I hope you're good. I hope you're well. I hope you look good. I miss your touch. I miss your smell. I miss your lips. You can grab a drink. Maybe grab some food. Don't miss you. Call my mama, baby. I know it's hard, but I don't have to go. I have to protect my heart. I built the wall so tall. I couldn't look over. I need to touch you. One more more time I'll take you one by five Now don't know why And though you said not to call you again when I miss you And I hope I can see you one more time when I miss you. Baby, baby, baby, baby. Ring, ring, ring, ring. Pick up the phone. Hello? Ring, ring. Ring, ring. Hello? Ring. Ring. Ring. Hello?
