In Manchester, flow and digital sites in Walderston were restored. In Clarendon, the McNee Primary School was restored. JPS remains on track to have supply of at least 95% of customers in Portland and St Mary by the first week of December. Restoration in Portland is complete except for inaccessible areas in Burnham Wood, Buff Bay Valley and the Balkaris Digital Site. And the company is also on track to restore at least 75% of customers in St. Anne, Manchester and Clarendon by next week. That's the second week of December. That's the last bit of update that we got this morning from the JPS. Alright.
