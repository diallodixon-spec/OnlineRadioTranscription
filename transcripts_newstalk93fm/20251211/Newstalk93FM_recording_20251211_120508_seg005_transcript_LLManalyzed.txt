So don't feel away You don't like the fast life But look on the bright side, girl I go take the blame I just want you come and rise it up Just a little reminder now Come and meet me at the end of the truck and we rev it up Say hold it, keep throwing it back I know why you stop baby no way We got most of all the pictures you want, when you're ready. I could overshare knowledge, you could overdo it. But we could meet in the middle and start our canals. Play in the middle, hey. What we gonna do now? Jam to our rhythm, yeah. We hit a carnival, we hit it. Hey, what we gonna do now? Start a wine on it, I say compromise on it Baby, spend time on it, I said compromise on it
