Can it be corrected? It is not serious, but I would still go ahead and correct it. Because when we have name inconsistencies on title, they can be inconvenient. They can create a headache, you know, documents may be rejected at the title's office. They may cause transactions to take longer than they really should. So even though it's not serious I would go ahead and correct it. We would do what's called an application to amend name and we would state perhaps that it was simply a typographical error. It doesn't matter whether it was your error or perhaps even the the error of the the title's office itself doesn't matter but yeah i could go ahead and get that corrected there is a registration fee i think sometimes depending on the error depending on how long it's been there the registration fee can range i think
