20251216 162617 Yeah We are another mentality Cause I'm in the mood to cry So I'm pickin' it up Pickin' it up In the middle of the night Cause I, I, I'm in the dark tonight So I wish we would never set the night alight Shoes on, get up in the moods of a real life rockin' new King Kong, kick the drum, rollin' on like a rolling stone Sing a song when I'm walkin' home, jump up to the top of the throne. Ding dong, call me on my phone, iced tea and a game of ping-pong. This is where you have it, can't hit a baseball, I'm ready. Life is sweet as honey, got this peach shade.
