20251212 192823 not so anymore. A lot of things not so anymore in this racing industry. Number four, Big Abbas, to be read by Hadi Dean, four days in the custom. Ran with a great deal of promise, you have to say, running for the first time. And was just a length behind the well-readened Tia Maria, that raised over six more longs. And running the mandatory test that he will get further than six seven uh tomorrow i think he'll get this job done the big threat should be number two senior biscotti dork is the rider for richard azzan this horse finished just about two length fifth in that same event so he was not all that far away but at the end of the race in fact it was just over a length behind this bigger bus and expecting these two to fight it out. Now horse number one Blythor to be ridden by Stedman, intern Stedman, he doesn't strike me the sort of horse that's going to be fully effective over seven for long but Stedman is smart enough
