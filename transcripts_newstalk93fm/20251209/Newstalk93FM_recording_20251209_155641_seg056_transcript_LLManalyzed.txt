So if you ever seem to lose your way, don't have no fear, hold my hand I'll be there girl, you know I care girl, cause it's love that we share I will steer it in the right direction, don't have no fear Hold my hand, I'll be there, girl, you know i care girl, cause I care All my love, all my heart, all of this is what you're getting girl from the start On the one, on the job, me never yet skip a beat, make it fall apart Sweet is love, but love is hard Sometimes you got to work on it right round the clock Never let it flop, never let it stop Give thanks for what we got Me tell you this girl, you know I care So if you ever seem to lose your way
