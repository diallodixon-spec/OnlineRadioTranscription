20251230 202311 That's when I need you to move. That's how I get right. Baby, if I'm safe in your arms, I feel safe. Safe like the money let it sit up in a bank. Safe like a car with the alarm. I feel safe. My body got right by my side, so I don't need a rich to somebody that can make me feel safe. Yeah, look, I don't want a couple, but nobody ever made me feel like you. Facts. Because when I'm with you, I just know I'm fine. Know I'm fine. You take all the pressure off my mind. All the time. Patience and time will not be going out my mind. Say from the problems, I don't worry because I'm hard to find. Safe, safe, safe. What a fun!
