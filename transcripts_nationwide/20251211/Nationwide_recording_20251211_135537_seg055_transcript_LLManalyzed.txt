============================================================

I'll beat her class This is what I say Tired of taking the blame Might as well play the game Oh, sometimes it can be so unfair I'm longing to see you I wanna know how you've been doing over yonder I'm gonna catch this flight And when I reach my destination I hope you'll be smiling Longing to see me I thought you'd drop me a line Just to say hello my dear I'm doing fine Doesn't matter anyway now Cause my love for you will never change
