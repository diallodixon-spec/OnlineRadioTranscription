20251217 095123 is really the foundation of everything. So I hope this becomes the nucleus of our mentality, the word, the Zulu word, and I just hope that, you know, our brothers and sisters do their researches. But the reason why it is extremely important, because we need to have a start somewhere. As we spoke about a thing previously about our psychological condition as a people based on the trauma, post-traumatic states, and all of these things that we've been through. We still need to come together to have conversations like this with a good doctor and Mrs. Josephine and King of Bank and all this. We need to add this convert to keep because some people they have short term memory, you know, they will listen to the program and then I move on with the daily lives and just get caught up again continuously in the European way of life. And so it is so important to at least start to make the first step collectively as a race of empowering diverse, you know, youths to, you know, to tackle global issues, all kinds of stuff we have to do. So it's an honor to have a group like this for this conversation.
