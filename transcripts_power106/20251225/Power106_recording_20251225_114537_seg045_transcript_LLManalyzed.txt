20251225 114537 Hi, this is Teresa Rodriguez, Moody CEO of Jamaica Environment Trust. Season's greetings to all Jamaicans. As we celebrate with family and friends, let's also show love to our land, our rivers and our seas because a healthy environment supports every community. Wishing you 106 FM. Set a budget and stick to it. Christmas spending can add up quickly, especially on gifts and food. Setting a budget helps you manage your money wisely and avoid financial stress later. Try using cash or budgeting apps to keep track.
