2025-12-11 16:54:28 I love you and I won't be shy I'll tell you this month I'd like to hear it rise But watch, I love I think I'm gonna cry I will keep removing my girl, removing my girl If I can't see the angel in your eyes. Ooh, my girl. Grooving, my girl. Oh, oh. I can see your love light shine so bright. Love is a gamble, but it's hard.
