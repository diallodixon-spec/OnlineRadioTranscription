20251226 125637 That's what I plan to do Don't know why our love can't get together I never want to accept when you're not there I never needed one till I'm away from home I forgot to say I love you till I'm gone Now I pull in your driveway once more You smile and wait there at the door I give me one more chance and I'm blooming Maybe I am happy but I don't know, don't know
