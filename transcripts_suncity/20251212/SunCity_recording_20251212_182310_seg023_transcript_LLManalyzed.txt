20251212 182310 I couldn't do the same without you da You love is life-saving You always gets me when I fall There's people just like you and me who pass them in the traffic That never fall in love and some may have it seemin' lucky Enough of them, no fortunate, enough to have somebody Some just cannot see beyond the flesh and it's so funny Never get too caught up in yourself to feel the magic True love come unpossivin' life, it so tragic Opportunity is missed so take it while you have it No wait till you are panicked Well the last man here they would make a big mistake Left hand gone feel good and miss out something We're great liars and full of it when off of them a move fake Our things separate we can't separate cause I would miss you baby And I can't do without you, darling Yes, and I would miss you, baby Girl, you know I love you bad The days of the past Together we've grown Things fall apart
