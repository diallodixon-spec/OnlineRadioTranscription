20251224 182423 was conceived, and there were talks about it many years ago, but then it became a reality just a couple years ago when he was president. The brainchild of our first black international grandmaster, Grandmaster Maurice Ashley, who was born in Jamaica, left here 12 years old, became a grandmaster in the United States. And Dr. Nigel Clark, who was Minister of Finance, but also a chess officer rather, just like the most notable Andrew Holness, the Prime Minister. And the idea was Jamaica's not had a homegrown grandmaster, so we wanted to have our own grandmaster. And we decided to embark on this program, where for over a 10-year period, we would try to produce a grandmaster. So we would go through all corners of Jamaica, look at the talent, nurture that talent in a sustained environment, in a program, which is supervised by Mr. Ashley, Grandmaster Ashley, with a number of our local coaches.
