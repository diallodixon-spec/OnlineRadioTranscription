20251216 131915 Yeah, yeah I loved you with the fire in red Now it's turning blue in yourself Sorry like an angel, heaven let me be with you But I'm afraid It's too late to apologize It's too late I said it's too late to apologize It's too late It's like I missed a shot It's like I dropped the ball I'm sorry It's like I'm on stage And I forgot the words It's like building a new house with no roof and no doors It's like trying to propose and I ain't got the ring
