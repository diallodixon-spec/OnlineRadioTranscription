winds and rains, but for some, they brought unimaginable loss, homes destroyed, lives disrupted, and communities cut off from each other. For decades, the RGR Gleaner Communications Group has answered the call in times of crisis. Through the R.G. Cares Foundation, that spirit of compassion continues. We invite you to stand with us and support our brothers and sisters in need. Please donate bottled water, canned foods, other non-perishable items, and personal hygiene products. Items can be dropped off at our partner churches, Webster United, Hope United, Meadowbrook United, and Portmore United between 9 a.m. and 3 p.m. Mondays through Saturdays and at the Anglican Church of the Good Shepherd Constant Spring and St. Luke's Church Crossroads between the 730 a.m and 330 p.m Mondays through Wednesdays. We will make every effort to get donations
