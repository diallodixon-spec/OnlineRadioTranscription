20251231 134320 You're a big man now, that's how things go. Things they do to survive, only die. They're sleep-protecting us while watching us grow. You've been up, even when it's on the down-low. Work so hard to see us go to school. List us on your fingers so they can take us for food. I'm here for a purpose, I'm here to move. Most high job, that's the far I will see you through. Thank you, mama, for the nine months you carried me through. All those pain and suffering. No one knows the freshest end of your home. Sleep over my soul. Sleep over my soul. Over my soul.
