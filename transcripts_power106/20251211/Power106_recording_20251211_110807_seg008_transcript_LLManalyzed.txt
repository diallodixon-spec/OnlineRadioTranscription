Inefficiency, poor management, and when you're spending taxpayer money, you're not paying attention to it. But you know what bothers me most about this? Like most of, and this report, by the way, was tabled in the parliament on Tuesday. But of course, neither side will really talk about it, because both of them kind of guilty. But here's the lick. Like most of these reports from the Auditor General, what you ever see come out of them. Nobody gonna lose them work. Nobody gonna get fined. No, no problem at all. Business as usual in this movement. Nine? You're lucky if you reach nine. I remember when the man from the portal site, they sent in about three pensions. No, a little times. Yes. And the pension them large and big and whatnot. Big report from the Auditor General. Well, the man dead and gone and not now. Not now, not now.
