Todd's sharing with us as the public transport sector actually prepares itself for the Christmas holiday melee. So that's where we leave it today on Outer World. We want to thank you very much for joining us with The Back Tomorrow, bringing you more interesting facts from the automotive industry. So until then, I'm Shelen McLagan. at power 106 FM. Shop early. Stores get crowded and items sell out fast as Christmas approaches. Shopping early gives you better product choices and shorter lines. It also reduces last minute pressure and stress.
