20260101 184525 Good evening and welcome to Sportsworld. I'm Denise Walters. We kick things off with some football news. 1-0 victory of a promoted team, Treasure Beach FC, in the Rio Naveo-Jamaica Premier League at Stets on Thursday. Damoy Whitfield was the difference-maker for the Clarendon-based team, netting in the 63rd minute. They are now ninth in the standings on 15 points. Head coach of Chapleton Maroons, Donovan Dookie, believes they have finally had the result to match the performance. We came back due to games. We lost two consecutive games back to back, but I think we played well. The score line is not really a reflection of what we are doing. We are controlling games. We are creating chance.
