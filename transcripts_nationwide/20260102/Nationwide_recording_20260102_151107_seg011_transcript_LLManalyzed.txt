20260102 151107 It was a year full of a lot of stuff, you know what I mean? Healing stuff, shedding stuff and I'm just grateful that I was able to make it through that and to step into 2026 bolder and you know brighter and just giving thanks and just willing and ready to grab it by its horns and its reins and just to ride it to the very top of the hill. How are you? Well, I won't be riding anything to anywhere. But yeah, I am absolutely positively so excited that weird of a year 2025 has come to an end. trust and believe me i was just i'm so happy i hated 2025 oh you hated it matter of fact it's my third worst year of all time
