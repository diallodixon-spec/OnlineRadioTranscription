20251217 143232 You know the things I wanna do tonight Unusual Put it down, make it thicker with your piece of mind You gon' flow like water, we get it freeze up black Open your eyes and look Look what the hot body can do I hear the hot body come I see blue, blue, blue Focus Look what the hot body can do Body be dancing Snow white so my body so fine Drive past when I made a inside To want and I made a inside Make sense oh, make sense Hold my collar near the seasons Break glass ready for my distance Make sense, oh, make sense. Oh, my God, I need this distance. Make plans, I live for my distance. Make sense, so, make sense. Body, we look. Look what the whole body can do.
