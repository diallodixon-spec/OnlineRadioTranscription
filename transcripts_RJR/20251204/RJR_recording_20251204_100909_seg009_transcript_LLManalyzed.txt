Hello, this is the hotline morning. All right. Still having some challenges with the line. Sometimes I hear the callers, sometimes I don't. I'm not hearing you 2178 if you are hearing me. Let's try perhaps another number. 876-926. It's not any button that DT needs to press. Let us try 7615. That works. Hello, good morning. Hi, morning Miss Shields. Hi, who is this? It's Fidel, Miss Shields. It's been too long, Fidel. I know, I left Jamaica and after I lost the 2020 election, I took it to heart, you know. Oh, you took it to heart.
