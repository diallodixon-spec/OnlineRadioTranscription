Do you find that maybe one day upon one side, I want to know the next people said, you know, there's a lot of drama that happens, as we know, in a space and especially on TikTok. How do you deal with picking sides? Oh, like, for example, if a drama is going on, you have a disagreement. Yeah, like a friend of mine, I fight on this side or on the other side. Well, I'd like to believe that I always choose the right side but otherwise from that if we have different opinions we talk about the off year like for example I would say no you know say so and so shouldn't do this for true yeah and whatever whatever whatever and then if we do decide I I usually don't like to give my opinion and stuff because it's sometimes people take it the wrong way yeah but whenever i feel like i need to speak about something i do and yeah but usually we agree though that's the thing that's the thing now what kind of evil as a couple people
