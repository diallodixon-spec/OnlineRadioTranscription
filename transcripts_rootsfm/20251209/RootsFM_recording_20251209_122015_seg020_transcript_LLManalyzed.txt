the world, comfort, our preferences. We think that we can have it all, we can't. We are in danger of taming our faith, bending to the demands of our passions and the world's intents. Love requires a choice, a choice for the real, complete Jesus. It asks me and you to reject everything in us that is not Him. Our whole very much. Thank you.
