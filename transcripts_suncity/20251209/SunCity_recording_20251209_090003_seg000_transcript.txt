Same time, same place for another Sun City morning show. Up next is the Hello Jamaica team. But of course, y'all go ahead and enjoy the rest of your day. Take care of each other. Be kind to each other. Use your brains. All right? This is your girl Raven saying stay safe. And as always, crazy Dean. What good peeps. It is now 9 o'clock. Thank you for choosing Sun City Radio 104.9 FM, the radio with the difference. Tracy? Hey girl, what's up? So hold on. Why you look so vexed this early? The energy's hot. Lisa, it is so good to see you. But sorry you catch me like this, girl.
