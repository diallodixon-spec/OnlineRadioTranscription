20251215 102318 Now, Mr. Mullins, we will see a lot more persons being unable to afford certain basic amenities. I interacted with a lady in Westmoreland on my journey there, and she indicated that she's earning enough money to rent a place, but there's no place to rent. Oh dear, oh Lord, yes, yes rent. So whilst persons are not having financial challenges in terms of being able to afford to get somewhere to live, the availability and the opportunities are not there for them to get anywhere because it is almost 80% of the parish is devastated by damage to the infrastructure. And I went to Black River. It's just one supermarket that was operating in Black River, can you imagine?
