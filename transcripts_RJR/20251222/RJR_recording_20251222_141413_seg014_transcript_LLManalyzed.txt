20251222 141413 i see the scars i know the wounds still hurt i bet you're tired just trying to make things work you've had enough of battles you fight against your will keep showing up and one day i know you're bound to win when you've been so strong for so long and all you can do is hold on just when it seems like there's no way Here comes a brighter day, here comes a brighter day Hurting so deep it's feeling like I need rum and wheat to feel alive Burned out and we can sleep deprived Oh God, please keep me through the night I'll cry for you tonight
