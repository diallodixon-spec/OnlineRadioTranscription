How does your brand focus on authenticity and the Jamaican culture? How do you incorporate that into the overall experience, would you say? Everything that we do is geared at the locals. So you will find us taking you to, for example, a river and you'll get riverside cooking. So we'll call ahead and make an arrangement with Miss Mavis or Miss Daphne or whosoever and they will prepare the food so you get that authentic experience and the money goes directly to the locals. So most of my tours that I have, that I create, it always filter using the locals. So they get that authentic Jamaican experience, they mix with the Jamaican people, they get to be on the road
