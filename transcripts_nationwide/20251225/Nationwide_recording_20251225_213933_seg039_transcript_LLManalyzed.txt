Many different flavors and the spice is strong You can't do the high stuff with me for a little song Baby let me show you how to do this You gotta know this You're doing fine There's nothing to it You gotta move this Come on and move this Shake that body Pump pump the jam, pump it up Why your feet are stumping? If the jam is pumping Look ahead the car to jumping Pump it up a little more Get the party going on the dance floor See cause that's where the party's at And you'll find out if you do that I would want a place to stay Can't you put it on the part tonight? Make my day I would want A place to stay
