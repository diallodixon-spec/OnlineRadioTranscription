reality of the human species. I am a father, my house gone, I want house. If it is a dog sit down and I have nothing at this stage, ask my brethren Farbs, if right now your house blow away, I can tell you, I can tell what happened to my relatives. He's in one of his houses, the breeze is shaking it and he says that he feels that there's an earthquake going on with the breeze that but he's just so powerful it is and he's about to run to go into another house that is at the back of the house and when he came out and looked that house is gone my brother actually took the pieces from three houses to build back one. You can't say to him now at this stage, My name is Tim. I want you to build a house that is resilient and menace proof. He doesn't care. He wants to go to bed in the night and sleep.
