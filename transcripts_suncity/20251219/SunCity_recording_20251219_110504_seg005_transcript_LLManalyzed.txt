20251219 110504 I can see the wickedness within their evil eyes Binging all so me just taste and lust chase Why dem terrorise the youth at night and day so? What make dem love the SLR and AK so? Make dem turn up like a sick lard and the youths dem waste so? Dem say we push always up earthy bone But we run always a surty sun Say dem love surty jugs and surty gun Just fill the club dem kill dirty sun Fire you see, I saw dem want earthy bone They wish to see the life journey done, see all the flourishing, they just see how burned it down. Smuggled something, they lie about it, push and swap, hurt the gun.
