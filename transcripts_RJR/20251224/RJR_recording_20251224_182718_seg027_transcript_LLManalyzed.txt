20251224 182718 Oh, holy night The stars are brightly shining It is a night Of the dear Savior's birth Long lay the world In sin and error pining Till he appeared And the soul felt his worth A thrill of hope The weary world rejoices For yonder breaks And new and glorious morn. Fall on your knees. Oh, hear the angels' voices. Oh, name.
