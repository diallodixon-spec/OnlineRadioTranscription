============================================================

the writing process. I mean, I feel like you should have ventured on this because me scared too. Oh god. Oh god. No, but what first thing you look for when you decide, alright, I'm going to write. Usually, it comes to me. It's it's it's some kind of inspiration. It's either one conversation or experience, one observation. I like people business. I watch humans. I'm a human watcher. I think humans are the silliest like the truth is always good enough, bad enough, funny enough, everything enough. Yeah. Yeah. So, it's the humans first to inspire me and then I have no holds barred approach to writing. What do you have to say? I have to say it. And you know some people try to look good in the story. No man, my loyalty lies with the story. Not with me or anybody else. So I don't care if I look bad in the story, I tell the story right. It has to tell good. I like that deal.
