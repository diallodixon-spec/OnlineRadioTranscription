20251215 090706 Good morning, I hope you are well. Full steam ahead soon. Sean Pang, good morning to you. Carole Burns is on the cruise. Good morning to you, Carol. Miss Annie's on the cruise, good morning Maxine Anderson. I didn't know you were on on Friday night, Maxine. Thank you. I was nervous. 34 degrees translates to how many degrees Celsius because I don't know. Sounds cold for Texas though. Stay warm. Claudette Periton's
