20251212 184628 Jacob Duffy was the pick of the Kiwi Bowlers with 5 for 38. Michael Ray supported with 3 for 45. Set 56 to win, New Zealand coasted to 57 for 1 to wrap up victory before T and take an unbeatable 1-0 lead in the three-match series. Devon Conway made an unbeaten 28 while Cain Williamson was left not out on 16. A disappointed chase reflected on the Caribbean side's performance. So we thought that we left some runs out there in the first innings and we thought that we would have gotten those runs in the second innings But it didn't happen so very disappointing for us after the bowlers really put up their hands and brought us back into the game But despite the defeat Chase says the team remains resolute to leave New Zealand with a win in the series
