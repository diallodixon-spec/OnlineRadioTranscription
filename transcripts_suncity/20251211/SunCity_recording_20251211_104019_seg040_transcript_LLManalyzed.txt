============================================================

I don't care what the enemy is trying to tell you. I don't care when he's trying to show you. I need somebody who determines. God, I believe's going to happen for me. I don't care how long it's going to take. It's going to happen. I came to encourage you tonight. Hold on to God's promises. Every word that he said, it's out. It's out. Come to me. Every part is out. We are here. And we're ready to adventure. It's out, come to me.
