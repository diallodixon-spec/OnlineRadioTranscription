20251222 191818 One of the things I always marvel at is that every time law enforcement cracks one egg, the scammers and the thieves just find another way. So you constantly have to try to be ahead of them. I've also noticed something, and I understand why it's necessary, but sometimes I get uncomfortable. When I see elderly folks at the ABM and they go into the the the machine and then they're in there for a little while and they come back out and they say could you come here and they call some stranger inside with them I don't like seeing it I understand why but yeah you shouldn't be that trusting of strangers if you can get somebody to go with you yeah like you know and who can help you, but you shouldn't just be calling a random person from the line to come into the machine with you. That's trouble. Absolutely. Not everybody's a thief, not saying that, but you don't know who he might be inviting in there with you.
