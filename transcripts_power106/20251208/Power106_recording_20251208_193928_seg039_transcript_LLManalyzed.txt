which is weird, what's that sport? Well, inline skating, when you're 17 or 18, you can cross over to speed skating in the Olympics, in the Winter Olympics, which is what Apollo Ono did, who was, at that time, became the greatest speed skater in American sport, in the US Olympic effort. That's nothing to do with him taking steroids. I never caught him doing anything. I'm not implying that Ohno did anything, but I'm just saying that this father was imprisoned and convicted for doing this with his son and had a six-year sentence in a Tampa Bay jail, and I interviewed him there. I interviewed his son, and the son was destroyed. His whole life has been recovering from the trauma of his dad using him for his own fame and gain. Now I don't want to I know we're wrapping up soon I want to mention a little bird told me that Cliff Williams is a big horse racingist through the ass.
