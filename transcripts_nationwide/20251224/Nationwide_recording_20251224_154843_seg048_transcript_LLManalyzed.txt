20251224 154843 I was away on business, and I came back, and I was always used to drive to Port Antonio through Manor Park, Junction, and Black Hill and that route. So I was in instant working, and I just came from it. I said, you know what, let me give this highway, the St. Thomas route, the coast road a look at. And you know, this hasn't been really functional for many, many years. Well, it's incredible. It's an easy drive. It's beautiful. There's one little section that's just being asphalted now, and it's under two hours from Kingston to San San. So I want to just promote that because people just think it's still under construction. But kudos to the powers that be. They it off and it's a different experience and i think that's going to be an absolute game changer for tourism and commerce in uh in portland so um if you're thinking of heading that don't bother with the junction take the harbor view
