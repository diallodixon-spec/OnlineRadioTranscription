What's up, guys? This is Terry Lennon playing the sumptop once again, requested by Shelly over there in Greater Portmore. Big Throne, originally done by the Queen of singing love songs. No, she's not the Queen of R&B and souls, but the Queen of love songs. Yeah, Celine Dion. Hey, shout out, shout out to G first. Got it locked in Stone Love Crew. Hey, G first. We need that jingle there.
