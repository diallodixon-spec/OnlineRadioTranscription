20260101 182818 I can help you spit on anybody ever hated Put you in baguettes, got you feeling like you made it Everything advanced, nothing that I do is basic Me and Rolls Royce on a first name basis Look her with no chases Only give her hunnits cause she hates seeing new faces Know she want her mind by the stones and her bracelet Little money, be a hot and down money She told me to pay for it now she backing it up used to date a Bob player But they wrapping it up got it in a penthouse and I'm smacking it up They gonna punch That's the difference when you're my baby That's how it is when you Nobody make me stop the world Go ahead, it's your time baby
