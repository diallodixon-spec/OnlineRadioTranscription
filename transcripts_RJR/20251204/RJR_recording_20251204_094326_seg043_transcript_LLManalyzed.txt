============================================================

even though the minister's paper had 2027, the crucial thing is the actual order. We need all of the latitude that we can get with the start of reconstruction that is necessary. So we don't need to be crammed into a corner to say we need to be back to meeting debt to GDP, getting it down to actually below 60 by 2028, which we've already amended, even though it is doable based on what the minister says in terms of the medium-term outlook for the economy is. So we're going through a bad patch now, but we are going to make the turn around the corner and we are going make it perhaps quite acute because of the things that are lined up. But we don't need to be sure change legislatively. And if it is just an error, I think we need to find out how this particular error occurred.
