20251230 205130 It's been a long time since I've been here. It's been a while since I've been to a place like call And we'll fall into love I'm the perfect mix of Saturday night and the rest of your life Anyone with a heart would agree It's so easy To fall in love with the way I do my hair, the way I make you laugh, the way we like to share a walk in Central Park. I could be fresh air, might be the girl of your dreams.
