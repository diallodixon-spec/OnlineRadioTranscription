20251225 144139 I just don't want to be lonely. And I don't care if it's a shame. Only lonely today. I just don't wanna be lonely. I've never been loved. I've needed to keep it on to give and learn I can't give up Keep it on, keep it on I just don't wanna be lonely Never enough Never enough And you'll never have to spend any more shit on me.
