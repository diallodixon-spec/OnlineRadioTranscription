20251224 191010 You're listening to Sleek Radio, 93 FM. It's heaven in my heart and we could find you some space. I could be the world to you, the missing piece, the extra sentimental kind of chemistry. Some people make it hard, but me that isn't the case. Cause I think it's so easy to fall in love. So come give me a call and we'll fall into us I'm the perfect mix of Saturday night and the rest of your life Anyone with a heart would agree
