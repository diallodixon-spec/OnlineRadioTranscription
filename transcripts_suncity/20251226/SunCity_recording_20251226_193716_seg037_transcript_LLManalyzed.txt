20251226 193716 Talk to me. Son, be careful. Don't make me cry. I don't want to pull my baby or wipe the tears from my eyes. Make me a proud mother. Let me see you grow to be a man. This is all I ask of you. I hope you understand. Talk to your sons. Talk to them. Reason with them. Oh, from my oldest to my youngest, I love you all. So all I ask of you is please stand tall.
