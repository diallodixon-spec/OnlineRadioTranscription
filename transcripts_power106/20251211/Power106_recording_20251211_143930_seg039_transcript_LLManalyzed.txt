============================================================

We're all alone and it's the moment all I'm waiting for I'm begging you, please say Please make my dreams Underneath the tree come true Don't forget my Christmas blue Cause there's only one wish on my list It's a kiss underneath the mistletoe Won't you make my holidays and I don't want to wait too long The mood is high, show me present Just one kiss and I'll be in heaven So if you would listen, there's only one thing I'm missing Please be still, please make my dreams come true
