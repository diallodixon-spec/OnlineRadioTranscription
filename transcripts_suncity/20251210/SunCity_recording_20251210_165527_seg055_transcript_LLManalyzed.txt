============================================================

I don't wanna wait in vain for your love From the very first time I blessed my eyes on you girl My heart says follow through But I know now that I'm way down on the night But the way things feel is fine So don't treat me like a puppet on the street Cause I know I can do my thing Don't talk to me if you think I'm dumb I wanna know when you're gonna see I don't wanna wait in vain
