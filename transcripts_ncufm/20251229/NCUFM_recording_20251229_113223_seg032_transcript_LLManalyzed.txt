20251229 113223 Sweeter, sweeter, sweeter as the days go by The moment he saved me His good grace he gave me He placed his love down deep in my heart There's great joy in knowing With him I am going Never more from him to depart Oh, it gets sweeter as the days go by. It gets sweeter as the moments fly. This love is richer, deeper, fuller, sweeter. Sweeter, sweeter, sweeter as the days go by
