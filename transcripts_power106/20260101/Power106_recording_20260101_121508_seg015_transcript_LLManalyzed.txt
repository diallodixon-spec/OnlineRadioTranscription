20260101 121508 Youth World Cup after the team was forced to innovate during their preparation for the tournament. The Windies are now 15 days away from their opening game of the tournament against Tanzania and head coach Rohan Nurse has explained that the team is ready for the championship despite the given the financial constraints that we are experiencing at the moment. We've adopted a slightly different model from the past where the majority of preparation work is being done in the Clare's local territories with the pathway colleges and franchises as well. And thus far that has helped us because obviously it would have played a major part in us having two series wins early in the year against Sri Lanka and against England. So we're quite happy with how that process is going and ultimately off the back of two very good series performances there is high hope in terms of what this team can achieve.
