Because one of them said, no, we're going to come out of town. And I said, it had hurt me to come out of a bus like that. Because they were so little. But trust me, they know what they are doing, but me will never allow my child to do that. It just ain't me aunt. But me know sometimes people have to do what them have to do, but it work out. You know, it sometimes don't work out. But we have to be more careful and and we have to be alert, conscious. I don't want easy feelings. I don't have easy feelings. And especially now with all this traffic on the road.
