20251212 131004 Now you take a sit up on me, I eat up Give me space, give me room, give me a little breeze now Jesus, Jesus How I make you feel, sir? Through me keep it, that me ever clean, sir Want me, did want ya, me never need ya This enough for people know, keep it on a deal, oh Me too young to lock down with nobody I pray one day somebody keep her company And a girl like me just wanna have fun and more money But you a pre-relationship and that's a no for me Why would a minor hit her on a knife right there? Ladies, link me. Terrible. Look at my brother super high.
