20251216 102520 With 2025 coming to an end, the JCF has been lauded for the significant reduction in murders for the year. It's on track to be the single largest percentage drop in Jamaicans killed since official records began. It's also the lowest murder tally in over three decades. According to Chief Communications Strategist, Senior Superintendent Dennis Brooks, the JCF intends to keep this momentum going into 2026. Last year, when the question was asked at the end of the year, we were looking at about an 80-90% reduction in murders. And the question was, is this sustainable? Because there's a good year. That was on the back of a good year, of a minus year.
