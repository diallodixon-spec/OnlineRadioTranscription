20251222 143427 Glory to be Oh God Our Redeemer saving grace I know I'm not worthy to see your face I try hard but I make mistakes You're still by my side every step that I take Through every heartache and you get the praise And you are my guide and my shield always Every time me I gaze and I play hard days you still show mercy and keep me safe Lord I pray I honor your name deliver your magnificence When you build a fence, it make all the difference
