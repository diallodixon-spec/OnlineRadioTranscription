20251229 190003 The world starts to shake and the world starts to spin. Can't let no break, lift it up, start again. Well consistent, from this you can depend. Love's quick on your hands. Let me know when you are feeling, feeling, feeling. Is this a dream? Am I awake? Moon on your your skin Hands round your waist Music is love And I heard you not play The way how you moving Got me feeling away Away, away In a while flexing you, you Call me like say you have the best in the truth Hot and sweet sky view No guessin' what me have to do to you Apply pressure till rain Open brain she knock on like mane A toothbrush to the brain And know me can't take it out for a stain So me know say you will feel it
