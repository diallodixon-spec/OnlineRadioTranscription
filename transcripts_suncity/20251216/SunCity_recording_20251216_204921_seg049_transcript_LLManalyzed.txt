20251216 204921 I lost the fight And I was so strong It's just not a losing game left my heart in pain Oh what a shame You see I want to have you back in my world You see I want you to be my number one girl, baby. We're gonna dance our way back to love. We're gonna get back to the spirit of love. One step forward, two step back. One to the left and the other to the right. And so we love, and so we love. And we dance all the way back to love.
