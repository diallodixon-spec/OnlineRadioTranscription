I did a difference. I put Dior Burton in the Balboa because we have in our computer to show us the sequence, the routine. The routine was Balboa, Joe, and Eric Nauda. This is the routine. So what I did, I put up Dior Burton, take Balboa, I took Teodor, take Joe, and I told my defense line, go up, forget Eric Inouye, don't think about him, because he cannot stay there, he'll be offside. So that's, we don't allow them to do what they usually do it, did against everybody. So that's strange. I remember a player... You're listening to Quora 106 FM. The time is now 6.30.
