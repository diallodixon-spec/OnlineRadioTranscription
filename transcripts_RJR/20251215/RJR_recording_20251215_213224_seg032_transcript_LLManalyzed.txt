20251215 213224 When you just cry and cry against your will I'll sing a lullaby to make you smile To brighten up your life I'll be your guiding star My darling, cross my heart I'll never leave you in the dark Oh, and I'll be your light At the top of the stairs You can make me down to sleep I'll be the answer to your prayers I'll love you till the desert has no sand Until the mighty sea covers all the land Until my body turns to dust again
