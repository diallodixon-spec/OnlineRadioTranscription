My uncle sent one by like when my family go for creative you don't want to hear the price of the people they put on or something. But matters are worse, I hear half of the things they missing and I don't sell customs. Girl, how you don't sell customs? Lisa stop going like you don't have any sense man. You don't see everybody that talk about it in the media? You don't want to stop listening to hearsay? You ever experience that? Customs don't go into your package, suitcase, barrel or cargo unless you will ship the item or the agent stand up right there when they are inspecting it. Listen, customs job is to protect the borders, collect revenue and facilitate trade. They don't collect or store shipment, they inspect it. And somebody often presents it for inspection. So how do customers ever get so much customer? Tracey, and the customers are known for having a clearance process, even though they are the ones we tend to talk about.
