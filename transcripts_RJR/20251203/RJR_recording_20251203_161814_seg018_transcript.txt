I love you For one minute I forgot you Sometimes things don't work out right You just have to say goodbye I hope to find someone to please you Someone who cares and never leaves you But if that someone ever hurts you You just might need a friend to turn to. And I'd do anything for you. I'll give you all. That's what I should do. Make you happy. I can pretend each time I see you that I don't care and I don't need you And though inside I feel like dying You know you'll never see me crying To ever think that I don't love you For one minute I forgot
