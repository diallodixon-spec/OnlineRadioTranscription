20251225 103121 Just a little winding up Come and meet me in the truck and we rev it up Whole day, keep throwing it back at the way you stop Baby, no way, we could post up all the pictures you want When you're ready, I go over here But we could meet in the middle and start a bacchanal Play in the middle, hey, what we gonna do now? Jam to a rhythm in the heat, I can't eval, but in the heat, hey What talk some business? You know I want your company. And it's nothing too risky. Limited liability. Don't worry. If you try all the things I like, you could still be shy in the morning. So don't feel away.
