20251223 143327 Are you carrying that Jesus is inviting you to bring to Him? Do I respond to Jesus' invitation quickly or do I hesitate? Why even is that? And what would it look like for us to truly rest in His presence today? Heavenly Father, thank you for inviting us to come as we are. We bring you our weariness, our worries and our burdens. Teach us to rest in your presence and to trust you as our faithful friend. Help us to lean on you more and more each and every day. Amen. And that's our daily devotion for the drive this afternoon. Daily devotion comes your way at 2.30.
