20251216 164335 today. But like the fans were out there waiting. What happened? To be honest, when I rewatched the video, I realized I didn't bleep out a lot of person's name that he mentioned. So to protect their brand, I mean, while I'm trying to protect mine, I can't be damaging other people's brand because of what he's saying. To protect their brand I had to re-edit and bleep out their name and their post. And also the subscription on Instagram. I saw it clear that you did not say right right that you know subscribe for the expose but a lot of people you know thought that assumed and they they just went ahead and just subscribed yes so what you got to say to those people um my sincere apologies but you can keep the subscription because good things are coming you can learn a lot of stuff over there oh you will be putting content on your your instagram subscription i'm going to make them subscribe
