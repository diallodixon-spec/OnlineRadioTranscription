Heaven and nature sing. Oh, oh, oh, oh. Let's go, let's go. And heaven, and, and, and sing, to the Savior? What has happened? What has happened to me? He's the sound of victory, the sound of victory. The Lord has been shot on the star, and the Savior is born. Heaven, heaven, heaven, Heaven and nature. In joy to the world, for the Saviour reigns and makes His blessings flow.
