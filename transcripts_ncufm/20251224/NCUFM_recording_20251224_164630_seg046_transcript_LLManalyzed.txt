20251224 164630 So I wake up early in the morning To give a thanks to a light of God To get my move on and put my shoes on Today I'm gonna give my all No complaining, God is moving He controls all my life What brand-new day, I'm walking in my purpose. I've got a message for my distressors, the U.I.A. doctor.
