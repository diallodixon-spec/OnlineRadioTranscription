Put it down, we got to carry your piece of mind. You go flow like water, we got to freeze up like, yeah. Open your eyes and look. Look what the hot body can do. I see blue, blue, blue. Focus. Look what the body can do. Body be dancing. Snow white, so my body so fine. Drive past like a mirror inside. To want and a mirror inside. Makes sense, oh, makes sense. Hold my color near the seasons. Fragrance, I live for my instincts. Makes sense, so, makes sense. Buddy, look. Look what the old buddy can do. I said, baby, look.
