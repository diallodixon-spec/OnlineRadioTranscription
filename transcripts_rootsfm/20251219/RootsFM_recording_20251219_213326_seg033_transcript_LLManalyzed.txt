20251219 213326 i know you're weary i know your plans don't include me still here we are both of us lonely longing for shelter from all that we see why should we worry no one one will care, girl. Look at the stars now, so far away. We've got tonight. Who needs tomorrow? We've got tonight, babe. Why don't you stay? Deep in my soul, I've been so lonely. All of my hopes bed in a way of love.
