20251222 172719 giving the people of St Elizabeth and Western Jamaica something to be happy for after such a crazy disaster. It is a very touching one for me because I and the players, we were in the dam together throughout the storm. We never move a muscle. And when the rooftops start to lift and run to the audit room, it makes me mind upset. No matter what is the situation, we're going to pull through. And this is a testimony to the hurricane that we got through. Definitely, definitely, we really, really want to dedicate this to the people of Santa Cruz, St. Elizabeth and western Jamaica and all the supporters of states all over the country because they have been very supportive of us wherever we go, whether at school or we travel abroad, we are always supported.
