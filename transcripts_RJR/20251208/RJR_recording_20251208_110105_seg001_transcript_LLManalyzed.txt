With the Christmas season on and the shopping activities there will be increased movement in the facility. With the drive now on to force transport operators to use the park, there is an urgent call for lights to be installed. The call has come against the background of reporting progress in the reduction of crime, with one less murder compared to the same period last year. Speaking with Radio Jamaica News, Superintendent Michael Campbell attributes this to revise the strategies, community engagement and social interventions. Superintendent Campbell says murders are not solely gang related but domestic issues have resulted in a number of murders. The police have also seized 16 prohibited weapons this year for four times the number confiscated during the same period.
