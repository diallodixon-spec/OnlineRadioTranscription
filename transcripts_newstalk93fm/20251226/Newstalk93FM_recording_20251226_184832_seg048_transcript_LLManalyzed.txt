20251226 184832 All I want for Christmas is you. You, baby. Oh, I won't ask for much this Christmas. I won't even wish for snow. And I'm just gonna keep on waiting. Oh, I need the mistletoe. I will make a list and send it to the North Pole for singing. I won't even stay awake to hear the magic rain display. Cause I just want you here tonight, holding on to me so tight. What more can I do? Baby, all I want for miss your time. What more can I do? Oh, baby, all I want for Christmas is you. You, baby. Oh, all the lights are shining so brightly everywhere.
