I can fall down on my face. So in everything, Lord, I give you praise. And that puts a smile on my face. Lord, I thank you for sunshine. Thank you for rain. Thank you for joy. Thank you for pain. It's a beautiful day, beautiful day. Beautiful day. Don't fuss and fight, let us unite We got more light, so let's keep fighting It's a beautiful day, it's a beautiful day So yeah, go a walk through the valleys of the shadows of death I will fear no evil won't be dismayed When I see the clock ticking away And things are not in place Everything in life happens for a reason
