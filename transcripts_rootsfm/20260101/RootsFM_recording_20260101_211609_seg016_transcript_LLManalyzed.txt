20260101 211609 And I hope it rains You're the perfect lullaby What kind of dream is this? Sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare Be the way I eat, the way you wake from the light Sweet dream, or a beautiful nightmare Somebody pinch me, your love's too good for me to be true My guilty pleasure, I ain't going nowhere Oh I'll wrap you around all of my thoughts Boy, you're my temporary life I wish to go your way, go the other way To wrap your arms around me for real And tell me to stay by my side
