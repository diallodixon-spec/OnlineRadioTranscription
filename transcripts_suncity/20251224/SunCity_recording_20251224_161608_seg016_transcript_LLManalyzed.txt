20251224 161608 Hey, shout out to Son Mini, got it locked in, kids are taught cruel. I like sending you to the back of the class and sending you to the principal. Don't change. I'm not complaining. Do you hear me complaining? You hear TJ complaining? You hear Muriel complaining? You hear John complaining? You hear DJ Spangy complaining? No man. Man, continue to stay bad man.
