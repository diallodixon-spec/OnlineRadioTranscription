============================================================

I put the family first Though sometimes it hurts So glad we're together here on earth. Never forget your advice and counsel, no. Mark one, Stacey. Love how you're taking care of your baby. That's just the way you're going, and I need to raise with you. Look how long you're telling them that we're gonna make it, yeah. And still we pray. Pray.
