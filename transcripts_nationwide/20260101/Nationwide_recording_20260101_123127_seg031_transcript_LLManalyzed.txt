20260101 123127 I don't have a choice Oh what I wouldn't get to have you lying by my side Right here Cause baby When you left I lost all part of me It's still so hard to believe Come back baby please Cause we belong together Who else am I gonna leave knowing times get rough Who's gonna talk to me when the phone to the sun comes up Who's gonna take your place Wait a minute, this is too deep I gotta change the station so I turn the dial Tryna catch a break and then I hear baby face I only think of you and it's breaking my heart
