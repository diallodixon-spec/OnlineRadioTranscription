20251231 194738 There's a fire, starting in my heart Reaching a fever pitch and it's bringing me out the dark Finally I can see you crystal clear Go ahead and set me out and I'll lay your wish bare See how I'll leave with every piece of you Don't underestimate the things that I will do There's a fire starting in my heart It's fire! They keep me thinking that we almost had it all The scars of your love, they leave me breathless I can't help feeling we could have had it all
