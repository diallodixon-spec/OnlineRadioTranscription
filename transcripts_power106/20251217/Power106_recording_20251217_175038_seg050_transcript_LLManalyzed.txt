20251217 175038 It's so good to talk to you again. It's been a long, long time. Can't explain why you cross my mind. I guess it's just to wish you a Merry Christmas. My best friend's having a party and everybody's going. I know it's gonna be a lot of fun. Oh, by the way, it's snowing. It's been a long, long time. And it's late while you cross my mind. I guess it's just too late. Gee whiz, it's Christmas.
