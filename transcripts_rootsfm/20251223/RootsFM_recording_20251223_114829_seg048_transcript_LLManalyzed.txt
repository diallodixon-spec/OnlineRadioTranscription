20251223 114829 We have fun. It's like a family reunion we're having. Plus, greetings are sent from foreign. Every belly full from Christmas Eve. And Grand Market we have to clean. Don't want no gun shot to go sin on the street. Put down blood shed broke with vibes. No, oh, oh, no, oh, oh. Oh, yeah. A crime free Christmas time. No, let blood shed broken with vibes. No. Oh, oh, no. Oh, oh. Oh. Oh. Well, all I want for Christmas is to stay alive. Can't tell you how them of the 45. Well, I want for Christmas is a new brand ride with a thick Empress inside. Geez, no smoke, no fall, hunger, no liquor breeze. No one to stick up with gun and ball freeze. No brutal police to beat you till the week. Christmas can't catch me in a foreign country. Black lives matter in Jamaica too.
