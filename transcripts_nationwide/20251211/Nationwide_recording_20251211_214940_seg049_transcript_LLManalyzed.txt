2025-12-11 22:04:06 The application for an injunction barring the transfer was granted after concerns were raised in court that the lack of payment of millions of dollars of transfer taxes prior to the attempt to register the share transfer is unlawful. The concern was raised by lawyers for prominent businessman Adam Stewart. Adam is Butch Stewart's son and has a 52% stake in Gore-Stew. That stake was made possible by instructions in Butch Stewart's will, which mandated that Adam be given 52% controlling stake in his business empire. Butch Stewart died in 2021. The granting of the injunction barring the share transfer is the latest victory before the Supreme Court for Adam Stewart in his battle with members of his family for control of Butch Stewart's empire. Court documents reveal that a botched attempt was made recently to transfer the Gore-Stew shares into the names of executors, Attorney Trevor Patterson, Cheryl Hammersmith, along with Butch Stewart's former friends Hugh Vieira and Elizabeth Deneau.
