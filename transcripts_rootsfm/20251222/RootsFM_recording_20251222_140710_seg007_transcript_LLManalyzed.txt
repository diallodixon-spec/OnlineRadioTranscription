20251222 140710 So today I finally found the courage deep inside To walk right out to your door But my body can't move when I finally get you Like a thousand times before And without a word she ended me the better Well I hope it found a way into your heart It's that I hope you find the way into your heart. It's that I love you. This ain't love, it's truth. These new words, they could change your life forever. And our time you they will always be together. Till the end of time. Just the two of us here, till the end of time, yeah.
