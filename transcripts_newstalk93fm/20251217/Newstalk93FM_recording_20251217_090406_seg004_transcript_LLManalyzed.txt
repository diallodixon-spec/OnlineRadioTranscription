For one, it's difficult to accurately identify everyone who lives on less than $2.15 a day. And it's tough to know the precise needs of each of those people. Researchers at the Center for Effective Global Action at UC Berkeley offer an answer. They used AI to analyze how much people spend on things like food or shelter in about a dozen of the poorest countries. That allowed them to estimate that virtually ending extreme poverty would cost roughly $318 billion a year. That's about 0.3 percent of global GDP, a sum that is a bit more than was spent on foreign aid until recently, but roughly seven times less than what we spend on alcoholic beverages.
