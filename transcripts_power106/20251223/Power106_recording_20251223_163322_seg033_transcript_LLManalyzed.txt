So to have this conversation with us, Stacey Robinson, founder of the eCATS Mobile Classroom. Is it eCATS Stacey? Good afternoon. Yes, good afternoon to you as well and good afternoon to your listeners. How do you pronounce it? Yes, it's Yee Cat. That's my name in the reverse order. Oh, got it. Yeah, got it. That is smart. Yee Cat's mobile classroom. And then we also have Sandy Saunders, no stranger to us here at Power 106 FM. She's a marketing manager for Matthews and Clark Limited. Miss Sandy, Merry Christmas. How are you doing? Hi, Althea. Good afternoon. Good afternoon to the Power 106 team and good afternoon to your listeners. Good afternoon, Stacey. It is great to be back on air with you. All right. Good to have you both here.
