As parents, we are really happy for where they are right now in life and the opportunity that we had to raise them. We never started out thinking that they were going to be elite parents. My husband and I are both from, you know, background where we love sports. Him from Karate, coming out of the YMCA in Kingston, Jamaica. And I did track and field at Maura Bay High School, even broke a long jump record at Girls' Jams. And so my family has a good history of being in sports. And so it was really good to see them flourish in swimming. And it took a lot of hard work.
