Christmas tree was standing alone, waiting for someone to come by. One little Christmas tree that never had grown, cried as he looked up to the sky. Oh, please, Mr. Father Tree, the tallest of all, I'm so afraid and so alone could one little Christmas tree so tiny and small light up someone's home cause one little Christmas tree can light up a home so one little child can find a toy One little Christmas tree can light up a home So one little heart can find some joy
