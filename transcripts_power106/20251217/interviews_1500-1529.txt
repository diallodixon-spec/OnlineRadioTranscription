**Interview with Dr. Stefan Neal and Sonia Wyndon**

In a recent radio program, two interviews were conducted with medical professionals, Dr. Stefan Neal and Sonia Wyndon. 

Dr. Stefan Neal, Chief Medical Director at Critical Care Comprehensive Center, was interviewed by the host. Although the transcript does not provide the questions asked by the host, Dr. Neal's advice and information provided were appreciated by the host, who thanked him for his "great advice" and "lots of information for our men."

In another interview, Sonia Wyndon, a clinical psychologist from Tea House Therapy, discussed the mental and psychosocial aspects of the devastation left behind by Hurricane Melissa with the host, Katrina. Wyndon emphasized the importance of self-care and provided tips on how to manage stress and anxiety, such as deep breathing exercises, grounding techniques, and limiting exposure to hurricane information. She also highlighted the need for creating pockets of normalcy and connecting with others.

When asked about how to know when it's time to seek professional help, Wyndon replied, "If you notice that you're constantly feeling on edge with no breaks, so there's a constant feeling of hopelessness and overwhelm... and that it is starting to affect your daily functioning." She also mentioned that panic attacks, which can manifest as overwhelming physical experiences, such as a racing heart, difficulty breathing, and tingling sensations, can be a sign that professional help is needed.

Wyndon also addressed the question of how those who were not directly impacted by the hurricane can help affected persons who are struggling mentally. She suggested that presence, patience, understanding, and compassion can be a gift, and that validating the suffering of those affected can make a difference. Additionally, helping individuals access resources can also be beneficial.

Tea House Therapy, where Wyndon works, offers psychotherapy, counseling, grief counseling, and trauma care to help people build emotional resilience and thrive after traumatic events like hurricanes. Wyndon encouraged listeners to reach out to Tea House Therapy through their website or social media, or by calling their telephone number, 876-823-5897.

These interviews provided valuable insights and advice on managing stress, anxiety, and trauma, and highlighted the importance of self-care, social connection, and seeking professional help when needed.
