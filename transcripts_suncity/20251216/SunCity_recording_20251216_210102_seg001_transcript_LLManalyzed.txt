20251216 210102 It's Vaughn! And Twyla! And we're here with what you need to know this week, Wink! With a Y! Hey Twyla, I want to start off the show with a very special big up to an individual who truly deserves some special honor. No sir, this looks serious. Van didn't even start the show with him usual car and I enjoyed him. Plenty of times he left it on the show for that man, don't worry about that, everything good. Anyway, I need to put on my serious radio voice and say a special big up to Mr Sian Barnswell, Councillor for the Hays Division in Clarendon. Mr Barnswell, you're probably tired of hearing this now but you sir are a hero.
