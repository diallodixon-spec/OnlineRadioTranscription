And I've been in love a time or two. Still, nobody can love me like you. Nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody. You're nobody. Nobody, nobody but you. That's why I'm sorry. I love you when I catch you, girl. I love it when you do that thing, do that thing. I love it when i hold you girl, i love it when you make me scream, make me scream. Girl you know you hold it down, you know you're number one on my team, you're number one in my team. This is a shout out for my lady cause I'm number one on your team.
