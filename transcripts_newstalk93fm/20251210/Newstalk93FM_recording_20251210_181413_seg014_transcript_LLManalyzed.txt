Oh, oh, oh, oh The kind of girl that I dream about With just a little bit of attitude You're not easy And the whole world gonna know now My girl, show off, show off. Look everybody wanna come around. So girl you know how to lock it down. Whoa, one thing on my mind. My girl showoff, showoff. Now everybody are taking the room. Cause anyone you put me in the mood. So rude, so rude. Girl I want you to take off your shoes, put down the dancer. Take the charming baby. And why you show me your moves? Girl, how you bad, sir? Take the charming baby. I've been watching you long, long, long time now. Take the charming baby, and I want to hear you laugh, laugh, laugh all night long. Take the charming lady. Yo, yo, yo, yo.
