The mission continues to educate, empower, enlighten, and to encourage entrepreneurship. Welcome. My name is Jesse Blake. I'll be taking you through this afternoon's edition of Both Sides the story here on Paw106fm at the start of yet another traditional work week. Yes, Monday is the first day of work of the week for so many persons internationally, but that number or percentage of people that work the traditional Monday to Friday, nine to five, in a manner of speaking. That global percentage has dwindled quite considerably over the years. Definitely the start of yet another week of programming here on Paw106FM.
