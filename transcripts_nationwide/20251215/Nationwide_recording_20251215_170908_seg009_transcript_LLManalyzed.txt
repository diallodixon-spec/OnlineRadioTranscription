In 2017, the parish had recorded a lifetime high figure when 341 Jamaicans were slaughtered within its borders. For context, that figure represents half of the country's total murder tally so far this year. By 2024, that record high number had been cut by more than half, with 121 persons killed. Fast forward to two weeks before the end of 2025, and the figure is once again chalk and cheese when compared to 2024. As at December 11, 52 persons were killed in the parish. That's a near 60% reduction. This number is an extraordinary 84% reduction when compared to the peak tally recorded in 2017, less than 10 years ago.
