So, you know, we are here down at town, as I like to say, Spectrum Management Organization down here doing our outside broadcast. We'll be here until four o'clock.

So going back to Dr. Lee Kim Samaj, we started a bit on the coping skills, but I think it's critical, the coping skills. If I could just attach something to what she said. Sure.
