It's three years now, I'm trying to get my animal welfare company registered or the company's office, you know. And it's three years, I am trying to get my Institute of Corporate Governance and Data Protection registered, okay? So even if you want to register, where are you going? Because the company's office is, I am told, I don't want no license, nothing. I'm told some people do business with them, they have stopped taking apartments, they've stopped doing email, and they stop communicating. Why? What does that mean? One of the corporate people, corporate secretary people, she has to write a letter, give it to a bearer, the bearer hijacks somebody up at the company's office and let them write on the bottom of the letter what is the next step and give it to him. That's how she communicated that. You know what I mean?
