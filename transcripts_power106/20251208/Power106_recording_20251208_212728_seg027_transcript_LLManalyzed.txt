============================================================

They say in life you take a chance And in love there's no guarantees But the sweetest satisfaction comes from shaping our lives And turning down the walls of mystery What we share is special, is mystical. It's magic when I look in your eyes. Oh, but this is no illusion. I never want to lose you. So you'll be with me for the rest of my life. Oh, girl, I want your love. Love is the kind of love that you hold and pray for every day I'll pray for you every day You'll see your name's written here Written no more, darling girl That's all over
