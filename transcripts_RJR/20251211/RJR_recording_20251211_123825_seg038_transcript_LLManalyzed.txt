Couple weeks ago and as I just said that I'm trying to plan the trip to go back down to Westmoreland for the Christmas bonanza. Oh. And anyway tell me what you're asking. No I just wanted to ask you if you see anybody I use the kind of iron we used to use in the days gone by to press close. Self eater? No the one that they put on the fire because market there you have a whole lot of fire Self-eater? A pure bramble we could get. But then as a little boy, I don't know why, they expected us to find proper wood to make fire in. And to lift it up? Yeah. To chop it, because you had some log wood them days there. And the log wood was very, very tough.
