I heard somebody say Burn it, burn it, burn it Let's go and burn it Burn, burn, burn it Burn the marble down Burn it, burn It's going burning Burn it, burn Burn the marble down It's burning Satisfaction Came in a change of action Burning I'm trying to get a love They told him don't you ever come around here Don't wanna see your face, you better disappear The fires in their eyes and their words are really clear So feed it, just feed it
