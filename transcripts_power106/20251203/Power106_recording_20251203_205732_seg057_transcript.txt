You know, we need more time, but as we close, in the words of hope, do you, you know, as Jamaicans, is it that there's a light, you think, at the end of the tunnel? Or is it that we're just saying that there is a light at the end of tunnel? No, man, certainly, certainly. And the buzzword, the buzzword has been resilient, right? And I know we are Jamaicans. As a matter of fact, never in my 25 years living in this country have I seen such mobilization of just love and support, you know? People are just motivated to help each other. You see the love, you see the camaraderie, you see everything. And I just want to say publicly to, you know, persons out there, both in the affected areas and areas that doesn't seem to have been affected, just to know that, okay, we will rise. We will rise.
