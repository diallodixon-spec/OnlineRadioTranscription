20251226 190807 Baby, baby, why, oh, why, why did you leave me? And now you come and cry. I was looking in the floor, please, baby, when you left me and went your ways, girl. I know that you'd be sorry, but know you won't be begging me, cause I won't hear your plea, girl. I was the one who loved you, but you didn't hear, and now you've lost me. You've been only you talking to me Until the day that you've lost me
