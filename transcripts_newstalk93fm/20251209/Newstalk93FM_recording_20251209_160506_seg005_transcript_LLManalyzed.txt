We ain't goin' nowhere We ain't going nowhere Like we ain't leaving this place We ain't going away We not leaving this place Hey, anybody fix Tell them fly over We jammin' all on the shoulder. Y'all listening, moving closer. Send your bumper right over. Then drop it lower. Then walk it slower. Watch me in your review mirror. Go, go, go. Y'all, you are the greatest. You'll always be my favorite. No matter where we face it, don't't worry at all We go in places On all the biggest stages We on the road to greatness, gal In one, two, three, hey I don't need no traffic jam It need no traffic jam I don't need traffic jam
