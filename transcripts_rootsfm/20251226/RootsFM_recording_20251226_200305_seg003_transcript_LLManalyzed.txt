20251226 200305 I'll do anything, just please don't I don't understand it, what's come over me But I'm not gonna worry, no, not anymore Because when a man's in love, he's only got one story That's why my love is somewhere lost in your kiss When I'm lost and alone, it's you that I miss. With a love like yours, it's hard to resist. Oh, oh, oh, oh. Come on, let's sing this together. Any lover won't go back.
