20251212 161010 It's the drive on NCUFM. So watch out the Holy Spirit standing by so people have no fear And Jesus Christ has promised that he always will be there Just read your Bible, watch and pray cause it's a trying time And if you don't look out my friend, you could be left behind This train is getting closer now, I can see the light And a band of holy angels man, what a glorious sight The heavenly choir chanting out the song of victory And in the twinkling of an eye, time will cease to be but We're ready, we're ready, to sing this sweet refrain
