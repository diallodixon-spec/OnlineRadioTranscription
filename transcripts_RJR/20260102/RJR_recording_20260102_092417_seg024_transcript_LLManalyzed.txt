20260102 092417 moving on to Excelsior College and completing teacher training at the then Michael College, now Michael University. I never had the occasion personally of meeting Mrs. Markian, but from all accounts, she was an outstanding role model for journalists. And so that's why I want to single her out this morning and mention her legacy. Condolences, of course, to her son Sean and the rest of the family, friends and colleagues of this outstanding media veteran. May her soul rest in peace and light perpetual shine upon her. I have some other good news here. Congrats to Mr. Jeremy Taylor, King's Council. Although Jeremy is a KC, he did go to that institution.
