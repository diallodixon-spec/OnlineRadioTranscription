20251230 142620 Next year, next semester, which I start like what, next week? But God provided. I think I have enough. I mean, I must pay it off. It's going right to my school fee. I have enough, I can start. So hopefully by the time no exam must come in again, the end of that semester, I will have enough too. God is good, I tell you, I tell you, drive time family or daily devotion is next. Matthew did well with the daily devotions too. We kept them going, so stay tuned for that. It is NCUFM, transforming lives through education and wellness. Stay tuned for this one. We're talking about a family that grows together. Hey drive time family welcome on board the drive.
