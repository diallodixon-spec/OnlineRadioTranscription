If you give me, me, and I'm not gonna let go. Make you, give me, make girl my sample. Feeling's got me hitting on a freaking dance floor. Diallo, diallo. If I give you my love. Make you no disappointo. Me, me I got you from my door. Diallo, diallo, if I gave you my love. Make you no disappointo. So many people won't lick my skews, so baby chew, me can't serve your tools. And if I undo your two by two, you fit to scream, you can't lose in your food. So many reasons I'm in the stars, oh my god, yeah, the reason I do what I do. So baby, make you give me your love. Make you give me that love.
