So when you pick your minister from outside of parliament, all your ministers can be an independent person. The constitution says, okay, the minister of finance would not be tied by the government of any political party. He would be independent and he runs the finance ministry within an independent structure. That means the budget can be divided between the opposition, the allocation of funds can be divided between opposition and the government. But what you have is a one-side fit all. Whatever the minister say, it represents the government.
