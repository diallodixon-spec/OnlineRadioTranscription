20251231 102924 As we increase our financial education, we're gonna see that it is important for this tool to be part of our financial toolkit. And so we're gonna get that. And so one more message I have for persons who are either not yet planning for their pension or insufficiently providing for their pension. If you are self-employed, contractor, if you are outside of a formal corporate pension plan, you need to walk into a financial institution and take out an individual retirement pension plan for yourself. Love you enough to do that for you. It's not for anybody else. And remember, we can contribute as much as 20% of what we earn towards that plan. So whether it is a corporate plan or otherwise, 20%.
