============================================================

upon all of us, in particular those who profess godliness, righteousness. We pray that your spirit will dwell and abide with us, spirit of the Living God, fall afresh upon us tangibly, that we will bear the fruit of the Spirit, which is love, joy, peace, long-suffering, gentleness, goodness, temperance, self-control, faith. We pray that we will embrace these principles of the Bible and indeed be filled with your spirit and be obedient to your Spirit exhibiting the fruit of the Spirit. Thank you for being with us. Thank you for blessing us in studio, in radio line. Bless everyone who is listening this evening. Answer their prayers.
