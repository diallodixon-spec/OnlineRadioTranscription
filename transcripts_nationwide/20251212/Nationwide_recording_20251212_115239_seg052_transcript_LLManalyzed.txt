2025-12-12 12:16:01 tomorrow we'll be in Petersfield and Middle Quarters as well as we'll be at our Santa Cruz office and we'll be distributing at several other locations throughout St. Elizabeth, Manchester and then we'll also be doing the West in terms of St. James, Trelawny, West Milan, Hanover in general and I think St. Anne as well and Trelawny, sorry.
