We come over, make your body, body, body top Now I left me, I've been fall out Now I'm gon' tell no lie when we get you Like what make all your life Let's say you came in my life Bet we make sweet love tonight Ocean with the tides, can't do, me never pass Feelings of baby love, be my love And a shit of good comfort Got a girl who will make him come nigh but Never get a girl like me, me Listen yes my love, would you love Give me anything I want like one stop
