20251216 135331 When I'm away is like my songs always cause you're not near to hear me. If I lost my way, I'd know I'd be okay cause you'd be there to hear me. I know man, I can see things clearly. You genuine because you love sincerely. You never let me down, not even nearly, not even barely. Girl, know I love you bad Some to the laughter and some to the tears Some to the courage and some to the fear Some for themselves and they don't intend to share Some say I love and only pretend to care But enough of them are just mis-congeniality
