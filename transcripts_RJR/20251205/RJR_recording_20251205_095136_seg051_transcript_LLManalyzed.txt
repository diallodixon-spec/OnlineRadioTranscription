to change the roof you can go to metal roofing systems you know but but what is important is the connection of the roof to the walls and then the walls connected properly to the foundation so so so that is very very very important because this will help to resist wind and also you know we have flooding issues where you have to also drain the building away so yes the roof blow off but water also comes through the door bottom and all of that sort of stuff. So we have to make sure that the roof, the buildings, the ground is sloping away from your doors, et cetera. Also, it's very important that we use hurricane straps and anchors.
