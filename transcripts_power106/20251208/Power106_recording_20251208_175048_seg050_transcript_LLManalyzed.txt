Why you gotta be so good? Set your body ablaze, your body ablaze Me and you baby, set your body ablaze Baby won't you light my fire't worry your brain Don't you fret, just listen I'm saying Serious, be serious, I'm looking at my face I'm trying to take you back to my place Low on baby, just stick to my pace Box steady girl, so the rhythm and bass Come baby girl, we don't have no time to wait
