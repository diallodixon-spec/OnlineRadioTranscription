============================================================

I am blind, risking it all in a glance And how you got me blind is still a mystery I can't get you out of my head Don't care what is written in your history As long as you're here with me I don't care who you are, where you're from What you did, As long as you love me Every little thing that you have said and done Feel like it's deep within me Doesn't really matter if you love me
