The MID said both accused were pointed out by eyewitnesses in multiple identification parades. Constable Stewart, who was attached to the Spanish town police, and Constable Gordon, who was also attached to the counter-terrorism and organized crime investigation branch, Sea Talk, were fatally shot on the night of November 13 at their business place at 83 Lane of Waltham Park Road in St. Andrew. The police say the lawmen were engaged in a conversation with three men about them parking stolen motor vehicle in front of the premises when an altercation ensued. During the argument, it's alleged that one of the men pulled a firearm and fired several shots at the officers, hitting them in the upper body. The suspects fled the scene on foot. They later surrendered to the police. The police say the men are members of the Dusty City gang linked to a car-stealing ring operating within the corporate area.
