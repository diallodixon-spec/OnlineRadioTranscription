20251212 203733 and the organization are working hard to have our data protected. We have the Data Protection Act. So our information is indeed protected online. Not that we will have these persons who compromise it, but we have to trust the process sometimes. And as what you mentioned before, use the security measures to protect ourselves and our data. And know when not to give out information as well. So we have to be smart. So we can't have persons calling us via the telephone telling us that, oh, you have won such and such, give us your banking information. No, you have to make sure that these things are trustworthy and sometimes we are the person who actually get ourselves in trouble to be compromised aka scammed. I remember the first time that happened to me it was I left my card at a gas station.
