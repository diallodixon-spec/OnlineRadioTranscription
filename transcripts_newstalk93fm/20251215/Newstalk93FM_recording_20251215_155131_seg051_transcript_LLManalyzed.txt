20251215 155131 With so much energy Fill me with such melodies Oh, my sweet motivation When you speak to me, I hear a song Every word you say feels like a poem I will take you with me everywhere Listen to you every day Why are you my sweet inspiration? I never wanna say goodbye This love that I'm feeling gives me life On top of like a runaway train in the night I don't even wanna go to. I won't take a break. This symphony is so real. It's so real. When you speak to me, I hear a song.
