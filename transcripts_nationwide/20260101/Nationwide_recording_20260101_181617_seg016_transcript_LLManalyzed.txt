20260101 181617 I didn't get to sleep at all No, no I lay awake and watched until the morning light Washed away the darkness of the lonely night Oh, and last night I got to thinking maybe I, I, I Should call you up and just forget my foolish pride I heard your number ringing, I went cold inside And last night, I didn't get to sleep at all I know it's not my fault I did my best God knows this heart of mine could use a rest But more and more I find the dreams I left behind are somehow too real
