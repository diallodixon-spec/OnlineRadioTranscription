20251231 153721 My feelings when they swing like Django Lover. Feelings when they swing like Jango Lover. Now you crash your Ferrari for Lecky Bonner. I see what you've been made, could have been all over. My feelings today swing like Django lover. Feelings today swing like Timber Nick at you. Why you say I did nothing for you? If I do anything you want me to do the time, maybe another life, you will be my wife and we'll get it right. We on cast, last last, now everybody got your breakfast, have to say bye bye yo, bye bye yo, to the love of our life. My ayo, don't cry yo, and if it go ash, that yo.
