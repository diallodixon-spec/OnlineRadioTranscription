20260102 182311 Headed out of the party And I know you see me callin' But maybe you're with someone else tonight, you are not mine But maybe if you change your mind, no, I'll slide Cause you're only five minutes up the road And I don't think I'll make it home Cause I can't spend another night alone What does she have on me? What does she have for me? She doesn't have for me. I make it like she's mine. I need eternity. I need a savior.
