Can you think of a better situation where the law meets real life than the family mix-up involved when there is no will? This is a topic most people duck until it's too late. Intestacy. Who is really entitled to the deceased's estate? Which family member gets first dates to apply for a grant of administration? Can you challenge what the law says you should get? Or are you stuck with the intestacy chart like it or not? And how long does it really take to get a grant of administration in Jamaica. Balancing Justice host Andre Earl Casey examines family, fortune and fuss, navigating the law of intestacy. With a probate practice, powerhouses Madame Ingrid Cole and Gail English on Tuesday December 9 at 9 p.m. right here on Radio Jamaica
