My ex-husband is celebrating his birthday today. Ryan Prendergast got Tango from Tango Entertainment. Today is a big day because it's Tango's birthday. Tango's birthday! Real G, you know? Yes, man. Happy birthday, TMG! No, ex-husband. I joke, me and Mike, though, by the way. No, say ex-husband, because... Well, it's not current. So we can't work with the ex. Tango, me and myself. Alright, got to send birthday wishes to my friend Dana who lives in the Walton Park area all good wishes from the most high and it's coming from Marcia in Plum Lane right darling not too much crush you have no car singing melody you're gone but let me stick to the birthday
