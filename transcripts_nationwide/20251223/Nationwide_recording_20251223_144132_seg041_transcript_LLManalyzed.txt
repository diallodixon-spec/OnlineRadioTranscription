20251223 144132 Coconut and lime Be the ocean I dive into Be my afternoon delight Be my secret destination Baby be my, baby be my paradise Don't need no postcard, no souvenir I don't need to tell nobody, wish you were here Don't need no wristwatch to keep the time To tell the truth I like to just rewind And all I'll ever need Starts with you and me Be my sunshine girl
