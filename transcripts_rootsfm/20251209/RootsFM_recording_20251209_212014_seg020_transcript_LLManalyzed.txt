girl close your eyes let that rhythm get into you don't try to fight it There ain't nothing that you can do. Relax your mind. Lay back and groove with mine. You've got to feel that beat. And we can ride the boogie. Share that beat of love. I'm gonna rock with you. All night. Dance you into it. Sunlight. Gonna rock with you, all night. Gonna rock the night.
