Right. When the government made the call that we soon experience the hurricane and preparation was supposed to be done, we went full blast and decided to do what we have to do. We had to secure most of our buildings, the windows, no loose zinc or anything that could fly was left on property. So we try as much as possible to secure everything. We tried to clear because where our home is, we have a river running just right by the gate, actually within the property. So we cleared under the bridge all the trees and the debris that were there because we knew the water would surge so that the water could flow. Apart from that, we ensured we had enough tin food because we knew what would happen with the light.
