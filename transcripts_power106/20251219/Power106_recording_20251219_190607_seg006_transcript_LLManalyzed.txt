20251219 190607 welcoming visitors following the passage of Hurricane Melissa. Evidence of this recovery can be seen in the more than 300,000 visitors who arrived on the island within the first five weeks after the hurricane. Even after the passage of the hurricane, a vacation in Jamaica remains a bucket list item for many travelers. Tourism Minister Edmund Bartlett says the number includes both cruise and stopover visitors and is the start of a V-shaped recovery for Jamaica. Minister Bartlett notes that while some hotels remain closed, the current focus is on properties that are ready yet ready. But that should not be the defining moment. We are 71% ready across Jamaica with wonderful rooms. All our attractions are ready. All our airports are ready. So let us go there and celebrate the recovery of tourism and invite the world to come back here to make sure
