I am not saying, if you exude it to the police, I'm sorry. You should get killed. I'm sorry. Okay? Or you should be shot? If you have a gun, no. If I find with a gun on you, the police have no right to kill police. You're not a police officer when the police take you, you're gonna draw a gun? Yes. Are you even my son Jesse? I'm sorry. You gotta go. Okay? So I'm not taking up for bad men.
