When you take the chance on love you see It's not a waste of time if the truth can be The impossible can be So hold on tight if you think you're right Cause nothing hurts as bad as when you see you gave up too easily now i remember spending all my time on a dream that kept me wishing that you could be mine yeah and I was hoping there could one day be be a chance for me to get the love that I've been missing sometimes
