20251216 215736 I'm referring to the well-being of a country, because after all, all of us are servants of the Constitution. After all, the Constitution governs in a country. The Constitution reflects the ideas of us Jamaicans as a people. So tonight, you are in position of authority at whatever level, whatever sphere of influence, over wide, over deep. A job well done is not the accolades of men. Yes, someone should be able to do something positive about you. But a job well done is that with all the review of public, whenever in itself look, it will be said of your work that indeed, you did no damage. Though you were over all and God has blessed you with prominence, you acted fairly, you acted right, and you did the work to alleviate the suffering of many. May that be the record of heaven for your stewardship.
