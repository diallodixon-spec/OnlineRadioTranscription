20251216 202016 I'm Dianne Amelie, rhyming phenomenally, Islam Amid Ali, one or no apology, was an anti-BC, age of three, the greatest female MC, that needs to be quite unique, talent speak, politics speak with versatility, in me believe in no traffic, I believe that in the legal piece. Basement, frames, meters, homescales and stacks. When I did talking apparatus, instrumentals, and track. They want me to move my sativa load through them speaker bags. Play a small power sync fence, them a knock. Pusha kalak, we make it done so quickly. Pusha kala, we make the people, them a rock. Pusha kalok, come out a fucky vacillator Lift it from top and find your needle drop Who's a call that them never get the fee declares Who's a call at them chatting one bag of trash Who's a call off come out a fuckie vacillator
