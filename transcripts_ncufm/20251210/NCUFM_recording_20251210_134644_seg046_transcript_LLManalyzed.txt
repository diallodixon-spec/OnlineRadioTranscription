eastern tribes have apostatized. So let's look at what happened. Heavenly Fathers speak to our hearts now. We're listening in Jesus' name. So Joshua 22 verses 21 to 29, the western tribes come across and they are now having dialogue with the people of the east, the eastern tribes, the two and a half tribes in the east. Then the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh answered and said unto the heads of the thousands of Israel, The Lord God of gods, the Lord God of gods he knoweth and Israel he shall know if it be in rebellion or in transgression against the Lord. Save us not this day that we have built us an altar to turn from the following or from following the Lord or if to offer there on burnt offerings or meat offerings
