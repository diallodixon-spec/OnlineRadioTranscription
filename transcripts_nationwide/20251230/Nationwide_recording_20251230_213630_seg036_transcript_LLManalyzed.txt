20251230 213630 I really don't like cats. But that one cat? That's your neighbor's cat. But he comes to my house all the time. But to this day, it's still not your cat. Would I get a cat? No, I have a fish. Oh, and he'd eat the cat. The fish would eat him. The cat would eat him. That's something. You like the neighbor's cat, you got fish. But you would never get a cat. No wonder the cat is always always there because the cat wants to eat your fish. The cat doesn't even know where the fish is. Oh, the cat doesn't know where your fish is? No, no, no. The cat has never come inside. You know what the cat is turning you into though? What? A friend with benefits. Because it wants the fish. It wants the fish. The cat don't know where the fish. That's's what you think. The cat is a cat that just come and rub on you and looking for the fish. Good. So the benefit, the cat rub on you, because once the cat is rub on you, the cat wants something. The fish.
