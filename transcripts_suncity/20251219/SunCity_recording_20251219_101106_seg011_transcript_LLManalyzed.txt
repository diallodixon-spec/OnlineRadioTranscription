20251219 101106 Christmas. I wrapped it up on Sunday with a note saying I love you. I meant it. Now I know what a fool I've been. But if you kiss me now, I know you'd fool me again. Last Christmas, I gave you my heart. But the very next day, you gave it away You gave it away This year, to save me from tears I'll give it my heart, but the very next day you gave it away. Please, here to save me from tears, I'll give it to someone special, special. Oh. Oh.
