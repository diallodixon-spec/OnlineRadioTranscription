20251231 184721 What do you expect from me? Now should I stand in the middle of the road? Let something run over me So that I can get your full attention Wanna explain to you That all the hits are never recorded Gotta confess, yeah Just what you're doing to this lover You got my heart, my mind and my soul Hold burning with desire And if ever I was given a chance Every bone sucks, please Don't let me cry to you For a bone with pride is a sign of weakness But I wouldn't like you to know That you'd be just right for my people and skin I'd walk on my own, my own, maybe two inches For you, baby
