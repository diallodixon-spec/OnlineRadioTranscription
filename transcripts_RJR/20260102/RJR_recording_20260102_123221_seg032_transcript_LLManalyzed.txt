20260102 123221 calls reminding you of the feedback question. What's one thing that you can think of that Jamaicans must stop doing in 2026? And they must stop doing it now. Don't wait until next week. It's urgent and they must stop doing. I've been hearing a few from you. I want to hear from others. And also the thought for the day, progress, not perfection, is what moves life forward. Even a small step is still a step. This text from a listener. Morning Mr. Earl. Happy New Year sir to you and the Raider Jamaica family. Thank you. One thing Jamaicans must stop doing as of today is stop murdering their fellow citizens. Another one here about bad driving on the roads. Another one good morning to the staff of Raider Jamaica.
