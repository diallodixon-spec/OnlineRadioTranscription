20251223 203224 I tell it to you I love whenever you bring a vine With your hands them up in the sky Watch me drunk and having a time Carnival time again And we have all money to spend And we go right down to the end Watch me with me cannibal friend Them, them me cannibal meet, meet, meet. Rumble, beat, beat, beat. Things so sweet, sweet, sweet. Feel complete, cause we love you back and now. Beat, beat, rumble beat, beat, beat. Things so sweet, sweet, sweet. Well, it must be carnival. Love the way that you bring a vibe. We chance them up in the sky. Rolling back and having a time.
