20251223 211110 is Dr. The Honorable Lloyd Barnett, Walter Scott Kings Council, The Honorable Percival himself. Yes. BJ. And of more recent vintage, Mr. Andre Earl. You know what I'm saying? But I went to Calabar all age. That's where I took common entrance. And when they tease me, you know, the Rabalak people, I tell them, listen, I went to the original color bar. Yes. I am the best of both worlds if you want to put it that way. Alright. Listen, when I was a young lawyer, just a couple of months at the bar, I'm not going to call the names of the client but you might remember a headline and I know we are we have to be very careful with our words., so I choose my words carefully. The headline was Missing G-string leads to court. Front page. Any of you remember that headline? I don't remember that one at all. When did I remember that? Long before my time.
