20260101 172015 I didn't know you were my friend. Let's pray for love and a glorious day With the rising of the sun let's pray each day There's gotta be a place on this earth Where by peace mankind abides Let us find this place so every man can follow me Through my life I seek and pray that this place I will find Help me Lord as I speak to the world
