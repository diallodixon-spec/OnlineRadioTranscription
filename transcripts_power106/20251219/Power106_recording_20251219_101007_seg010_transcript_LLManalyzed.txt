20251219 101007 Good morning, Ralston. Good morning to all your listeners and I salute all the farmers, including our 5,000 coffee farmers across the length and breadth of Jamaica who are true heroes. And just to say, you know, it's a difficult time for all of us. And as I said at a ceremony on Wednesday, all hands on deck, let's get together and, you know, rebuild a resilient Jamaica. And for me, a resilient rural economy. I am on the side of batting for the development of a rural Jamaica, rural economy where 49% of our population reside. I agree with that, Donovan, and the way to do that mainly is through agriculture and making agriculture a more scientific, more rewarding process, not just this, you know, you give them a bag of fertilizer type of farming.
