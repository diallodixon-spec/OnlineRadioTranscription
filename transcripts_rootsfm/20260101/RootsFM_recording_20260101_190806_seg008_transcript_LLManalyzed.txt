20260101 190806 I've always been afraid that you would never come You're in my heart, but you're the only one, and yes, there are times when I hate you. But I don't complain, because I've been afraid that you would walk away. Oh, but now I don't hate you. I'm happy to say that I will be there at the end of the day I don't wanna be without you, babe I don't want a broken heart Don't wanna take a breath without you, baby I don't wanna play that part I know that I love you
