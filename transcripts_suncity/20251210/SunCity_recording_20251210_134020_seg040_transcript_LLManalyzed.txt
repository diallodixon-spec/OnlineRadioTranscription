============================================================

I got the sunshine, rivers and trees. Release the air. When the rain pitter-patter on the roof. Herb just a steamed pepper pot on the stew. Like it's a dream if you got gratitude. So go tell the regime they can't stop where we do now. Information you think on your own. Or else you're a slave to the things that you know. What do you know if you learn every day so be careful of things where you say Sending love to my friends and foes And I suppose I'm pleased To be chilling in the West Indies Just provide all my wants and needs I got the sunshine, rivers and trees Green leaves, green leaves
