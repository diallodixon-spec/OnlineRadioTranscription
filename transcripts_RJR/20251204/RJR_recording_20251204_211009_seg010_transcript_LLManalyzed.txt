============================================================

I can see your face, and I know right where I'm feeling Take me, make me, you know that I'll always be in love with you Right till the end So tonight, I'm gonna find a way to make it Without you, tonight I'm gonna find the way to make it without you Tonight I'm gonna find the way to make it Without you I'm gonna hold on to the times that we had tonight I'm gonna find way to make it, without you Anybody could have told you right from the start It's about to fall apart So rather than hold on to a broken dream or just hold on to love And I can find a way to make it Don't hold on too tight, I'll make it with you
