20251230 141009 Let me get my phone I need to call my baby and find out if she's at home Cause I'm feeling right I wanna be wrapped up in your arms tonight Alright, I wanna lay you down Make sweet love on the ground I got the balls! Don't wanna waste no time, wanna go home Said the rain is falling, my baby is all alone Don't want to waste no time, want to go home
