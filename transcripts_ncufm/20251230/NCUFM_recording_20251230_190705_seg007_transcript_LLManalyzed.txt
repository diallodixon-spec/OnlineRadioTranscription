20251230 190705 I tried to pick me up off the ground They said I wasn't gonna make it very far Look in my life and I got so many scars Wasn't easy but I really worked hard Always having Father God in my heart Don't count me out yet i'm still running fall down but i gotta fight it my eyes man God wants me to be. Only nobody distracts me from my dreams, even if my friends turn my eyes away.
