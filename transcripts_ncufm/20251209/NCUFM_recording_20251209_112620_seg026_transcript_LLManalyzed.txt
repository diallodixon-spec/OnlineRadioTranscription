Birthday greetings to my beautiful princess Yolanda Henry over there in Lucky Hill, St. Mary. Hold on. God did not bring you this far to let you go. It will get better. This is coming from George Jarrett. Edna Witton, good morning to you. How have you been? I saw you sent a voice note. Let me listen. Edna Witton is giving God thanks and praise, as you should.
