20251218 101610 Is that something you would do hell no no I wouldn't do that when I go to restaurants I don't know I'm just so considerate so I guess I'll probably depending on the man I'm with then I sort of judge their pockets which I shouldn't do but I have done because mama B always used to cost me because I said that when I go out and people ask me if I want to drink a man asked me and I say I only drink champagne she's saying I'm a chest too high we can do that but that's what I drink I drink champagne But that was back in the day and now I don't really drink champagne like that. I'm just like easy vodka and cranberry something easy But then a big up principle. Is that principle music? No pan music on the life But yeah now I'm just easy but I do have consideration so I'm not gonna go crazy but if the person says order anything you want I'm gonna order anything I want on the menu but I'm not gonna take the mick and like order the most expensive thing but there's women
