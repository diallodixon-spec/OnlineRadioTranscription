But now you'd like to be my one and only love I said you'd like to my one and only But as long as I live like the sunshine Yes, I know that you just wouldn't be mine Oh no Oh no You should have known from the start That I would have break your heart Don't come knocking on my door no more Sorry to say but you're too late
