20251230 093724 I just did a quick Google search and all the reports I'm seeing are saying yes, JUTC did indicate that you will be able to check your balance online via the JUTC Smart Fare app which is being developed. I checked the Apple App Store, didn't check the Google Play Store, but I did not see a JUTC app and I'm sure if it was launched then we would have heard some fanfare around the launch of the new JUTC app. Now, questions then now for JUTC. Where can customers go other than going back to the area where you top up on the road, on the fly? How can persons check their balance? It is no longer on your receipt that you get when you put your card on the machine, so you can't know through that medium.
