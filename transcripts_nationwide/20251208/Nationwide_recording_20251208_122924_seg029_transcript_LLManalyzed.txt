British High Commissioner to Jamaica, Alicia Herbert. Known to EPA Lackson as Manchester United sitting 12th in the English Premier League League will enter Monday's clash against bottom-placed Wolverhampton Wanderers as firm favourite when the side meet at 3 p.m. Jamaica time at the Molyneux. Despite their inconsistent start to the season, United have a major incentive a victory would propel them six places up the table to sixth taking them to 25 points a level with Chelsea whose superior goal difference would keep them fifth. Wolves are at the foot of the standings and even a win would not change their position. Manchester United manager Ruben Amerin says his players are aware Wolves have not won in 14 games this season.
