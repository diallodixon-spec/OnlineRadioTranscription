20251217 104732 at camp meeting. Okay, all right, so for the uninitiated, every year the final major event for the conference is camp meeting. This is when the church comes together in usually a large place, the VH Persistenta is what we have, and it is filled with praise, with worship, with thanksgiving, lots of singing, and inspirational preaching. And this year, our preacher is the renowned evangelist, Pastor Shion O'Connor. He is no stranger to us, a child of Jamaica, originally from potential Jamaica conference, and now resides in the Cayman Islands, but certainly one who is known internationally for bringing the gospel to people with simplicity.
