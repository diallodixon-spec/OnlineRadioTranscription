20251216 153626 here among your clients and the wider public and I want some perspective I want from when you just started to today it's 26 years since I started out above Marley Museum well first at the back of my mother house yes right she she couldn't manage but she gave me an opportunity that he said all right this is what you want to do mm-hmm even be like a thing for me, run at the back and clients would come by the house and you know, mommy, them still nobody, nobody walk through the house. So I run out of the back, but people started to embrace their natural here. 26 years ago, let's say more locks than anything else. And for me, when I was growing up, of course, I grew up orthodox. My dad is an orthodox priest at the Ethiopian Orthodox Church. So I I grew up seeing locks and I started locking my hair. Let's say a couple of years old to high school. Yeah. You know, we're young people.
