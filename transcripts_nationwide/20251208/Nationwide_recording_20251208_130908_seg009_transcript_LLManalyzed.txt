to be known. That is a critical function of our justice of the peace. I just wanted to put my own support and GFJs behind Custis Fuller's comments and calls. Alright, thank you for that, Mikael. Uh so, I think we will go straight into our right of the week this week which comes from our deformation act 2013 and it speaks to when you can publish information. So, well, when you can have an action for a publication. So it states that a person has a single cause of action for defamation in relation to the publication of any defamatory matter. So that's anything that would be false on and would affect this person's reputation or their standing in the public. So if you have a defamatory matter, a statement, a video, whatever it is, and there are multiple pieces of defamation within it, you can only take one action on the matter itself, the document, the video, or whatever it is. You would not be able to take separate actions for each instance.
