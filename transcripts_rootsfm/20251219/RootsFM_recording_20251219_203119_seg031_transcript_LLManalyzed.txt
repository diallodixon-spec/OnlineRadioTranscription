20251219 203119 Wake up, wake up, cause you do it right. Baby, I got sick this morning. I see the storm inside me. Baby, I think I'm capsizing. The waves are rising and rising. And when I get that feeling, I want sexual healing. Sexual healing is good for me. Makes me feel so fine. It sucks to rush. Helps to redeem the mind. And it's good for us. Sexual healing, baby. It's good for me. Sexual healing is something that's good for me, that is good for me. And it's so good for me, my baby.
