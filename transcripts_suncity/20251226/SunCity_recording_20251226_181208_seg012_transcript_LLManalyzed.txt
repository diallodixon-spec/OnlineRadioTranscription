20251226 181208 You spend all that money on your watch How much time you spend with your son So much money in the club How much you spend with the ones you love The simple things are your blessings Simple things, them are your blessings, your blessing Simple things are your blessing And you don't notice your blessings You pick it with the shoes by your feet Now pick and choose the friends where you're key And now watch where you eat When lost, you get a good sleep The simple things are you blessings Simple things are you blessings. Simple things are your blessing.
