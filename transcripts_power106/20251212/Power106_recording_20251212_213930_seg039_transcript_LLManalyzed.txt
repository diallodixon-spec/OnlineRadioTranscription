20251212 213930 I'm so lonely without you Can't sleep at night always thinking about you But if I had the chance to start all over I would be wishing today on a four-leaf clover And leaving would be the last thing on my mind If I could turn back the hands of time Oh, baby Oh, darling I can't hold out much longer But the pain is getting deep all the hurt keep getting stronger but if i had just one more try i would be as alone until the day
