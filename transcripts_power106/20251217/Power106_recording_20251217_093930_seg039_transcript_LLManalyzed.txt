Right, no, it doesn't make sense. yes and every time we're in setup you have to move and then you switch over now to diesel that they apparently sell is more expensive to produce electric but the problem with the LNG is that it is supporting infrastructure that they have they bill that in to the bill to pay for that every time to move that ship you have to pay for that every time. To move that ship, you have to pay for that. Of course. So how can I continue with that? That arrangement cannot continue. I don't know if the people who did the design never factored in the cost relationship to move in the ship.
