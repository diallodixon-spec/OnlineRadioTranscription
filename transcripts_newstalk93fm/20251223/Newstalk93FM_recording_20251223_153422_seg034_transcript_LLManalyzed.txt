20251223 153422 I don't know about you but I come here to fight Come to play a mask I'm not leaving until I wet Come to play a mass I don't live my life with regrets No, I come to jam on a bumper Come to drink out a liquor Until my head's gone And I'm miserable All the money grown I'm causing trouble Look how these security watch me They don't know I'm out there I just mush up in place And I defect like I'm jumping I don't wait They don't want me in there for I see them They don't want because I do One way They don't want in there for I seen them I ain't don't listen to nothing they say
