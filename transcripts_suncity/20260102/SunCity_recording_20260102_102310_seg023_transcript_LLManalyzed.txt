20260102 102310 No demonic works performed shall prosper. The wages of blessing has ever lived in a life, so we keep our meditation in a highly high. We'll weather the storm and put up a fight, because we can do anything. And should you feel like giving up, let the strength of your ancestors fill your cup. The power of God preserves I and guides in all I do. So all the evils that kneel me home can go back where they came from. No demon who hurts but fall shall prosper, yeah. I tell you, hold your hand and sigh and smile.
