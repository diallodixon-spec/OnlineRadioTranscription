20251223 183926 I've been patient, and I've been waiting Call me stubborn, but I can't get over it You left and never said goodbye Those tears I cried No, I can't get over it So don't you ever let me down again Cause I'm depending on you So you better come through this time Please hear my cry and if I ever let you down, my friend, it was a misunderstanding. So if I took it for granted, then I promise from today I'll go jump like I never jumped, wave like I never waved, whine like I never wanted to, just to show you I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
