20251216 193222 Oh, gosh. Thankful for the blessings that are falling on my table. Learning all my lessons now I'm willing and I'm able to do just what I can. As humble as I am, working towards the goal. And we give thanks for helping hands. Pray for health and spent a life of length and peace of mind. Good people and goodbyes. We give thanks every time, in every single line. Even if it ain't rhyme, I'll go sing redemption songs to the people when I think of where I'm coming from. Looking back at where the journey begun, I really have to say that I'm strong. I'm strong. All praise is the most I want. Look at where I'm coming from, looking back where the journey begun.
