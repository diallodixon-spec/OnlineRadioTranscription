20251229 140100 Good afternoon. I'm Deidre N. Gordon with the Business Headlines. The initial public offering of Dequity Capital Management Limited, which closed on December 18, will not proceed. This was announced by VM Wealth Management Limited, which is the lead broker. VM says the company did not reach the minimum subscription amount required under the prospectus. All subscription funds will be fully refunded without interest within 10 business days, no later than January 6. Applicants may be contacted if additional information is needed for a refund. John Levy, General Secretary of UK, is urging the government to increase the amount of money that older people can contribute to their pensions tax-free to 30% from the current 20%. He argues that this would enable them to have access to more funds when they retire in order to deal with the high cost of living.
