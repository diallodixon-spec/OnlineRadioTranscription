20251230 202214 Oh Like the fire and corruption make you baby, they can't stop playing for you. Doing one rookie never say he's all sweet, with a quit already hit me hard with. Youth ain't a last, half time's a go pass. Never listen to them when they say you can't do it. Remind that it's good to be humble and it's good be bold. Stay true to who you are because it's good for the soul. They never really want wanted to make it this true to be done, but they're just here for a plan for you. Have a purpose in your life, open up your eyes. Otherwise you'll never realize that you've got love powers inside. Stand steady on the journey, cause we'll live.
