Keep on telling them that you will go away Cause what? Two wrongs can't make no right Now, ain't nothing wrong with a good ol' fight It's alright If you feel it boy You can feel this feeling all around the world It's okay If you feel it Forget everything and everybody But if it to do, forget you too You and your coupe people keep on telling me your love is here to stay But I keep on telling them that you will go away
