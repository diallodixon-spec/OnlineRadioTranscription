Is it still the same or you know, they need to check first? If they need, you know where the type five Locations are so there are some there are some changes especially for persons within the western region Yes, and the Southern region. Of course, we have some facilities that there are tents being put up and there may be a lot of persons turning out for the tents. But we want to tell persons that screening is still an essential service that is offered at the primary care level. And I'll tell you why. So a man may think, OK, I'm not sick. I'm not feeling any symptoms everything is fine with me i'm gonna bypass my screening since we had the hurricane and since you know our facility is down this is not something that's important i want to tell our men that listen it is still important
