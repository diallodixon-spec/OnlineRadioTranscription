loans are classified as current, while 11,634 are delinquent, and 14,836 remain on moratorium or payment freeze. Against that background, Mrs. Walsh's students can now apply to benefit from the Bureau's Debt Reset Program. The initiative targets borrowers adversely affected by Hurricane Melissa, as well as those already in arrears. Under the program, eligible borrowers may benefit from a moratorium on payments, reduced loan balances, the removal of accumulated charges, and the opportunity to restart repayments on a more manageable basis. She says beginning December 1, 50% of all outstanding interest will be forgiven, along with 100 percent of all late fees and insurance charges. Mrs. Walsh adds that during the five-month period from December this year to April next year, borrowers must repay 100 percent of their outstanding principal, excluding fees.
