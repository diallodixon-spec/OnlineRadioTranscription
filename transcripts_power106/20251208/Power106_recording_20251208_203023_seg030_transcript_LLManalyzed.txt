From Toronto to Ottawa and Montreal, the Jamaican community across Canada has been mobilizing support to assist Jamaica with its post-hurricane recovery efforts. Community groups and diaspora leaders are hosting fundraisers, concerts and volunteer drives. Consul General of Jamaica at Toronto, Kurt Davis, says the support from Jamaicans and friends across Canada has been phenomenal. In addition to individuals, organizations and registered charities are also reaching out to support the Hurricane Melissa recovery efforts. We've seen outreach from so many persons who are so concerned about what has taken place in Jamaica and are jumping on board to see how they can also be a part of helping to come to a resolution, helping the people who are facing the devastation.
