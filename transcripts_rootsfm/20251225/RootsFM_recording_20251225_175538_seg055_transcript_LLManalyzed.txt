Well it's been a year, it doesn't surprise me Last Christmas, I wrapped it up and sent it With a note, saying I love you, I meant it Now I know what a fool I've been But if you kiss me now, you fool me again Last Christmas, I gave you my heart The very next day, you gave it away This year to save me from tears I gave it to someone special Last Christmas I gave you my heart The very next day
