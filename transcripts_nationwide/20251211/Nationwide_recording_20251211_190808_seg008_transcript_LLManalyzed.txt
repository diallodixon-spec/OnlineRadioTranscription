I mean, I think I said to Cliff quite a while back when we were still at Bradley Avenue that the mind of someone so young and the damage that social media can potentially do, that there needs to be some safeguards in place. I don't know if it should be an outright ban or it should be some other system, but there needs to be safeguards to limit the access that those under a certain age have to social media. It's a very dangerous thing. I know the technology, it's difficult to keep pace with it, but I think it's something that we have to explore even here in Jamaica. Yeah, but I don't think it's the government's role. I think parents should be the ones who regulate access to social media.
