No one ever can understand it The way the system plans There's no hope, no chance, no loophole No escape for a sufferer man Cause every time I lift my head above water And try to save myself from drown There's an overnight scheme all worked out Designed to keep me down Still I'm putting up a resistance Now I'm gonna work it out You know I'm putting up resistance I've gotta work it out Blue window, blue window I wanna stay home tonight I long to spend some time with the family But staying home won't make it right Sometimes the pressure make me feel like father When every sign says no way out Breaking my back to make an overtime dollar
