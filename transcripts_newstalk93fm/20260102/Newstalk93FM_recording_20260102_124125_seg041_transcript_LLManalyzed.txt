20260102 124125 I don't need nothing from you Your beautiful autism use I've been reckless with my choices Can't seem to get what the point is Life can be rough, can be smooth And not every fact is the truth Advancing and playing down my burdens Can't seem to silence the voices You are deserving of the love you are not getting. Independently, I'll take the liberty. And I'm gonna love you specially, oh.
