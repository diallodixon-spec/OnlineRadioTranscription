All I want for Christmas Is I'll be to dance in time If you don't have any money I will let you have some of mine All here I've been working Now this is my time for fun You should feel the same way Just put on your new shoes and come Well, make the Christmas get you in a good mood Make the Christmas get you feeling fine
