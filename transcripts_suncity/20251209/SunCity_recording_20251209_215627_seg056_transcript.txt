Why can't we just all do nothing Everything's planned out, business set up Hurricane's been up, everything mash up Oh my brother, please keep your head up Just know that there's no time to give up My sister though, everything blew over Never forget to pray Cause no matter the law, no matter the cost There'll be a better day Hey, this is Spliffy this was called champion spliffy on the radio
