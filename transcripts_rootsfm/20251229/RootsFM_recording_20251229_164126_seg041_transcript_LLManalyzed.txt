I've got to leave you now Because it's getting late And I've got someone she's waiting for me She's standing at my gate And the reason why She's waiting so patiently Because she broke my heart last night And tonight she wanna make it up with me So hear me sing True love will never die No matter how you try True love will never Die I wanna know the reason why
