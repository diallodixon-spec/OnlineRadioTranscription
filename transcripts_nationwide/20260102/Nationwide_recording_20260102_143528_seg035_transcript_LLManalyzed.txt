20260102 143528 You wanna see me all alone As legend has it, you are quite the pyro You like the match to watch it blow And if you'd never call for me I might've drowned in a mountain calling I swore my loyalty to me, myself and I Right before you lit my sky off All that time I sat alone in my tower You were just haunting me powers Now I can see it all Now you took me out of my grave and Saved my heart from the fate of Ophelia You can't get me under on the land where the sea's in the sky Pledge allegiance to your hands, your team, your fives You care where the hell you've been, cause now, now Your mind is bound to be the street for stars
