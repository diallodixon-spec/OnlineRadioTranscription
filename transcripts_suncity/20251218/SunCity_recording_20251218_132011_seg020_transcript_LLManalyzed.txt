20251218 132011 Seems to me seem so clear. I'm just hearing what I wanna hear And the only words I hear are from my heart. I couldn't change. And if I could, I guess you know I never would. Because I felt the way I'm feeling from the start. It looks like I fooled myself again But you know I'm a fool for you
