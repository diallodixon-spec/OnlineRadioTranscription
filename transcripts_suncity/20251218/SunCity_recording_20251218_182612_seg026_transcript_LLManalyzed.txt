20251218 182612 with somebody who wants it to look attractive, here's what I would say. Giving back is very attractive. Number one, it allows you to build skills that you can't have by just reading your textbook. So you're building skills that can enhance your resume. I tried to do how many things on my resume, got me into big rooms that paid big dollars because of things that I did for free, for service, for giving back, right? So it helps you to build your portfolio and build your resume. It can also bring you visibility. These young people who are sitting with you now in studio, they're on radio, you know, they possibly haven't been on TV or probably will be because they are giving back and this is a visibility economy. You might be doing good work, but because knows you, nobody wants to pay you or engage you, especially in the Caribbean context, especially in Jamaica, people are booking them and say who is you? Who is him? I never hear about him yet, you get me? A big way that you get this kind of visibility is through giving back.
