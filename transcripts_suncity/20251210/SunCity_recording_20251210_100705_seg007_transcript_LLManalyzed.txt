that Christmas type of girl in terms of songwriting, in terms of singing Christmas carols. I'm always singing other people's Christmas carols, but not my own original composition. I'm not the writer, although I'm not the write for it. I'm the singer of a very beautiful song written by Paul Pachi Wright. And it's really a great song. When you listen to it, it gives you this loving dovey mushy mushy feel good vibe and that's really the energy that i want people to get especially my fellow jamaicans and those who have you know suffered big losses in the you know the hurricane that we had there recently and you know and pretty much that's it yeah wonderful wonderful so, you know you spoke about hurricane Melissa and how some people Have been affected by this hurricane So, you know the song definitely has a hopeful feeling in it. So what made you feel hopeful again and what?
