20251226 170402 Hey, girl, what's up? So hold on. Why you look so vexed this early? They ain't just that. Lisa, it is so good to see you. But sorry you catch me like this, girl. My uncle sent one by now. When my family go for clarity, you don't want to hear the price of the people they put on or something. But matters worse, me hear say half of the thing they missing. And me know say a custom. Girl, oh, you know say a customs. Lisa, stop going like you're not having a sense, man. You know say customs? You know how to stop listening to hearsay? Have you ever experienced that? Customs don't go into your package, suitcase, barrel or cargo unless you ship the item or the agent stand up right there when they inspect it. Listen, customs job is to protect the borders, collect revenue and to facilitate trade. Them not collect or store shipment, them inspect it and somebody after present it for inspection. So how customs ever get so much customers?
