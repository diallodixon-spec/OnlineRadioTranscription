Nationwide, 90 FM. Fill us up with your mercy And let it fill what they're starving How a lot am still wanting Job without you, we're empty Fill us up with their mercy Man shall not live by bread alone And I know But by the words that proceeded from Jadah Man shall not leave my bread alone And I know, but by the words that preceded from Jadah When they pulled what they're starving, I will ask them why
