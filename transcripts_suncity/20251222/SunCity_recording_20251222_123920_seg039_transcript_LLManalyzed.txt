20251222 123920 We used to sing forever But I'll remember you A pure and simple heart Shadows through the dark I will always love you I'll remember you Summer rain, deformed snow We knew that it would last, but there's no way to know. There's nowhere to go. It's such a stillness in the sky. Quietly we pass, quietly cry. Here I stand, alone in there, the promise melting through my hands. Oh, oh, oh.
