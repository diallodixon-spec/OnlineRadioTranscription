============================================================

Sitting here in limbo Like a bird without a song Well, they're putting up resistance But I know that my faith will lead me on Sitting here in rainbow Waiting for the dice to roll Sitting here in rainbow got some time to search my soul. Well, they're putting up resistance, but I know that my faith will lead me on.
