Nobody gets too much heaven no more It's much harder to come back I'm waiting in line Nobody gets too much love anymore It's as high as a mountain And harder to climb Ooh, you and me, girl Got a lot of love in store And it flows through you And it flows through me And I love you so much more And my love I can see beyond forever Everything we own will never die Love is such a beautiful name
