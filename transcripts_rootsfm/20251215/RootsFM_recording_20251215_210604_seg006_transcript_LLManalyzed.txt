20251215 210604 They come with their evilest thoughts And justice to whenever they're told I used to lie to you my dog He cut and cleared all my boards They fight me without a cause Trying to make my life so hard Picking up things on the Lord of Floods Give a trial reward So solid as a rock They just can't stop me now Even when they say they're troughs They can't just stop me now People they say this and that, they just can't stop me now. Even when they set up roadblocks, they can't just stop me now. Go down to mix me up in your dirty gang. You're only trying to tarnish my name. You're only looking for the innocent to blame. When you're the ones who wish you could dance down the lane, you only got this wrong.
