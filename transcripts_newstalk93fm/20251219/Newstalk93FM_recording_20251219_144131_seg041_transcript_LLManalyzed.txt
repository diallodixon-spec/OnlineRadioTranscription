20251219 144131 I want you laying me down So we're dead and buried On the edge of your night Staying drunk on your vibe The angels up in the clouds Are jealous now that we've found So this world is ordinary You got me kissing the ground I'm a sanctuary Chatter me when you're done Oh Lord, return me to dust The angels up in the clouds are jealous, know what we found Something so heavenly, higher than ecstasy Whenever you're next to me, oh mama What was it black and white? Until I saw your light how are you laying me down to a dead and buried on the edge of your night staying drunk on your vibe
