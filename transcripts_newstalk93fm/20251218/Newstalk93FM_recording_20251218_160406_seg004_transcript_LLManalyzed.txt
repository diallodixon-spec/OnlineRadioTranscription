20251218 160406 I'm not coming home tonight. I'm not going home tonight. I was grabbed by the melodies Now the liquor take all of me And the bass knock my soul out and make sure soca won't let me leave. I don't know if I'll survive, song after song, wine after wine. I go sing strong and fit for life. Weak like the masses, kryptonite. I can't find me, we're bound for shaking, high and beating people.
