If you want me to go, you can be looking the way you do. You can be cooking the way you do, you can be hooking me. You can be hooking the way you do because you're hooking me. No matter what I say you were hearing, you said the love disappearing. On the drawer and cupboard you're clearing my shop with interest When I met you So if you're waiting, you know, baby, no, but you put it on the ground by the roadside you tend to get out your place to come inside baby don't do me that you're gonna break my heart can't believe you're ready to give up on me just so cause if you want me to go you gotta be looking the way you do you gotta be cooking the way you do
