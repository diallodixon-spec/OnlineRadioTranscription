20251215 215837 I used to hang out every night Running round in the clubs Yeah, I thought I had everything I thought I never needed love That's when God sent an angel Straight down from up above She came and swept me off my feet Showed me the meaning of true love. Now my friends, yeah, they ask me why I don't hang like I used to. Some even laugh and call me name, like old man and party pooper. But I found me a good thing, and I don't care what they say. Tell them when I get time, I might come through, but I can't care what they say Tell them when I get time I might come through But I can't come through this day Can't stay too long I gotta keep movin' My girl she waitin' I don't wanna be foolin'
