So when they drive up to him now, because the hairstyle is different from the picture. So I said, I'm going to zoom in the picture so I just want to see the face. So when I drive up close to him and I wind down the window and I look, I said, Jesus. I see another little girl, you know. I said, when the man reached to the window, I said, oh, I saw. So I tried to wind him up because I don't know if he has a weapon. Someone was on the window, even halfway. He said, do that little girl there to you. He held her hand tight and walked fast up. I said, Jesus. I'll take him and I'll take all the benefits through. The driver passed him and stopped almost in the road and said oh it stopped and he turned the next one and said drive out of the vehicle. I said I'll just sit down and I run out because I said Jesus I don't want to. He ran up to me and he ran up on the man and grabbed him and said whoa what did you do?
