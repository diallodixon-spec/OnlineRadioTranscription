20251229 130405 An income per capita cannot be arranged, sir. The average income for people, black people, while we're working is 50 to 40 thousand. But I want to ask you something else. No, no, no. Can I say something else? We're not moving off when what you just said is absolute nonsense. Those are not the facts. An income per capita cannot be arranged. Sir, sir, an income per capita can not be arranged. The income per capita is calculated as a single figure. It is not a range. The range calls for something called a median. You have to look at the figures, the raw figures. You can't go to AI or whatever and ask for it to be calculated. You have to know what you are looking for. I explained all of this last week and you've come back this week. Hear me out man because I'm now being very tolerant. I am now being very tolerant I am telling you what to go and look for sir.
