I tell my wife I love your vibe but you should come along She's sending vines to all we like and we about 40 strong Who want the left, who want the right, we going ultra tough My relatives they want the line but I tell them Take it, see you when I come back This time I will come back, late to work from morning Till I slap away from that street, hold your right book on You don't know how long I wait So when you see them do this come around This time is my time to jump on, my time to rumble
