one and two instances elsewhere in Jamaica. What should families know about staying safe without without panicking? Okay, so leptospirosis is a bacterial infection and it's caused by water becoming contaminated by the urine of animals, especially rats. So when you have standing water, especially some of the parishes where there's still water that hasn't quite receded fully, you can find that that water is contaminated. If you're going through that water, walking through that water, you need to wear protective clothing. And if you don't have them, wash your body, wash your skin immediately after exposure. Also, you don't want to move too quickly. First of all, what I want people to understand, it's animals, especially rats, but not only rats. I was pointing that out to someone the other day because I was observing something and I said to them, hello, why are you trying to bring down leptospirosis?
