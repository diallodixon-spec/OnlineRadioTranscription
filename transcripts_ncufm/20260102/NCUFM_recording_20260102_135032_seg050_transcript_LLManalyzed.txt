20260102 135032 My friends, we are not left alone. Christ is with us. We just need to choose to be with him. We can be sure that he's faithful, keeps his promises, and he certainly will help us during our difficult times and be with us in all times, good times and bad times. He's your best friend. Want to choose him today? We will see tomorrow. That was your Sabbath school nugget with Pastor Robert Wright. This is NCU 91.1, 91.3, and 91.5.
