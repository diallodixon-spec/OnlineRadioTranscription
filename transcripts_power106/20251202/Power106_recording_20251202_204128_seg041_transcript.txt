Power to move you. Power 106. Hey, what's the matter? Yeah, it is raining pretty hard. I tell you what, get in my car and I'll take you home, okay? Oh, thank goodness you came along. Oh, it's my pleasure. Tell me this, how far do you live? Not far, about two miles up the road. Oh, okay, no problem. Oh, thanks. Sure ain't no problem. No, there ain't no problem at all. The Spanish is not driving all the way to California. And our old points in west of here. Maybe that's why she won't come. This girl is mad. Sure wish the fellows could see me now. They wouldn't believe me. Ain't nobody gonna believe me.
