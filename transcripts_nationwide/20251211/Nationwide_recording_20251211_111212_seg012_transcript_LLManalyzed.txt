the mayor and the town clerk about valley view road in rolling spring it is impossible and yes we know that the dislocation in the west is going to take priority however you can't um allow other roads in the corporate area to deteriorate beyond repair so valley, Valley View Road, please Mr. Mayor and Mr. Robert Hill Town Clerk. Also, it would be good if we could get a schedule, just as we did with the roads on Spark, the roads in the corporate area now. I'm talking about from Golden Spring to Manor Park. If we could have get a schedule after when that road will be paved, it would be useful if we have a schedule so that we know we're not waiting in vain. Shit. Yeah.
