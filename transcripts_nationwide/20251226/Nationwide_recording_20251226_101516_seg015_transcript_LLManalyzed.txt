20251226 101516 I'll be good I'll be good Flash we meet, passing in the streets Words unspoken, sign up for more in the hate Just by chance, we're all into romance Cry of success, let no one do it Hold on, hold on Love is not the style it's for We've been trying to find love like before No other change is a picture through the paint More than the sense that you love me
