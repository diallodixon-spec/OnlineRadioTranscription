All I'm for me and you go to make honey And if you're milking a fight, see I saw me too low Gelato honey, oh baby, smile, you're deep, deep, deep Baby, kona, kona Kaka waka when you enter my lija Baby, kona kona Who you give me sugar and wala, wala Macho Mona Lisa, macho Mona Lisa Macho Mona Lisa I don't wanna leave. I'm not home. I'm not Lisa. I don't want to leave. I don't know. Not Lisa. Not home. Not Lisa.
