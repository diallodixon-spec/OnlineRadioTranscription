We're going to be the best in anything. They are not ready. I will give you 100%. You are deserving of the love you are not getting. Iently, I'll take the liberty. And I gonna love you special, yo. All the love, all the care, them they fake out. Don't be hard, baby, give it. I gonna love you. All the love, all the care, damn, damn fake love. Don't be hard, baby, keep it, I'm gonna love. Why you so colorful? I can't see melodies from my chest.
