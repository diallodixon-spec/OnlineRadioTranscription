20260101 195323 I don't wanna move a thing It might change my memory Oh, I am what I am I'll do what I want But I can't hide And I won't go I won't sleep I won't go. I won't sleep. I can't breathe until you're resting here with me. And I won't live. And I can't hide. I cannot be until you're resting here with me I don't wanna call my friends
