20251229 160204 You can still be shy in the morning So don't feel away You don't like the fast life When you come on the bright side I go take the blame I just want you come and light it up Just a little ride now Come and meet me in the truck and we rev it up The whole day Keep throwing it back at the way you stopped us up Baby, no way We could boast of all the pictures you want When you're ready I could overshare, darling You could overdo it But we could eat in the middle and start a bacchanal. Play in the middle, hey, what we gonna do now? Jam to a rhythm and eat a carnival. What we gonna do now, start a wine on the head. I say compromise on the head. Baby, spend time on it.
