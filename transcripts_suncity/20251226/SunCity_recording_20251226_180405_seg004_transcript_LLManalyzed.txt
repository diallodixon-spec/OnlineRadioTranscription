20251226 180405 and the Pic 9. Pic 9 carryover, 543,216. That's it for Boxing Day Racing. Tomorrow is Saturday. So of course we'll be back tomorrow with more live racing from the track. Until then, my name is Barry Green. Turning it back over to Chrisonic. He's not working overtime, he's working. Today feels like a Saturday. He just told me he's working till 7.'s. Fight into a delicious Dave's Classic or Spicy Chicken Sandwich with the juicy black forest ham and topped with zesty pepper jelly. Proceed from every ham-tastic, so go towards hurricane relief. It's a Ham-tastic season only at Wendy's. Zoom in.
