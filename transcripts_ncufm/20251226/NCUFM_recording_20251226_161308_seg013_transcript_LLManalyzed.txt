20251226 161308 Sweet, sweet victory in Jesus For me He died, but He rose on the third day That's why I have truth to build every day I'm not worried about material things I don't have I just rest as I'm sure if my saviors care Cause I know my blessing is on the way I can't see it right now, but I stand by faith I fought many, many battles in His. I held up the bloodstain and proclaimed that Jesus is the truth of the life. But even when I say He will make it all right. I've got the victory. I've got to switch between Jesus. Yes, I do. He is my conqueror. He is my new conqueror. I've got my trust. I'm gonna stand by faith. Oh, I've got it. I've got it in victory. But everyone's on the verge. That's why I have true victory every day.
