20251216 110001 from people like yourself and in different areas so bring the people like the PSOJs to the board and because they can put the pressure on the government and to have that conversation with you know Floyd and Minister of Finance and all the respective parties to say okay how can we turn this catastrophe into an opportunity to help us move forward and then at the the same point in time, let's say I'm from Westmoreland and Westmoreland in itself was pretty much dead because of the no more sugar and all of that. It gives us an opportunity to recreate the different parishes to see how we can move forward. So I encourage us all to utilize that. Okay, the PSOJ is listening to you because they are unwilling to put the government under any pressure. Well, that is where we need that agitation now from that regard. Of course, but they are very unwilling to put the Government under any pressure. You know, when they say that when tide rise or ship rise, so this will benefit them.
