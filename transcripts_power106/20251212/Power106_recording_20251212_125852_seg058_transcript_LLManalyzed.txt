2025-12-12 13:28:28 down there. Let's say the man sent 15,000 troops off the coast of Venezuela, a battleship, planes, an aircraft carrier, what do you need to send CIA for? He's intending to invade. No, but he could send them down there to go, you know, and then they come back with that kind of conspiracy theory. And you think the CIA is not operating in Venezuela at the moment? No, but what I'm saying here, instead he just calls the man by phone and just tell him what he wants to tell him. No, I'm asking you a question. Do you think the CIA isn't operating in Venezuela right now? Well, I'm not saying there's not some covertly operation going on down there, but he's not going by that. You just call the man, let him know what you want him to know and this is what you expect of him and stuff like that. You don't bother with the conspiracy. Who gave him the right to say that to Venezuela?
