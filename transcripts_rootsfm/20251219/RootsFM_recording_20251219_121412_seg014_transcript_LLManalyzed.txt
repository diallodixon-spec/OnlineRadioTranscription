20251219 121412 Thank you, Jesus. Thank you. Touch all the people who are going to do their business over on the weekend. We pray for guidance and protection up on the street, in the byways and edges. Oh, God, touch even the car. I've got every accident, every danger. We cut down with tear, down with cramp of correlates. Oh, sick right now. I've been pain in the head, in the stomach. Touch it, oh, God, in the belly. Oh, for belly is giving a warm time. Touch it, Almighty God. Reverse it, send it back to sender who uproot and trample. Touch the fireman, the fisherman, O God, to touch them, O God. O God, family out there who don't remember their family. So bless them, O God, send somebody from the east, west, north, south, and west. Bless them, Lord. They say it come to pass. Where the child was born. It was a star there that lead that lead those angels to that baby in the mighty name of Jesus. Thank you all for listening. Thank you so much, Latoya.
