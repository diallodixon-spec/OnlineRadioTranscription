20260102 201812 Mr. G in New York City I don't know what condition New York City is in, but I know last year it was really cold. I certainly hope it has improved, Mr. G, but I know you locked into the 94th of Europe. Whether it's ice or snow or rain or whatever, you plan to have a good time on a Friday night with us, all right? Pat in 19. Thank you very much Pat for your kind words. Doreen in Top Mountain also in the house. Doreen says hey she's locked in and she's sending well wishes to the staff of Raidedge
