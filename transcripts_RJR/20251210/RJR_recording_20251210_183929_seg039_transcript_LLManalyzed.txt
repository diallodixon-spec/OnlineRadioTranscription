kick me out. And most of the times I just prefer to leave because I could get food in the marketplace from vendors and I would love to go to the dance on weekends believing I was big. At 10 years old, you couldn't tell me that I wasn't a grown woman. And I would go in the dance and they would give me food. And they were viewing me as a child, but I thought I was a big woman, grown woman on my own, doing everything grown women do, you know, up and about trying to sort out my life, trying to go to school and all of that stuff. Were there people looking out for you? Because I noticed you said you were being viewed as a child. So is it that you had some guardian angels there helping to keep you safe? I would imagine, you know, the Lord said when your mother and your father forsake you, then the Lord will take you up. That's what the Bible says. So I would imagine there was some destiny helper there, unbeknown to me.
