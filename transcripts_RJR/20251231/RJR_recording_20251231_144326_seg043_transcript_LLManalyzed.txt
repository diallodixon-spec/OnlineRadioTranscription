20251231 144326 When should we stop trying to self-diagnose, we're monitoring it, or googling symptoms? I don't mind the Google doctors. You know how people, I know there are some doctors who don't like it, I don't mind a Google doctor. You know why? Because I feel like you are your best doctor in the sense that if you don't come and tell me that you have a headache or whatever, whatever your symptoms are, there's no way I can treat you properly. So that's okay to be up with your body. But when you have a symptom that is getting worse after a few days, and it keeps going on for weeks, and you keep Googling and watching, that makes no sense to me.
