Radio Jamaica 94 FM and it's hotline where truth comes to live and lies come to die. You know, I feel bad about having to run away from to about the conversations having with the elder earlier on and hopefully we can speak a little bit more about it later. Gonna read some more messages. Good morning Mr. Taylor. I watch every ground provision and season, whether putting in the fridge or keeping it outside. Yeah. We, the residents of Weddellinnes, Huntley, Manchester, have the same concern. We are yet to receive our light, even though just one of the wires burst. The main road has light. It's just three minutes from the main road. They don't turn on none of us. None of the light. None of the off-roads. And we are suffering in that. It's just grossly unfair to us. Well, you know...
