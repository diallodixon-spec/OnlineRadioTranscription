the one parliament situation of course you know he got some people to become what you call senators independent otherwise but but he was a man of his word and I remember when he made his transition yes and that huge crowd on North Street with the surrounding of the Holy Trinity Cathedral. And you're talking people of all political persuasion that came out of that thing. I think there's a thing in the archives of Radio Jamaica where Mrs. Gluedon did a thing. And it is very interesting if you could listen to the description of Barbara Glewdon when the coffin was lifted to be taken into the cathedral and the description of the crowd outside. Believe me, it is a masterpiece.
