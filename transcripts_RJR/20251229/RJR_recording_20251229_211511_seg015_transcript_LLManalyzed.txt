20251229 211511 Find yourself another set of blue strings little boy Cause you're hurting me more Every minute that you delay Oh when you need me when you need me When you need me, when you need me... When you walk on the subtitle like this You're getting just a little bit too far for me to resist So why don't you go on away, little boy? Why don't stand so close to me when you try to get that last goodbye kiss. I know your moves now.
