No, may I say, Mary, please, I ain't gonna do that. Let me just tell you something. I love eating what I plant. You know what you're selling? I'm not gonna sell out myself. I love eating what I plant. It's just different seasoning, different pleasure, different everything to me. It means everything to me. Well respect that. Because when you go out there, you're not so sure, you get what I'm saying? I know how I deal with my thing. You get what I'm sayin'? Yeah, man. Yeah, man, I know how deal with my things. So, me prefer that, you get what i'm sayin'? It's Mr. Kaskildo, a roof down here, I tell you, you know.
