20251225 201414 I'm not everything in this magical world, this world Turn it up, you know she ain't too tough Turn up, turn off the lights Turn off the lights Turn it up, she ain't too rough Turn up, turn on the lights Turn on the lights Follow me, I can't lose what you're looking for To, to take you home And show you what my heart can do To go to heaven when there's no dream
