No trade unionist I've ever heard has ever spoken that he's not willing to engage in productivity as a matter of fact. The truth is to be spoken. It is the trade union movement that has been driving that out. Even the public sector reform and even what we have gone through with the myriad of issues and they are very important issues I'm trying to understand how you how you conceive that process I say we have to talk about total factor productivity. We talk about all the ingredients that make up productivity, if we are going to talk about it seriously. We have to talk about the tools that are being used, we have talk about the training, and that is what we call total factor productivity.
