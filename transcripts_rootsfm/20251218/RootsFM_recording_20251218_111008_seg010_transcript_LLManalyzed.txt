As we approach the festive season, we want to take a moment to remind everyone, not only just the St. Andrew's South Division, to prioritize their safety and security. And always remember that no one can do that for you, except you. We can encourage you, we can give you tips, we can give your ideas. But you have to make sure that you protect yourself.
