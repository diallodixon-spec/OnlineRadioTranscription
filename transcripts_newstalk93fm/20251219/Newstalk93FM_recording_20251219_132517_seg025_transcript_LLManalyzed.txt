20251219 132517 I'm a bee, in a dangerous mood, can you match my time? Telling me that you're really about it, why'd you hide it? Talk is cheap, so show me that you understand I like it can you blow my mind sit off my whole body if i give you my time can you stretch my soul from it if i don't wanna wait i'll take it take me where i ain't been before. Can you blow my mind? Set off my whole body, whole body.
