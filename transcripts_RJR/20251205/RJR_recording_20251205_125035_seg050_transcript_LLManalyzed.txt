1970s yeah yeah that's that's far back you know for some for you and Daniel only because I was a small child yes yes yes right right so the ice cream bucket didn't have dry ice in it it had actual ice and where I live you didn't you were anywhere near ice factory so the ice truck came once a week on a Thursday with big blocks of ice right? Right, you buy the block of ice, you put it in a corkous bag with sawdust, and you bury it. Yes, we thought about that in the next one. Yes, so by the time Sunday comes, maybe a third of it will melt out. But you know, you still have enough to put in your ice bucket with coarse salt, because the coarse salt is what keeps the ice really cold. And that's the way you made the ice cream, mostly condensed milk, as Daniel said, and something, some kind of cornstarch kind of mixture, it's called custard powder. So everybody ice cream had one flavor, condensed milk and custard powder.
