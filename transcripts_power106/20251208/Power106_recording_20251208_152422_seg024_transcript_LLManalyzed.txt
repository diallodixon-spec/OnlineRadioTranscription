If, however, you have a sale agreement and you paid your deposit, then certainly you can use that to launch a KVET to temporarily stop them from selling it. Because remember, a KVET is not a permanent solution. You have to follow it up with legal action. Just to go back to a previous question where someone had asked what's their standing, their mother will it to their sister, but they're already on the title. And I said, it depends on whether they owned as joint tenants or tenants in common. This person has sent a follow-up message saying they own as joint tenants. So as I said, if you own as joint tenants, that section in your mother's will would not be valid because if your mother died before you then you become the sole owner all right but bear in mind though I'm not sure if your mother is deceased or she's alive so let us say you know died before
