Good morning. Good morning. You're back here inside the Consumer Hour on Nationwide 90 FM. I am Norege Banton and this morning we have our friends from Rent-a-Kill Initial with us. Today we are joined by Director of Pest Prevention and Control, Barrington Stair and Sales Manager at Rent-a-kill Initial, Lisa Maria James. We've been talking for a little bit about birds and where they nest areas that we don't necessarily want them to be nesting and the risks that can come with having those birds there. But Rent-a-kill Initial has a solution for everything I'm learning. So talk to me about how Rent-a-Kill can assist you with nesting birds that are nesting in your business place, your structure, whatever. So good morning again, everyone. So the first thing is Rent-a-kill provides you with the knowledge, which is why we are here, right?
