Interview with Consultant Psychiatrist Dr. Jeffrey Walcott

In a recent radio program, Consultant Psychiatrist Dr. Jeffrey Walcott shared his expertise on coping with grief, particularly in the context of sudden loss. Dr. Walcott emphasized the importance of acknowledging and processing emotions, stating that "if a person seems to be having a challenge getting through their normal day for longer than two weeks, then there is need for professional intervention." He also highlighted the significance of seeking help, noting that "the process should not be impacting your functionality for greater than probably a two or three week period."

Dr. Walcott's advice is particularly relevant in light of recent events, such as the economic challenges generated by Hurricane Melissa. His words of wisdom serve as a reminder that seeking help is a crucial step in navigating the complexities of grief. As Dr. Walcott so aptly put it, "it's important to take the time and follow through and answer the questions of the persons that are grieving because it allows them to move beyond the stage of shock and denial."

Interview with Painter Christopher Scott and Jeweler "The Girl and the Magpie"

In another segment of the radio program, host Joy Kelly spoke with painter Christopher Scott and jeweler "The Girl and the Magpie" about the annual Potters' Fair and its role in promoting economic recovery. Christopher Scott, who traveled from Landylo, Westmanland to attend the event, shared his perspective on the importance of taking action and creating opportunities. "You have to get up and do things," he said. "You have to change the narrative on your own. You have to create the opportunities for you."

"The Girl and the Magpie" echoed Scott's sentiments, highlighting the significance of events like the Potters' Fair in supporting local artisans and communities. "It's double important," she said. "Important for the artisan, because all the artisans don't have any place to sell right now. If all the market is stopping, the tourist sector, where the gift shop would take, it stops also. People don't buy because they think it's not the time to celebrate."

Their conversation shed light on the vital connection between art appreciation and commerce, demonstrating how events like the Potters' Fair can serve as a driver of economic recovery. As Joy Kelly noted, "your cash, your purchasing power, does a fair bit to keep the wheels of commerce churning, inflows in Kingston, distributed island-wide, more effectively than a care package."
