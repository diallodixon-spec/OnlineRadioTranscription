You leave me, babe, but I still get the message Instead of lines, three dots, but I can connect And if it ain't right, babe, you know I respect it But if you need time, just take your time Honey, I get it, I get it I get it The way you got me all in my head I think I'd rather you in my bed Wherever it is, you know I can take it Counting the days, how many days till I can see you again
