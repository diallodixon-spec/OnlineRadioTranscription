So in the coming year, we are planning on seeing how best we can explore other options to have our female members that get a chance to explore a little bit more on what they have learned and how they have been developing. Since this year, we had one female compete in a boxing match outside of Jamaica. She lost, but she got some experience that she would not have gained not fighting while she's here. And we see that as something valuable and something that will help us to build more on, correct whatever mistakes that we saw that needed to be corrected and, you know, have a clearer mindset or a clearer vision of some of the things that we need to work on.
