I'm talkin' I-I-I-I, baby I know how it is I feelin' right at home, save me your arms, baby Come hold me down down. Come hold me down, huh? Save like a key and a lock on me, save like a crib with a combo, please. Hold you down, hold you down, down, down. I can put my guard down, I can put my heart up. Love when you're around. Love when you around, huh? Unplug the alarm now, show you on my card now. Look, I don't need a rich bitch to somebody that can make me feel safe Yeah, look, I don't want a couple, but nobody ever made me feel safe like you Because when I'm with you, I just know I'm fine You take all the pressure off my mind all the time
