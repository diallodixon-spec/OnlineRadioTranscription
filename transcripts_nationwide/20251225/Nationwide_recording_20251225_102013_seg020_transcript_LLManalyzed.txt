20251225 102013 It must be you, must be you So I listen when the bells start to ring and my heart starts singing I listen to the bells and they make me remember When we were so in love, it was only last year, this time in December I listen to the bells and I......pray my name I hear the Christmas bells but I'd never knew that I could miss you like this Love for you, lights and you, everything under the tree. Hands come around, celebrate, celebrate. They have a good time, but it's not a party for me. Love for you, sailor you, tail and back.
