That could have been disastrous. Oh my God, looking back at that child, I'm now seeing all the danger that I didn't know exist at that time. I was so naive that when I heard about rape, it just sounded like some sort of scraping of the skin. So I didn't know that I was exposed to those kind of dangers. Rape, physical abuse, I didn't know that could have been killed or raped. Thank God that didn't happen. Thank God it didn't happen. What was the turning point now? What was the point at which your life now took that turn for the better, towards hope, towards opportunity? Well, I would say when I graduated from high school, still not knowing what would be my faith. I know I had a passion for education and I wanted to further my education, but I didn't see anywhere possible. That was just a dream.
