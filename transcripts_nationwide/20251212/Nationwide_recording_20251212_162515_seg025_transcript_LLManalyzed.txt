At which point in in Iago school and them thing that needed to occur to you that yo, I don't know, maybe I could DJ. Um I wouldn't reach JC to be honest. Obviously. Obviously. Yeah. Yeah. When I reached JC and then I did start to meet more music-driven youths like myself, even projects. Me and them projects was in the same class. So things like that did kind of say, you know, I can try it still, because I did mess around with it over the time, Virtual Legion, them little thing there. And then when I did kind of brave up I start make mixtape I start print mixtape on CD so even though I live close to school instead of a walk go home go school I would have take the bus go straight off at 3 o'clock and give a CD on the bus
