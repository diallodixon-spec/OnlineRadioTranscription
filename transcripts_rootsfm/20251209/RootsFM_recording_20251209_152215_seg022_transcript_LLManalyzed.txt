============================================================

I love you and I won't be shy To tell you this marker right to your eyes How much I, I think I'm gonna cry. I will keep you moving, my girl. Grooving, my girl. If I can see your angel in your eyes. Proving my girl, proving my girl. Oh, I can see your love light shine so bright. Love is a gamble, but it's a game.
