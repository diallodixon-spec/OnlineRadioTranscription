I'm just saying to you people that this is the international dynamic and in any event understand that the powerful and the powerless don't necessarily share the same consequence when they do the same thing and those are my words from the black side. Join us next time for Orville's Views on the Hotline. Melissa. We share in your grief for the damages and losses experienced across our communities. In this challenging time, we stand firmly with you. Together, with strength and resilience, we will rebuild and rise again.
