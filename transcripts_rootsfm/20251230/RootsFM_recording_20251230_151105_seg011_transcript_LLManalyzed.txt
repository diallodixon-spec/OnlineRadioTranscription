20251230 151105 Let me tell you how I feel. It's all around done. You've been stepping out, running your mouth about what make you think I wouldn't find out. Was I not there for you? I truly cared for you. Maybe my love was just too much. Could've had it good, now the love is gone. Now it's back to your head with the 5411s on. Does he hit you with the fire in the back? Does he hit you on his gaming name? Does he hit it from the front to back? Did you let him break it down like that? Should've told me the love was gone. Should've told me, baby. Baby No more VIP, no more dough. We can't even kick it no more shopping sprees. No more late night creeds. No more VIP. No more dough. If you can't eat it, kick it no more. So now you want to add in an ad in the backseat.
