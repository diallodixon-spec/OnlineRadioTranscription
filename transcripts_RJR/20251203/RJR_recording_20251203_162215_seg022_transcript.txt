============================================================

Why the good times never last for long Where are we going wrong? Just once Can we find a way to find the meaning To make the magic last for more than just one night. I know we could break through it if we could just get to it just once. I want to understand why it always comes back to goodbye Why can't we get ourselves in hand And admit to one another We're no good without each other
