============================================================

I recall that we have had the opportunity of serving those who are paralysed because of the wheelchair program that we partner with the Latter-day Saints. Today, we have also shared in burial relief last year, and again this year, Church of the Latter-day Saints helped us greatly so far in bringing relief to those who were affected by Hurricane Melissa. We look forward to a continued relationship with the Church of the latter-day Saints as we continue to bring help to those who are suffering. We thank you for your partnership and pray that as we partner again in the Light of the World program that we will help to provide the needed resources for the people of Jamaica. God bless. Thank you.
