20251219 094722 The traffic setup that I've seen when they're fixing the road Most of these men they try their best to have some kind of guide with the with the direction of traffic not necessarily the policemen but them themselves and they coordinate easily and very well so I'm hoping that world kitchens or someone will do some Christmas dinners or Christmas food for them. Not for the working men, not the traffic, the people that are affected by the hurricane. Oh yes, that would be nice. Yeah, I'm hoping that there will be some charities, because I still feel like there's still people helping. I know it's got a lot quieter now, but I'm hoping that they will get some meals.
