So the minute you're finding changes in how you're feeling and how you're doing, reach out to somebody or find a counselor. Come and talk to us. We will assist you greatly in terms of helping you to understand how it's going on and all those things. Hey man, go sit on the wellness bench and take some breeze and talk to the lovely staff at Bellevue. Dr. Simpson, I do want to thank you but as we close, at the end of the day, suicide is preventable. We need to listen more, support more and act more.
