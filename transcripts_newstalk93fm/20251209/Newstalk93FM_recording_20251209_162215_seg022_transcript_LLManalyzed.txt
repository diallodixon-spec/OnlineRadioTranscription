============================================================

Locked inside my memory and only you possess the key no longer drowning and deceived all because you came for me locked inside my memory and Only you possess the key. No longer drowning and deceived. Oh because you came for me locked inside my memory and only you possess the defeat. Oh, Ophelia. You put a hundred on the land, the sea, the sky. But you'll leave just till you hit your hands. You'll see, you'll fight. I just care where the hell you've been. Cause now, now, now.
