20251215 193221 I wanna take you home with me tonight I wanna come and warm your lonely nights I wanna be wrapped up baby in your arms And I'm holding you so tight I wanna rock you gently till you sleep I wanna be the man that's in your dreams I would be glad just to know that you feel the way I feel We will feel by the end of the night Hold me baby, like I wanted to from the day that I met you Hold me baby, real tight girl And the chemistry was right from the day we met I'm afraid I'm not a day you'll find to stay
