20251223 200305 to you, cause I believe in the truth, and I just wanna live good. I don't want no dirty secrets fighting me and you, boy. I could only drive one car at a time, but I still want to. But I still want to, cause everything is balance. Right through life, all we want is balance. To be a good wife, all you need is balance. Bend I'll be your sunlight when it's raining. Stay together and we go in places. Yeah, yeah. I'll be by your side no matter the case. We have a one-way ticket to greatness. Greatness. You're not the one to lie. Because I believe in the truth. And I just want you to know.
