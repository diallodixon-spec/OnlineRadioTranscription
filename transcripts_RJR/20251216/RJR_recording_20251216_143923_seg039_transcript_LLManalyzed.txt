I'm glad you shared that. Because it is such an important point in your life, when you are finishing high school. And depending on your circumstances and your situation, there are several choices that you may have to make. Some people definitely may have to work because that's their situation. Some people, they have the fortune of having parents support to assist them to go to university. Others go to university without any kind of support. They just rely on some loans. You decided to double down on your family business, the tradition that was there, and I'm loving your attitude towards it. You said you gave it 100%. Tell me about the lessons you learned during that time of the doubling down.
