A lot is happening. I'm seeing here that one of our police stations has an outbreak of chickenpox. I saw that story this morning too. I know people who have dengue. You know, the ministry identified the leptospirosis. So guys We really really now have to be very careful and very cautious. You know history will tell us that post Hurricane yes, there is a lot that happens particularly where health is concerned and so we have really, really be very cautious and careful in just how we move about. We're not trying to scare nobody. But as I said, if we learned anything from whether you believed in COVID or not, if you learned anything from, and I don't know how you could not.
