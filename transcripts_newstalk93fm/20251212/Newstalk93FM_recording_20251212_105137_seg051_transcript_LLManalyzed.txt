20251212 105137 Don't let me down easy If you're gonna leave me, baby Go and leave me all the way Don't ask for all your things back Cussing out my name, yeah Just to go and take back what you say Burn all the the bridges. Don't ask forgiveness. Walk away like I'm someone you hate. Don't let me and huggin' Guess you're right, it's too good to be true Was the point, all I needed was you But time after time, I just fussin' and fightin' It's time that you do what you do And it's cool, mama said it was fishin' to see I got lost in the pool Knew it was comin', I watched how you knew How you turned your back on me and laid me to lose Remember the text, how you said that you knew Said that you'd never leave without me
