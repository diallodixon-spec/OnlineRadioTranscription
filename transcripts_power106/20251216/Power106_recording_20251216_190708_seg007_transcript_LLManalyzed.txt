20251216 190708 in the 2025 Caribbean Secondary Education Certificate, I've developed a real interest in understanding plants and livestocks and even technology in agriculture. I've developed an interest in how all of those work together. Honestly, I love farming. I just love anything to do with outdoors. I love farming, I love being active. Right now I'm raising some pigs and goats on my farm at home. I have a little farm at home. Jerson sees himself as a leader outside of the classroom and the farm, someone his peers respect and respect.
