ISIS will be there. Adira will be there. DJ String will be there. And me, Dwight, will make sure to be there all day from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. this Friday, December 12 at the parking lot of the Spectrum Management Authority at 13 to 19 Arbor Street, downtown Kingston. Live all day on Roots 96.1 FM, rooted in the inner rock and I move to the plus. We're not talking about career distinction. We're putting interstitial. We're talking about life.
