20251216 211307 You can't sit there! When the road is rocky, I'm still standing up When the road is heavy, judge is still guiding us Even though the sand of time will come and turn us to dust Faith, we'll keep on leaping, a secret jar is a must, yeah See the storm has come to our town All the trees and leave them all brown I'm telling the police to my sound We must rebuild and gain back our crown Turn on music. Big up.
