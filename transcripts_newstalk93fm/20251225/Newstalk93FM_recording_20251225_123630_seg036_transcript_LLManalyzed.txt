20251225 123630 I don't care, I don't care. I don't care if you don't want to. We're on the island. I tell you I'm good, I'm good boy. Don't pray for me, if I don't come home in the morning, just know that I say it's not in my place. But this mass of a hole in me, I can't come home in the morning Just know that I say it's not in my place But this mass of a hole in me I can't leave Until every single bottle down If anyone look it for me, then You can find me where bombs are shaking Higher beating, people fighting, so complain If they want to know, tell them You can find me out on the road I'm ready to walk, just the one Time to feel, carnaval won't let me go To send a search party to find me I out on the road, I like me Tell them that it's ok, I have me Take it, you will see me Wednesday
