2025-12-12 11:25:31 There's a place in your heart, and I know that it is none. And this place is much brighter than tomorrow. And if you really try, you'll find there's no need to cry. And this place you feel there's no hurt or sorrow. There are ways to get there If you care enough for the living Make a little space Make a better place Kill the world Make it a better place For you and for me And being and our human friends. There are equal rights. If you're caring enough for the little men, make a better place for you and for me.
