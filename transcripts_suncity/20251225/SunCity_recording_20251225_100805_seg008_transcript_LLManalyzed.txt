20251225 100805 Fill in for the Hello, Jamaica show, so you don't know. Quick and fast though, people. Remember, Christmas Eve, it's all about NYE, an ultra-premium event, and that's at 34E Tradeway Town Center here in Port Monson Catherine. I don't know, musical jug means by yours truly. Sun Jack Crazy Dean. Yeah, people, it's a food-inclusive event, right? Couples for only 10,000. If you are the single people and you want to go look somebody, six grand. You hear me? Food inclusive because you got jerk chicken on the menu. Jerk pork or goat, shrimp pasta, chicken pasta, hot steel soup. Mighty God.
