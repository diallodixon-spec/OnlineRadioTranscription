20251226 123120 Come on, come on, shout! Thank you Jesus, thank you Jesus so much. I love you more than anything in this world. You're the only one that's patient with me. You're so kind to me, Jesus. I really love you and I don't ever want to let you down. Alright, alright, oh yeah, everybody come just, just come around this piano here. Yeah, this little thing is kind of Andre style. Just, just, just watch this. Just hold, hold on, listen. Tree stand, see that the Lord is good, give child.
