20251229 174645 Mr. Jackson? Right, I reiterate it again, that the whole process of establishing Portmore as Jamaica's 15th parish started under the PNP government. What has happened since is that a Jamaica Labour Party government gave the commitment since Manifesto in 2020 and is now delivering on that commitment, right? That is the only thing that I can say makes it different that we are keeping our promise to people of Fort Moore. They will now have full autonomy. They'll be able to lobby, they'll be able to manage for their own resources and at the outside of the dictates of the census.
