============================================================

We could see showers picking up around 3 p.m. and that should cool things slightly to 31 degrees Celsius. The rain lingers into 4 p.m. however, with temperatures dipping to about 30 degrees Celsius. And by 5 p.m. we settle into a mostly cloudy evening at around 29 degrees Celsius as we move closer to sunset. For those of you who want to catch it, it's at 5.32pm, so be sure to set your alarms to stick your head outside and catch that beautiful picture.
