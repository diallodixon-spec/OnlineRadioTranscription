============================================================

I don't even know sometimes All I need is peace of mind Why is it so hard to find? When I am wandering Show by the way On this road that we're traveling Give out a faith Child, is my life through the darkness Whenever life seems the hardest Don't let them break us apart Each night I pray Though the world has its way. Try help us to forgive. Our enemies for all they did. Know we can't let anger and hatred linger in our hearts.
