2025-12-11 16:00:22 People who got damaged in the hurricane to get some housing or proper shelter, good health and peace among our people. That's one of my wishes as well. I would love for all the persons who were negatively impacted, can just find joy, can smile upon them face. Can go home, get a warm bed, get by them roof, get by them things, so and you feel good in yourself, you feel good. blank ambitious underscore tashani says light so actually is in one of those parishes that were heavily impacted unfortunately um somebody else says love food and god love that okay somebody says to be healthy um winston toka says healthy and no more killing just peace and love
