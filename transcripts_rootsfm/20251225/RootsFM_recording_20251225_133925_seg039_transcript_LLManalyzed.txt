20251225 133925 You're driving through Kingston. Who do you listen to? Roots of Air 9-6.1. Since you came in, I knew back then You were that special one I'm so in love, so deep in love You made my life complete You are so sweet, no one can beat Glad you came into my life You blinded me with your love, with you I am inside. You open me, I'm wide open. And I'm doing things I never do. But I feel so good, I feel so good. Why it takes so long?
