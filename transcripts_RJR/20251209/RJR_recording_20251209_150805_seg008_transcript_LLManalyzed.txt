This is reggae music. Light up the incense. Light up the ancients. Light up the lighters. Make a light of the world. Inhale the fragrance. Free up your mind and let go bad mind and make all evil get purged. Don't get caught in the roadblock. Everyone wanna count is the slogan yeah Love is the potion that confirms your notion That is one love I can deal with for sure Now is the time and the place for everything This is the time to free up your mind But it's so hard, everything Let the music take control of you. Give yourself freedom to do your thing. And play a party lighting up the world. And play a part in lighting up the world! The future can be brighter. This much higher, higher, higher!
