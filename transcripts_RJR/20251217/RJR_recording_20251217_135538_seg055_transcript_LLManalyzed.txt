20251217 135538 Oh, my amazing, amazing pastor Anthony and his amazing wife are the Reverend Joy Anne Murchison of the Jubilee Tabernacle Praise Ministry. 34 years, you know, they are celebrating. It's their wedding anniversary and wishing them a day filled with romance, love and thanksgiving. May your love continue to inspire and bless your congregation. It is coming from the Jubilee family, your son Johan, your daughter Toni Anne and your daughter-in-law Monique, and your wonderful grandson and missionary Jacqueline Williams. Birthday wishes to my niece Lydia Matthews of Days Mountain. She's celebrating her birthday today and also to my grand niece Zendia Palmer whose birthday was on the 13th. She lives in Galena St. Mary and is coming from Aunt Polly in Ocho Rios. All right, happy birthday to Charmine
