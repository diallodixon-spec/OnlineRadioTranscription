after a clash between a teacher and a student on the sidelines of one of the matches. Eyewitnesses say the confrontation began when the teacher confronted the student about his behavior in the stands. The argument reportedly escalated, resulting in a brief physical altercation before school officials intervened. The Inter-Secondary Schools Sports Association, ISSA, has requested a full report from the school involved. ISSA says it takes disciplinary matters seriously and will review the circumstances to determine whether sanctions are necessary. The association also reminded schools that adults are expected to model appropriate behavior, especially during high-energy matches. The students' parents were contacted and counseling has been arranged. School administrators say they regret the incident and will work to reinforce discipline policies. The match continued after the disturbance and security personnel increased their presence.
