20251223 183921 For me, the cost of my crown is free All I have to do is say yes Jesus has done the rest Imagine walking on those streets of gold Side by side with angels, time will be no more I can't wait to see his new scarred hands Then I humbly bow just to say thanks Don't have to beg my back for heaven Don't have to walk ten thousand miles Don't have to pave my way to see Jesus
