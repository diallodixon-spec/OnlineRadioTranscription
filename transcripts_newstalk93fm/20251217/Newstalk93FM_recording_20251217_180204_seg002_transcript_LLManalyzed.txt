20251217 180204 We could post up all the pictures you want when you're ready. I go over here, darling. You go over there. But we could beat in the middle and start a bacchanal. Play in the middle, hey. What we gonna do now? Jam to a rhythm in the heat said compromise on it. Baby, spend time on it. I say compromise on it. Hey, can we talk some business? You know I want your company. And it's nothing too risky. Limited liability. Don't worry. If you try all the things I like, you could still shy in the morning So don't feel away You don't like the fast life But look on the bright side, girl I go take the blame I just want you
