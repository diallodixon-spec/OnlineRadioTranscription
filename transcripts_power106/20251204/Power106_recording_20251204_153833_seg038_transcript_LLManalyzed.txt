============================================================

to do forms for you is really, it becomes even more a risk for you to do that, because if something goes wrong, you are then at the mercy. And often, of course, if you go with an Ontario to fill out the form, they're not going with you into the interview, so you're on your own. You're on your own, and I am always very leery of taking cases where a paralegal or an Attario did the paperwork because you have to scrutinize it so much. You know, these people, they don't have any accountability if they've done something wrong. Oftentimes you can't even find them again. Wherever they were, they've packed up and they've moved on. And so you have to be careful about trying to save a dollar on the front end and then you spend a hundred on the back end. And also discomfort.
