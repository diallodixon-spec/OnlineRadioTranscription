2025-12-12 12:47:37 You're listening to Sleek Radio, 93 FM. I'm moving in the morning Just know that I say it's not in my place But this mass of a hole in me I can't leave Until every single box is done If anyone will get for me then You can find me wherever I'm marching I am eating, people get it So can please, if they want to know Tell them you can find me out on the road All ready to walk, chest up full, time to free up Carnival won't let me go To send us a party to find me out on the road, y'all ready to walk? Chest up, hold it, time to free up. Carnival won't let me go. Go send a search party to find me. I out on the road all night. Tell them that it's ok, I have made it. You won't see me Wednesday. Go send a self party to find me, I lost on the road all right. Tell them that is ok, I am made.
