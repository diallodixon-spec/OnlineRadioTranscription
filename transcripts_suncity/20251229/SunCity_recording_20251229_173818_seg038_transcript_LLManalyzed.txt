20251229 173818 There was a Thursday thing, BEMBE Thursday, not the first BEMBE Thursdays with Richie Fieldings and Matt Aranda. It was revamped and restarted over by Escape 24x7. So you could hear Boom Boom, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday. I'm not sure if he had something on a Wednesday, but I know that he had something on Thursday, but I think he had something on Wednesday as well. I just, I just can't remember what it was. I just kind of remember. I know that you have Weddi Weddi Wednesdays, but I think there was something before Weddi Weddi or after Weddi Weddi. I don't remember. I don't know what it was, but for now it's Sundays, boom Sundays, hottest thing on a Sunday, uptown Mondays, hottest thing on Monday, and bossy Tuesday, you don't know. Yeah man, boom boom of those events, locked on a weekly event.
