water for domestic purposes. So a lot of water commission systems are from Wales, a lot of the irrigation systems are from Wales and so on and a lot of private systems are from Wales. So we tap into these aquifers. Now we need to have an abundance of rain as we've had pre-Melissa leading up to Melissa and then into Melissa into the system itself. What you would have found is that a lot of the water now soaks into the ground. Managing Director of the Water Resources Authority, Peter Clarke. Jamaica's limestone geology includes many sinkholes, which usually help drain water down into the earth. But when the underground system becomes saturated, the usual flow reverses. But even sinkholes that normally drain the water away are now becoming basically reverse funnels that are now offering that conduit, that pipeline, that way. I don't use the word pipeline because there's no pipeline. Offering that route for the water to come up into the community.
