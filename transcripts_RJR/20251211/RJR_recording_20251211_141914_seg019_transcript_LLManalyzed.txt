Come on. It's a lot of excitement happening here. Seventeen. Nobody could drive here in New Kingston. It is all about the Sagicor Kingston Biz Fair. And let me tell you, when you say Christmas, Sagicor is the Christmas and they're making sure that SMEs, small businesses, get a chance to feel the Christmas spirit as well. Good afternoon to my sister, my friend, Nicholas Speed, manager of SME Business Banking with Sagicor. How are you doing, ma'am? I'm great, Johnny. I'm great. Look here. I have to tell the people. She looks so good, but I can tell you, she's so busy. I'm so glad we got the chance to sit down and talk to you for a little bit. We can't stop you from moving up and down. Yeah, that's fine, because I have to make sure everything is perfect today.
