20251223 193631 I'll be there for you with anything you're facing I'll be your sunlight when it's raining Stay together and we go in places, yeah, yeah I'll be by your side no matter the case We have a one way ticket to greatness, greatness You're not the one to lie Cause I believe in the truth And I just wanna live good I don't want no dirty secrets fighting me and you, boy I could only drive one car at a time But I still want to, but I still want to And let me get to the truth, truth, truth I just wanna live good Know the sun could shine the same time with the moon Boy, I could only drive one car at a time But I still want to, but I still want to I always say, hey, set up yourself now Brace yourself now, this kind of truth
