20251225 164627 with an excuse to ignore God. Mom, I wanted to go to the mall. My friends would laugh at me if they knew I was going to church. Who me? I'll never die. Well, I will, but it's a long time from now. Between dealing with my kids, my aging parents, and keeping my job, I don't have time to go to church. Hey, my working years are behind me, and now it's time to start enjoying life. I know my time is short, but I'm too set in my ways to change now. Have you used any of these excuses? Don't put off knowing God any longer. He loves you now. Will you choose Him today? Another message from Lifeline Productions, located on the web at lifelinepro.com.
