20251225 200303 we share Christmas time again So alive again You can share with someone from the little you Let nothing spoil our mood They've got much but we're feeling good God has been so faithful It's been a long year We make it through, we belong here. Spending time with our family and friends. Christmas time again, no feelings in the air. It's an atmosphere of love that's what we share. Christmas time again. So alive again. You can share with someone from the little you So mama set the table up and we'll come over We make the rum cake and you just put coconut over And we go get the city up like it's a crock-over Forget the reason for the seasonal jeep-over
