20251218 130104 Power Producers IPPs are not in collusion with the Jamaica Public Service regarding the 7 percent bill increase attributed to Hurricane Melissa. This follows a call from opposition spokesman on energy, Philip Polwell, demanding that the IPPs publicly declare that they are not in collision with the JPS and to independently provide clarity on the increase in their fuel price. Speaking today on the morning agenda on Power 106, Dr. McKenzie said it is not unusual to see an increase in price to the end users because of high generation costs due to Hurricane Melissa.
