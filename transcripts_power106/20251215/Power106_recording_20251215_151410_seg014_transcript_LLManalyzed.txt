20251215 151410 where you have to get all your grades, all your marks. You have to fight for all the marks in two, three hours in an exam. Now the children can get 20% of the marks through school-based assessments, so they have no reason not to send in excellent SBAs, where at least they go in with a good 18% already. So please make sure your children do their SBAs. Talk to the school, go down there and check. Many of us on TikTok and YouTube and all kind of things. Spend a little time and go down to school in the holiday and find out if your sons or your daughters have submitted the SBAs. And in this Christmas time, let them study. A lot of you probably don't get back to electricity yet, but please let them study. Don't let the Christmas slide reach them and they forget everything that they have learned. Let them study. And the time we had without electricity shows that they're not going to die if they can't go on the internet. Let them check up. Let them book. Okay, don't let them tell you that they have to listen to this and listen to that because when they go into exams they have to read them because a lot of them are not reading. They are very slow in reading.
