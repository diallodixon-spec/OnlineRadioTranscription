Merry Christmas when it comes and enjoy your day. Thank you very, very much. Take it easy. Bless you. And you know what? And I return all of those greetings to you and all of your neighbors for the entire parish of St. Mary, but in particular, your little neck of the woods in Islington. Thank you very much.
