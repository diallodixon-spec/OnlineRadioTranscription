20251231 115233 I said the last time, but sometimes two huge boulders came down and blocked the roads there some years ago. So you're talking about what is causing it, what can be done to prevent it. I don't know if the engineers have anything or what is happening of the geologists who tell us. I know of another road, for instance, where you can have rocks coming down, which is also a danger. Not just rocks, you have places, for instance, with overhanging trees. Where it left there, I remember there's a fatality some years ago, where a tree being actually came and fell in a car. So there are perils, you're saying. So what is being done to, if not totally eliminate, but to reduce the possibility or probability? The other point about accidents.
