20251223 205443 I'm not faking this, no fugazi. You see these feelings, I'm not catching. I'm a shine your ego bright Fall like F for the night If you want to take I'm serious, I do talk speed No need to resonate, I'm on a different frequency. I don't think it's necessary. I be damned if there's somebody that could do like me. When I be like Mo Salah coming up the right wing. I call to your defender, you don't need to tell me. I'm all finesse. You know, say me I'm a snitch.
