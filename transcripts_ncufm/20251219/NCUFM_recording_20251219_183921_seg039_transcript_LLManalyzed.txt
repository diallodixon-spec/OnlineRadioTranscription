When your life has broken you, He cares. He cares about you. Oh, God cares. He'll be there to see you. When your life is young. When no one will come to you. Your body cares like he cares. God cares. Oh, yes, he does. Yes, he cares about you. He'll be right there. Take your life back from me. He'll care about you.
