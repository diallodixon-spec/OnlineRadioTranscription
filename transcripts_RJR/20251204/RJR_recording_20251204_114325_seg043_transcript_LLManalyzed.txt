Good morning. Good morning, who is this? Castro, Castro. Oh, Castro, yes. Oh God, what happened? You alright? I'm well and you collected the thing the last time? Yeah man, I did come over there and yeah man, thankful and give thanks and praise. Well, good to know. Yeah man, blessed, you know so. Yeah man, so really glad I had the opportunity now to talk to you and hear you say something to me. You can't hear nothing on your radio. Okay. Oh, the sun.
