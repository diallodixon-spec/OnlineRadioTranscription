20251229 094030 I think for the first 10 years, they didn't make any money. And he was always being asked by analysts. It was almost like they were goading him when they interviewed him. Why is the company not profitable? Investors need a return. And he was forever being badgered by this. And he always used to tell them he's not he's a long term this is a long term venture so the people investing Amazon have to realize that it's not the return is not going to be tomorrow right it's going to be down the road and so said so done so I think there is merit in a long-term discipline approach and it can significantly outperform the short-term reactive strategies that people tend to have. We would encourage you to start early, stay consistent, think beyond the immediate gains, don't invest short
