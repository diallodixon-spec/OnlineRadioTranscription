Here with all conscience, I represent, and this is Sun City. A gauge I represent, be gone. You know it's less than a K.A., Mr. Keebler. For want of them, they should know. I'm Etana the strong one, and you're locked into Sun City with the stars. Your favorite hits, Sun City 104.9 FM. What is Monday? come over Tuesday? Why do summers start in June? Why do winters come to soon? Why do people fall in love when they're alone?
