============================================================

A nice, real kingdom living. Two rounds before me, which one to choose? People's opinion made me confused. I've got to be deposed this time. I can't lose. I bite by the precepts and stick to the rules. Cause when purple stand up in your line, impossible divide, possible multiply. I'm stepping too high. It's my destiny. Cause I know you have something bad for me. I hear purpose calling, renew my mind, straight king of living. Purpose calling, stop the writing in, no more stalling. I hear purpose calling. Victor flies up, no more victim. I heard purpose calling, in this world about the system.
