I remember last week, Friday, we were here and I was trying to get some person to agree with me that the potter is not so ugly as people would think. And I never got many persons. But I bet I'll get a number of persons who will agree with me. Who will agree with me to this. Robin Redbress is a pretty little bird. I haven't seen any of those in years. When last have you seen a Robin Redbreast? By the way, you remember, I think it was in the 70s when we used to get birds.
