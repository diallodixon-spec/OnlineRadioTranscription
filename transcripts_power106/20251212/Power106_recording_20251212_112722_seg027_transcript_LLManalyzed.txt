2025-12-12 11:43:56 We you remember after they abducted the girl and and and murdered her We heard about oh we're putting in cameras in schools. Are we doing all sort of bollocks same nine days? I would love somebody tell me how many schools have cameras and upgraded their security. That's correct I bet you just another talk show. We need to talk to the education minister about that Well, she's the new one, so let's see what she has to say about it because... What she came and saw and what is the current situation. Yeah, yeah. Because at that time those comments were made by the current finance minister who was the education minister at the time. Correct. And the...
