I'm waiting in line. Nobody needs too much loving in line. It's as high as a mountain, but harder to climb. Oh, no! Nobody needs too much heaven. No, no. It's much harder to climb. I'm waiting. You're my love, you're my angel You're the girl of my dreams I'd like to thank you for awaiting patiently Daddy's home, your daddy's home to stay
