20251215 200305 I can take the heat and slow down Baby, baby, I like your ways When you're ready, hold on steady With you by my side all the time. Lying close to me with your body next to mine. Girl, I feel so fine. Slow down. Because I can't take the heat, slow down. If you slow down, I can take no heat. Slow down. Oh, yeah, oh, yeah.
