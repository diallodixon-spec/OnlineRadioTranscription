20251226 161616 As long as I receive The message you're sending Fire to fire, soul to soul Always feel you're near So say the words I long to hear I'll tell it to my heart Tell me I'm the only one And is this really love or just a game Tell it my heart I can feel my body rock Every time you call my name Love, love on the run Breaking all the rules
