20251223 201816 We have placed some questions there for you. I guess, Doc, you want to find out how long ago was the surgery? Yes, because there is a time frame usually that one needs to be aware of. Usually, if there is nerve injury from an injection or from surgery, they would say that it would generally, as long as it's not bad enough, it would generally improve over time, but after you've gotten to about a year after the injury, whatever is left after about a year, usually that's all that you will get back. So it doesn't usually improve beyond what you feel about a year, after the procedure. So I just wanted to know how long ago it was that they had it, so we can say whether more improvements is likely or what the case is. But there are things that sometimes can be applied or employed to assist, so it would be good to hear from that person.
