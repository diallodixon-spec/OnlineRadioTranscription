I still believe that you love me, baby I still believe That you can, darlin' I still believe, that you love me Baby, I I know I've done you wrong Cause you are now the love I'm reaching out to you Just listen to my song Girl, I apologize For treating you so cruel I took her for granted No more pain No more loneliness Lonely days No more stress No more pain, no more lonely nights, lonely days No more stress, no more pain, our troubled times Gone away, all because of you
