20251217 143629 as it marks 25 years of commitment in recognizing heroes within the Jamaica Constabulary Force who have been making strides in communities in which they serve. And I have to say that I'm so happy that Mr. Lascelles-Chin saw the good in the force, and you're now the force for good. I extend gratitude to Professor Hamilton and the family of Laska Chin Foundation for their unwavering support and your faithfulness in service. During a courtesy call in October, I know we were delayed a bit, Melissa put us off, but I'm very happy that we're here, Professor. We met our finalists and having heard their vision and their mission for the communities they serve, all six finalists had one common vision.
