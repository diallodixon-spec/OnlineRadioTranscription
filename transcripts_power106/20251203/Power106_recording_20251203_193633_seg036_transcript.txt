============================================================

I've served as coach, I've served as player, administrator. I've served as delegate. The first time I was delegate was at the 2004 Olympiad in Calvia, Mallorca in Spain. And then in 2006 in Turin, Italy, I became a judge on the World Chess Court. It's called the Ethics Commission. I was led by an Italian judge at the time, Roberto Rivelo. He's now a court court of appeal judge, and I still serve with him on the constitutional commission of the International Chess Federation. I was elected to that body in 2018. And again, when that Congress was elected, Batumi, Georgia, formerly a part of the Soviet Union. And so since 2018, I was the first person from this region, especially of African extraction, to be a vice president of the international government body. So the thing was to get the main country cemented across the world and widely recognized.
