Tonight, gotta leave the nine to five up on the shelf And just enjoy yourself Ooh, let the madness and the music get to you I ain't so bad at all If you're livin' on the shelf Tonight, gotta leave that nine to five above on the shelf And just enjoy yourself Living up above, let the light of the sun and the music get to you Life ain't so bad at all Tonight, you got to lay the night above On the sun and up above and just enjoy yourself.
