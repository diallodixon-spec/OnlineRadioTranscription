A minute ago, Coach talked to Jamaicans all over the world and what message would you like to send to the supporters of Jamaican football? Yeah, I think first and foremost, I think we need to continue to come together in all aspects of our football, men and women of the country. We're going through some things right now, but our strengths are resolved in our unity. We have to continue to do that. We really appreciate the support we get. We felt that on Sunday morning waking up to all the congratulatory messages that we received from the people in Jamaica and the diaspora around the world. And then I had to continue because that is what drives these players to go out there and put on their shirts and represent their country the way they do. So may that continue and I'm really grateful for that.
