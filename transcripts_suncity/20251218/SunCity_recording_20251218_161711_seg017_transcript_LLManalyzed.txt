20251218 161711 Hey, it's a girl, she's in a big group, Ali Patch. I had to be a fool To yell out what we were through And now I'm all alone And feeling down enough babe When I never knew what this could be It was so, so crazy on me Sometimes we say things that we really don't mean. Well, I'm sorry, baby. Bring your loving back to me. I can't sleep it.
