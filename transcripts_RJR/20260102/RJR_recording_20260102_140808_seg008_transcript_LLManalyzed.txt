20260102 140808 I love you Mary Jane You're the prettiest of flowers, girl, I can't complain When I'm with you, I feel so high, I rise above the rain You know the people down beside us No, I leave them lonely, feeling only pain Cause your DNA is of the highest strain Your affect is so potent, it's so insane Juice of gummy and stick you like a plaster stain you grind out your body, only stems remain. And to love you is so risky, I might get detained. You always keep me playing on the highest plane. And anybody know will always proclaim. Your medication, your medication makes me happy.
