20251222 165639 Many of us have life, but not much else. Some of us are still being housed by the state, and the far-reaching effects of Melissa on the economy are just now starting to be felt. Raise your hand if you were nervous about having enough eggs to make a Christmas cake. Good news, though. Prime Minister Dr. Andrew Holness is reassuring Jamaicans that there is no ban on festive celebrations this holiday season. Speaking at a Christmas treat for shelterees at Petersfield High School in Westmanland recently, Dr. Holness emphasised that once the events are properly organised and aligned with public safety requirements, there are no objections to Christmas celebrations. The Prime Minister cautioned that promoters looking to stage events in communities still facing infrastructural challenges after Hurricane Melissa must address several practical considerations. The police have said that they will give permits for parties so long as the promoters make the proper arrangements. Some places don't have the lights, so if you're going to keep parties, you have to put up lights.
