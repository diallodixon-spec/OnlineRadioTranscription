20260102 212722 of the commercial banks following through? So, I mean, it's really both. The commercial banks will tell you that the reason they have not lowered rates, because when interest rates are higher, their liabilities on their balance sheet, so customer deposits, would have been more expensive. So they have to wait until those liabilities will roll off the balance sheet before they can start to lower rates. That's just one of the things in the monetary transmission mechanism that they have not, that militates against the immediate rate reductions filtering through. On the BOJ side, I agree with the decision to have held it in the last quarter, for most of 2026 I think gradual rate reductions over the period would be appropriate in the circumstances. I don't think it's going to be necessarily aggressive but the signal I think to the rest of the market now needs to change.
