Well, today is a good day, gift and saline All praises to the Lord, I see a form of sanctify No need to stress me, me a wall of vines With red moon, T.J. and moon in me bone to fight On the night that's around us, in darkest around us In blessings around us Niggas are gonna show me Oh, oh, oh, oh For me, I come from another journey Good thing God got me, fear that you'll feel it For me I come from life as meaning that you'll keep on believing
