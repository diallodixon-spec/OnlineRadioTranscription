20251231 134120 Thank you mama for the nine months you carried me through All those pain and suffering No one knows the pressure you some times, you maintain your calm, I was your only end While sheltering me from the storm And when it's cold around me, the towel's wet Thank you mama for the nine months you carried me through all those pain and sorrow
