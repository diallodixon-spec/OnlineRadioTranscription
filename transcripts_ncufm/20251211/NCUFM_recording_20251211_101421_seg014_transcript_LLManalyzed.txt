============================================================

Those nail-pierced hands Reached up to God and down to man And just as if I'd never sinned He took me in His arms Embracing me He willingly forgave A mercy, grace, and love That knows no bounds. Though guilty and condemned, I know I'm free. Forever I'm forgiven. For Christ the Lord is risen And risen with Him we shall one day be Oh, hallelujah!
