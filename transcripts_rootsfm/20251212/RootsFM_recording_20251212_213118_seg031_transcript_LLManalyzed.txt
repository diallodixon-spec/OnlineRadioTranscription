20251212 213118 I'm a fool without no money. So foolish is the man in fruitful desire. I tell you, keep it. Cleanse your ways. Clean up your poor ghetto youth. No bother, guys. We say, oh, no, first we start. Babylon must speak soul and heart. Them done dead, them peace, and no heart or hope. That's why we come. We try to run away. And then we try to break away. So if you see me in the youth center and in church, I heard me to kink kink kink. It's a lousy way. Well then, you see, the prime ministers know what I got wrong. Had them sell out the youths to the queen of England. The whole of them happy bow when them see me turban. Me drop every authority fever be wrong, melt every death harder, never yet wrong. When we turn to niabing, it be the Black Redemption. We're not careful of your words and before you and yam. From the youths grow, them wolves are carbonization. So bubble hill, better wolf decentralization. And never a sell-off season.
