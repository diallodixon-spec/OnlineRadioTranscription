============================================================

I knew I had to have you My heart said there is no time to waste I want your love Won't you give it to me, baby? I need your love Everything I've got to carry Love's coming at you My love's coming at you Straight on and full speed ahead Love's coming at your My love's coming to you Wanna make you mine Oh, mine I keep them pistol, baby The nights we make sweet sweet love I can't stop the waiting, I have to go with what I'm dreaming of.
