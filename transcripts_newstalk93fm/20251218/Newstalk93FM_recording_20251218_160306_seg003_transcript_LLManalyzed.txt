So pray for me, if I don't come home in the morning, just know that I say, it's not in my place, but this man's have a hold on me. I can't leave, until everything's down If anyone looking for me then You can find me where bomb was shooting Higher beating, people fighting So complain if they want to know Tell them you can find me out on the road
