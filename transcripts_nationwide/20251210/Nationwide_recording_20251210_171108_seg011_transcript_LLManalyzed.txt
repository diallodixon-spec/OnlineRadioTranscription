We were told that JPS required $250 million and that the government would be loaned in $150 million as that number being revised. When the presentation was done by the Minister of Energy, we did not have the details. The Ministry of Finance is lending to a body corporate on the basis that that would be some part payment for the complete sum for the restoration. So if the Minister of Finance is going down the road to lend this money, the Ministry of Finance ought to be able to say that they are satisfied that the full money for restoration will come ours. It is just your loan down the wicket.
