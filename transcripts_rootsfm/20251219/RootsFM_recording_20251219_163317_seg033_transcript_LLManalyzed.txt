20251219 163317 I need to chase the tracks of my tears I need you Need you Need you Since you left me and you see me with another girl Seeming like I'm having fun Although she made me kill you She's just a substitute because You're the permanent one So take a good look at my face You see my smile looks out of place If you look closer it's easy to chase the tracks of my tears. I need you. Need you. Need you, need you. Ooh. Oh.
