20251229 093925 Remember now that some of the issues and response to the issues will come even after a vote is cast. Some things that come up at the time of an election, you've been on the radar. You understand? So you want to be so careful that who you're electing, that you assess what their demeanor and stance is globally. Let's take a point about knowing the news and what have you. But it's so much to expect of the average voter. The average voter is going to look at what's happening within the local and want to vote accordingly. And we see afterwards sometimes voters get what they call bias from us. But I hear you on that. But it's always good to try and make yourself aware. All right, Liz, thank you so much for your call. I appreciate it. All the best to you. All right, you too. Stay safe. All right. Bye-bye. Let's take another call. Good morning. Welcome to Hotline. This is Clyde Mullings. Good morning, Ross. How are you doing?
