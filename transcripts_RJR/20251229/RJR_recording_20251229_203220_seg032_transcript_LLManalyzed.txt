20251229 203220 It's a Jamaican double threat as Orlando Bennett and Tyler Mason storm through the barriers to lock down second and third. It took a world record pace to beat them. The sprint queens fight until the very last metre to bring home silver, adding yet another chapter to Jamaica's legendary relay dynasty. The goal by Dejaune Whisper-Richards at World Cup Football Qualifier versus Bermuda. He came off the bench and turned the game on its head. Dejaune Whisper-Richards dances through the defence and buries it. The goal by Ronaldo Cifas at World Cup Qualifier versus Trinidad and Tobago. Blink and you'll miss him. Ronaldo Cifas turns on the jets, leaves the defence in the dust and fires Jamaica one step closer to the World Cup. Horse racing. I dream again winning the Jamaica Derby.
