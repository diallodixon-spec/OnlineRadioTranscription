We want to get into something here, which I find particularly interesting. Let me start with you, Senor. Race to recovery, or motorsport, became humanitarian power because something of tremendous significance happened whilst you were fighting for a European country and you found yourself fighting for something much bigger. The country itself talked to us from that perspective. Sorry, you just broke up. Were you asking me something? Yes, I was asking about this race to recovery now. Well, Montesquieu became humanitarian power. I want to get into that, additively. Please. For sure. For sure.
