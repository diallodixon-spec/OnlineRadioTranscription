20251230 134530 I don't want to be there It's been so long since I've touched a floating head I can't put my love on the line That I hope you understand So baby if you want me You need to know me now Now that we found love, what are we gonna do? One, two, tell me what you got. Let me strip my foot inside and slap the hip and jackpot. Wrap me up, wrap me up, my little water cup. Freaky touch, hug her up and get stuck. Believe it or not, here comes a brother with a pro. A snugglin', bubblin', overweight love, I'm huggin' bros. So what's it gonna be? You can take time to set your mind and your body free. So watch as you stretch, stretch, stretch for a sec. Play while the problem's locked.
