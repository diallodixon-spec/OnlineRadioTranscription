20251222 110607 in computer-based management information systems from the University of the West Indies, Mona, Jamaica. And both the postgraduate diploma in education and the Bachelor of Science degree in computing and management studies from the University of Technology, Jamaica. So I want to say big up to the University of Technology, Jamaica. I'm also an alumni of that great institution here in Jamaica. Dr. Faisi is our guest today, and she comes to us with over 20 years of experience in higher education, and she considers herself as the intersection of technology and education. So I want you to help me listeners out there to welcome to Beyond the Prescription, Dr. Lisa Facy Shaw.
