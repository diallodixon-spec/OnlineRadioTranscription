20251217 202527 I don't want a lot for Christmas There is just one thing I need I don't care about the present I only need the Christmas tree I don't need to end my stocking Live up on the fireplace Santa Claus will make me happy With a toy on Christmas day I just want to own my own Oh Ooh, ooh, ooh, baby Oh, I won't ask for much this Christmas I won't even wish for snow And I'm just gonna keep on waiting All the way in the mistletoe I won't make a list and send it To the Lord for myself
