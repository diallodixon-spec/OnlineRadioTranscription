20251224 151306 again to me it would be a pleasure if it don't take all my ledges away so when I fall in love it will be forever cause I'll never ever fall in love, when I fall in love I wonder if one day that you say that you care If you say you love me gladly I'd gladly be there Like a puppet on the street
