You do what you want So when you're ready, you can try and follow your heart and never whine about who I like And if you try to run the line And you don't try to stop me vibe, so don't say You do what you want, do what I like You ain't have to get no change When it comes to party I ain't such a man And I know when we come to party we don't have a plan You don't tell me why I don't want you Why I don't know you like me We doing me your thing So when you ready you to drop and follow your heart and have a bite and follow your heart
