20251231 195326 Happy faces, good times When I'm hanging with these friends of mine Sing this line a thousand times I will say friends and I will say family Genuine love and adios I will say life so we're living up Happily, genuine love and adios Celebrate your good friends Put your hands up in the air and sing Oh, oh, o-oh, o-oh Celebrate your real friends Put your hands in the air and cross Good friends, oh yes And good, good listeners, we are all family dogs. In March, from New York, say Happy New Year when it comes. Loud and clear. And when you win the celebration, I don't hang around the door.
