This is a special management program. This is a special organization. This is a group of people who are in this area. This is a program that's going to help them in their lives. It's a family-oriented program. It's a community-oriented program. So that's going to be the day of that meeting. So we're going to have a fun time in this special management program. It's going to be the day that we're going to be fighting for the full life of this country management office. And we're going to have some time tonight to demonstrate what we can do to get this done. And then we're going to do a little bit of information. And I'm going to introduce everything we've said so far. So we're going to take a few minutes to introduce ourselves. There will be blood pressure sprinkles on the test. And then to the testing, we're going to sign a few minutes to recharge. There will be blood pressure spreaders on the tits. I'm going to check the tits to see if they're fine and I'm going to test them to see if they can resist some of the pressure that's coming from the tits. And I'm going to assume that the curvature of the tits are fine. And I'm breathing air through the tits. Breathing air through the curvature.
