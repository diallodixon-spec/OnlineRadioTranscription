This one's for all the politicians and them. In your face, they must smile up. Behind your back of money, they must pile up. Try to start your business and them quick will spoil up. Well done, well done, Mr. Politician Man man. You done a wonderful job until you're done with country demolition, man. Sibili Bang, well done. Well done, Mr. politician, man. You've done such a great job selling out the country with your business plan. Well, you forget a round of applause for all the work you're doing. This isn't where you make or leave the country in ruins, yo. Strictly personal gain you're pursuing, so the tax rate higher than the planes where you're flowing.
