So the election, the constituted authority could not have ignored this pronouncement and chose not to send it to the election court. So having done that, and we challenged it to say that judicial review is the method to compel them to send it to election court. And the court was given the opportunity to evaluate the evidence, the mountain of evidence, to say look at this, all these breaches that took place, how could they constitute an author to ignore these breaches and refuse to set up the election code? Now the fundamental error made by the judge in this case is this. Time does not run against annulity. That's fundamental administrative law. Once something is deemed to be annulity, it is regarded as void ab initio. So time does not run until the decision is properly made. So when the judge talks about delay, that's absurd. You can't delay when it's annulity.
