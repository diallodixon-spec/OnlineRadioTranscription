20251223 120104 us more engagement while on air. Yesterday's Roots FM was good, and we aim to make tomorrow's Roots FM even better as we continuously reimagine, recreate, and redesign according to your desires. And while we give thanks, let us remember those close by who may not be as fortunate as we are, as well as our brothers and sisters in Western Jamaica who are struggling through the season because of Hurricane Melissa. Roots FM would not be possible without you, the listener, and thus we encourage you to keep your dials fixed on 96.1 as we entertain and educate, while giving thanks and praise to he who we recognise this Christmas.
