20251216 132117 You wasn't down for me But now I see I even heard it from your family How could you call up all the names that you used to call me How could you, how could you just forget about me How could you teach your mom the things I taught you How could you put them up to the ghetto promise you'd try How could you put me in my back again, in my front seat How could you how could you, just forget about me? Girl, tie me up and let me come through your speakers Blow the sound out of your tweeters, cause baby Girl, this is the music for life Don't be shy, don't be scared, just let the bass party A chip on the wall up in your 16 Cause baby, girl, this the music for life Girl, up above the sea, just float through your body Get this party started
