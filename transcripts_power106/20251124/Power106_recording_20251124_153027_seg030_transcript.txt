your host for today. Thanks to Jessie and everyone at PAW 10 material. Store material in approved containers and well-ventilated areas. Use caution when handling candles, matches, lighters, and potential fire starters and never leave them unattended when in use. Keep them away from curtains and other flammable material. That was a fire prevention and safety tip from your friends at Power 106 FM.
