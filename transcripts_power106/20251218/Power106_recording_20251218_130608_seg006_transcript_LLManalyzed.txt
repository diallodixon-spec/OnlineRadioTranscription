20251218 130608 Yes, I was there for the coffee. I'm always going to farm shows. Wherever the shows are, I'm always there to give support. Because you're in Lawrence Tavern, presumably you weren't terribly impacted by Melissa. Surprisingly, no. We were impacted not with physical structure, but when it comes to the farm section, we were impacted. What about rain? Rain and breeze and so on. I lost most of my fruit trees. The plantings and banana trees all went down. The farm was ravaged, but the house that stood for the most part. And you started the farming again? Long time, because right now, I see where pumpkin have started to push up based on the whole vines that were there and I've planted like okras and they're about... What okra grow on? A vine? No, it's a tree but it's not big it's a tree okra grows on. We are laugh after me but you don't even know what okra look like.
