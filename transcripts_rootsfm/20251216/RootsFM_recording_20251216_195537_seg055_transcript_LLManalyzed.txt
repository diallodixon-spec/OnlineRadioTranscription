Yes, I know little bit of people go out of them way. Go out of them way, but I will care for you and I will be there for you. Even when your blue skies get gray. Yes, I will care for and I will there for you. Nobody listen when nobody hear say. A long time, never try break me up, but together we stay, together we stay. They mash me up, yes I know little bit of people go to them way, go to them way. But I will care for you and I will be there for you, even when your blue skies get grey. Yes I will care for and I will be here for you.
