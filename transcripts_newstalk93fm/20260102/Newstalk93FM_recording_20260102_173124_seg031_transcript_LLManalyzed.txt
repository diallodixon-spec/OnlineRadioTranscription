20260102 173124 I said five in the morning, I wake up to five of my year. If you're in my mind is a warning. Pray to the one you're relying. I've been wandering all day. I tried to be fine, but I can't be. The noise in my mind wouldn't leave me. I tried to get by, but I'm burning. And behind my mind it runs. All these thoughts are of traveling Fighting to give up my pain Fighting to be on my lane My mind running to the other side When it's time to leave my life Then it tries to take me out, tell you why
