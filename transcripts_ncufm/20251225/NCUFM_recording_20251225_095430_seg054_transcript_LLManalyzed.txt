20251225 095430 I'm still here. God, help me in his arms. Protect me with his hands. That's why I am still here. Oh Lord, I am still here. See you wake up in the morning, started on my knees, thanking my Father for shielding me. Though my burdens are heavy My trials are great But I have a Savior So I live by faith
