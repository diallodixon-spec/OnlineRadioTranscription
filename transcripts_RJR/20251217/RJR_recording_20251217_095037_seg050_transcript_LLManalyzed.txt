20251217 095037 We have to replace our televisions at this point in time and there are some of us who want to. We are encouraging you when you're going to the store and you see the television that you have had your eye on to take a picture of the barcode and or the ID number, especially the large televisions. We want you to look out for any fish line or herringbone cracks that may appear in the corner. The reason we're saying this to you is because when it is time for the television to be delivered, you want to be able to match the barcode and the ID number with what has been delivered. Because sometimes it is switched. Really? Well, before it comes to you. So make sure, make sure that you take that picture.
