20251219 120205 details on the court rulings when the written judgment became available. We'll have details on the court's ruling when the written judgment becomes available later today. A St. Andrew-based real estate developer was yesterday freed of fraud charges in the Kingston and St. Andrew Parish Court. Devon Evans was found not guilty of fraudulent conversion and obtaining money by false pretenses after Chief Parish Court Judge Chester Crooks ruled that the complainant's evidence under cross-examination had fallen apart and left the prosecution's case in a state of uncertainty. The charges stemmed from the sale of a townhouse to the complainant, Dr. Lloyd Golson, in 2008. It was alleged that after making a deposit of over $400,000 on the townhouse and taking possession of it, Mr. Evans failed to deliver the registered title.
