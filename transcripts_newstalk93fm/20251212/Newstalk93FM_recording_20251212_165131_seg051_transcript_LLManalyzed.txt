Right in the middle. Say no to the thing. Deep as the blue sea, love me really and truly And even though the suns will come, no we won't rock Just love me, deep as the blue sea I've seen many but I still pick you just like a fruit tree Look in my eyes, what do you see? I ain't see happiness, me and you are kick it like me
