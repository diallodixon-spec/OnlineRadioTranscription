Oh, what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh Dashing through the snow in a one horse open sleigh O'er the fields we go, rappin' all the way Hey! Bells on bobtails ring, makin' spirits bright Oh, what fun we're gonna have tonight, singing my songs right. Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way. Oh, what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh.
