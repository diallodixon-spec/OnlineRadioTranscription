So come on, come on Let your body move to the music Hey, hey, hey Come on, come on Come on, let your body roll down the floor You're with you Get into the groove So you get to prove your love to me Get a head on your feet Yeah, step to the beat Oh, what will it be? Music can be such a revelation Dancing around you in a sweet sensation We might be lovers if the rhythm's right I hope this feeling never ends tonight Only when I'm dancing can I feel this free At night, I lock the door that no one else can see I'm tired of dancing here all by myself Tonight, I wanna dance with you
