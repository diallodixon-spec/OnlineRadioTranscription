20251224 132112 Search for you when you want, search for me. Taking care of each other is common courtesy. Want this life without the memories of all the elements for you to grow. No one ever said it's gonna be easy, but still I got to let you know that it feels so good and baby girl, I love you so. And I will never leave, I'll never know goodbye is not a single word we'll say. No final goodbye.
