need everything that I would love to do and where I'd want to be and I mean when I think Christmas you think love yes it's a celebration of peace a lot of us celebrate you know Jesus Christ and and everything the whole religious side of it but I'm also big I'm a sucker for love and Christmas represents love for me happiness joy happiness joy and everything so I wanted to envision myself like a Cinderella I wanted to have a little Cinderella moment sorry so I wanted that long beautiful gown and and glass slipper type of vibe you know with you know so it was really that just just a girl in a fantasizing world thinking thinking joyous and thinking happy, really. Wonderful, wonderful. So My Christmas pushes you outside your comfort zone as a singer. What new side of JoJay and Pantry are fans here?
