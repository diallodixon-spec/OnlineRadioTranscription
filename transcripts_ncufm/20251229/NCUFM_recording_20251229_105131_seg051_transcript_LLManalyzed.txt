20251229 105131 is over every time I pray. No one else has ever cared for me like you, Lord. Other friends can never be as close to me. I'm not afraid to face the problems of tomorrow Knowing you are everything I'll ever need I'm amazed that you love. I'm amazed. Yes, I am, Lord. How You care. Through Your precious blood. I found pardon. Oh, I found pardon. And my sins are washed away.
