20251216 124124 Don't overdo it. It's easy too. It's easy to grab that cake from every single house. Very much. On three or four cakes in three or four days, don't overdo it, drink plenty of water, still exercise, even if it's cold outside. Definitely. Thank you so much, Dr. Mandy. I hope the listeners are taking heed. I will myself. Thank you. And I hope you yourself will also take heed. That is right. All right. Thank you, oh, oh.
