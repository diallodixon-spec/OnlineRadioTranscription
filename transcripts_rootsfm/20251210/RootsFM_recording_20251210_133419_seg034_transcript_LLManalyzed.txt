All right, so more musical, so it's a love love line. It's fine I can't imagine living without you Without you My world would just stop spinning Without you Without you Floating on a cloud each time you say my name I wanna scream out loud, you're driving me insane Driving me crazy baby Each time you fall, I wanna fall Deeper and deeper and deeper Each time we kiss, I'm feeling it deeper
