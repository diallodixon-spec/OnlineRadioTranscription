So happy birthday pastor Scott and happy anniversary to you and your wife Armada coming from sister Zarina Wallace-Wilson and all the members of the Church of God. Seventh day in Hayes Corn Peas, settlement Clarendon with lots of love and the Wilson family will love you both. Happy birthday to you.
