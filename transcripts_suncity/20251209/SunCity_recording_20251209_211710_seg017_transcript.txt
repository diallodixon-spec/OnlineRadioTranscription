I guess I had to flee Now it's sex in the city and a couple little fling Motorcycle man had a hand for me Like to rush to the tunnel and I break next week Computer boy toy, he was fun for a while Till I caught him on the web hacking other girls' styles You know the guy say what construction turns out He was moving them pounds to cost them They wanna settle down but I just don't trust them They wanna love me down but there's no handcuffing'd be together, but you didn't say forever. Now I guess this is whatever till the twelfth and ever. I've never been afraid of love. This world like I'm dangerous. I'm looking for that dangerous side. Looking for that danger. I'm looking dangerous. I'm like, I'm dangerous. And that's my time. Looking for the danger inside I said I like I'm dangerous Oh yes, I want someone to step to me Oh yes, I need someone to rest for me Oh yes, and I've been afraid of love
