20251225 094321 You've got to be surprised, babe. The truth is stranger, so is the danger. I gotta let my spirit be free to admit that I'm wrong and then change my mind. Sorry, but I have to move on and leave you behind. I can't waste time, so give it a moment. I realize nothing's broken. No need to worry about everything I've done. Let every second like it was my last one. Don't look back at a new direction. Mmm, stare.
