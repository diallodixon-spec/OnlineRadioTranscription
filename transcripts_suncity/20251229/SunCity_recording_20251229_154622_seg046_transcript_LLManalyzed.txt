20251229 154622 I played a song last night, and I realized something. I realized something. Yes, in the song it says, I close every letter with love always. You know which song I'm talking about, Johan? Tell me if you know which song. Because she closes every message with love always. And when I heard it last night, when I was playing that song, I was like, yo, Johan came to mind because she always close her messages with love always. Johan, you know which song I'm talking about? Which song am I talking about, Johan? I know you know this song. I know you know the song. All right, let me see what Nix says now. Nix I'm begging you not to tell me how to talk. Why can't I tell you? Nick, Nick, why can't I beg you to talk to me a little bit softer? Why, why, why? Man them, man them, talk to me, talk to me.
