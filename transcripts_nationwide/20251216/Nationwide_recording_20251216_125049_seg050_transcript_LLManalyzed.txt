20251216 125049 was there doing the tidying up. And no, they would not have let us in because they're going to, they are strict on visiting hours and they're not going to let us in to say, okay, get your mom cleaned up. According to only one person was on the ward who was doing that. And I'm like, okay, fine, I can understand. But at least clean her up and leave her and come back to her. But leave her more than eight hours in it? No, ma'am. No. And trust me, Mr. Hughes, it's more than that. There's a lot of things happening down there but everybody's keeping quiet. Nobody wants to speak up about it. Wow. Nobody wants to. How long your mama's been at KPH? And when did this happen? Yesterday was it? Monday?
