20260101 162223 When I was supposed to see. Taking it easy when a friend told me I was in danger. So much danger. Underestimating my woman, not taking her out. Working too hard and now she's going off with a stranger. Someone I don't even know. I should have taken her out every once in a while Dinner together on the fancy star Show her a life that's all worthwhile Now I guess I gotta walk an extra mile I could beat myself, oh yeah Ooh, yeah I could beat myself Oh yeah, yeah I I'm gonna feel funny out there in the crowd When my friends all ask me where is your woman Long time I don't see how I've got it
