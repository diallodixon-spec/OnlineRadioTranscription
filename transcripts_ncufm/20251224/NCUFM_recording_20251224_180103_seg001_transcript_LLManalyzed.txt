20251224 180103 It's now time for the evening sports report here on NCUFM. I'm Dawson Ho Sang. We kick off with football as Manchester United forward Ahmad Diallo scored the decisive goal as holders Ivory Coast opened their 2025 Africa Cup off-nations campaign with a 1-0 win over Mozambique and Marrakesh. Aiming to become the first defending champions since Egypt in 2010 to retain the title, the Elephants dominated the first half but wasted several clear chances against opponents ranked 1-0 second in the world. Relief came four minutes after the restart when Ahmad capitalized on static defending, meeting Franck Kesey's knockdown with a calm low finish to secure all three points for a mercy phase aside. The Ivory Coast will face five-time champions Cameroon in their next Group F match on Sunday, while Mozambique meet Gabon in Agadir. Meanwhile, Riyad Mahrez scored twice as Algeria cruised to a 3-0 victory over 10-man Sudan in their Group E opener in Rabat.
