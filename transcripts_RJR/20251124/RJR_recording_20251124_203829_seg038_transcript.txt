============================================================

Lonely, so lonely when you're lonely. Oh, so lonely. I can't take it. Alone in the crowd on a bus after work, I'm daydreaming. Down next to me as this woman on his arms, my arms are empty. How does it feel when the woman that you love says yes, she loves you? It seems unfair when there's love everywhere and yet there's none of you.
