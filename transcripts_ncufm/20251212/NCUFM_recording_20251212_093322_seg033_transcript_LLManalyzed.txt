2025-12-12 15:24:39 When my enemies try to hurt me, I don't have to worry. I'm in His care, not just here, but everywhere. I go to that hiding place where I seek my God's face. I find the strength to go go on Don't you know, don't you know He carries me All the mountains high He comforts me To the valley low When I'm going through the storm I'm protected in His arms Oh Father don't know what I would do without Him.
