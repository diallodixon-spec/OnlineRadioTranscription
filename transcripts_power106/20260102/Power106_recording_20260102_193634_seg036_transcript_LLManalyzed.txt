20260102 193634 26 would be interesting to see how he fares against the top riders on whichever circuit he goes. He shall see. So this dark authority is expected to win. Now then, who will chase him home? There's another deputant here. This is Victoria Slings, but here's the thing. She was expected to make her first appearance on the 19th of October. I can't remember exactly what happened. I think she was injured prior to race time at the gates. So the vet was an officiating vet then, but then she has brought extremely well in preparation for this and she's going to be a huge threat to the winning aspirations of number one dark authority. Anything else in the lineup that we can look at? Number seven, Abudar did show a little bit of ability when beaten though by his stable companion, Mohan Lal, and could get a little bit closer in this event. But dark authority and victorious links looks as though they'll fight it out.
