And we'll be playing them right throughout the day, much as we did on Christmas Eve, playing all the Christmas carols. On New Year's Eve, we'll play some conscious music that might be a little uplifting to the soul going into the New Year. But you know, the reality is the New Year is just a new date. It doesn't really signal change. It does not really signal anything unless you put your mind to it, your shoulder to the wheel, etc, etc, if you want to make a difference in your own life. But then why wait for a new year? Why not do that at the start of a new day?
