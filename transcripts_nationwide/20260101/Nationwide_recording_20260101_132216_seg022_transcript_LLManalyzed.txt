20260101 132216 Escape to another world Live for another day I'm a whole day dreaming now We spend our life in the rain Every day feels the same We're not awake in the morning, no, no We feel like our work is done And set away for the sun But it's hot in our eyes We spend our life In the rain, every day Feels the same, we're not awake In the morning
