like a spray spray pan you know we would have to go fetch water every single morning 5 a.m. and and go get those cabbage and halaloo and all those other three months crop watered after that we would have to take care of the animals especially the cows we would have to milk those cows and distribute the milk and run back to the house and get ready for school at eight.
