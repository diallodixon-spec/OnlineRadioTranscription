Like I'm part of it Oh, our time, no fears, no lies As soon as we're part of it You know we're gonna be gonna be golden We're gonna be, gonna be Wanna be, wanna be glowing Like every nanonori You know that it's the sun time, no fears No lies, as soon as we're a part of it I could be the twist don the one to make you stop The icing on your cape, the cherry on the top There's heaven in my heart and we could find you some space
