I just want you close to me Stay here, keep my company Don't you worry that this is late Cause you are here to finally end my lonely day tell me where i'd be without what you love Maybe you would still live with your ex Maybe you would still be free to live Maybe you would be really desperate to get a real Batman figure Maybe you would be still free to live
