2025-12-12 09:25:05 okay you're sweeter than a beach but you don't know the life of a show girl babe and you're never ever gonna wait the more you play the more that you pay you're softer than a kitten so you don't know I took her pearls of wisdom hung them from my neck I paid my dues with every bruise I knew what to expect do you wanna take a skate on the ice inside my veins they ripped me off like false lashes and then threw me away and all the headshots on the walls of the dance hall are of the witches who wish I'd hurry up and die But I'm immortal now, baby dolls I couldn't if I tried So I say Thank you for the lovely bouquet
