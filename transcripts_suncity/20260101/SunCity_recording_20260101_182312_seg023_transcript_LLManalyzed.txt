20260101 182312 I'll make it up to you. Good test. Heard through this world was wrong. Good test. I'll give my all to you. I'll teach this world a lesson. And I'll never let you fall. Here we are, the two of us together Taking this crazy chance to be all alone We both know that we should not be together. Because if we found out, it could mess up both our happy home. I hate to think about us all.
