20251222 162315 Don't try to change me Cause that's who I am I will love you I can't stand alone In this world on my own Defenseless in the light Without you on sand I stand I'm human that I am There's no power without you You bring me joy in the morning My eyes see your glory I know whatever might happen Give me strength to pass my test I can't find love where there is hate. You have the key to open the gate. My strength is nothing without you, without you. I mean, you know me, what I do. When in my room, I'm me.
