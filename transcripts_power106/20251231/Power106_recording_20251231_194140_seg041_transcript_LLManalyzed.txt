20251231 194140 This is the Miracle Man Cup and it is the teacher event and I can't spend too much time on this because no matter how you lose, the former horse number six of a revolution, ran for the first time on the time, ran in Jamaica for the first time, seven-year- little horse, did win and looks like it will win again, because although he's said to carry 126 pounds, the others are much too close to him in the handicap. And in the weight, he don't call it handicap, it came in the weight allotment. I think he'd be able to get this done at the expense of number one. Digital one was who was a distant fifth in the Mute Mile. So with a good break here, it could be the threat of a revolution, and we don't see that. Gam Dofano, one of his legs in the Mute mile as well, comes back here and has his favourite rider, Hallydeen, up in the saddle.
