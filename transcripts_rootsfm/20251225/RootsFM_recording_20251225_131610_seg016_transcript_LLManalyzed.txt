20251225 131610 was born today, and man will live forevermore because of Christmas Day. Mary's boy child, Jesus Christ, was born on Christmas Day. Our shepherds watch, they flock by night, they a bright new shining star They hear a choir, sing a song The music seemed to come from afar Heart now healed, the angels sing A king was born today And man will live forevermore because of Christmas Day Hi, this is Nichelle, and when I'm in Jamaica, I listen to DJ Fart on the Rooms F.
