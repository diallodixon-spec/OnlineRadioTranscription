20251224 092321 I'm fine. Good morning to your listeners. May you have a Merry Christmas when it comes. And yeah, glad to be here. Thank you so much for being here. We so appreciate you being here. And this morning, you know, when we talk about the Massacy Communities, it takes, and I believe it will take this show, another show, another one, and another one, and so much more. Because the Mustard Seed communities have been doing so much for those who are most honored in our society. And of course, as the consultant of the Master's Seed Communities, you are seeing and you know firsthand, you know, about the activities of the Master Seed Communities.
