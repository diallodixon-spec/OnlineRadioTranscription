20251222 094019 Listen, good morning to you, my dear. What's your thoughts on the letter? I want to hear that. Good morning to you. I hope you're doing well. Happy holidays to you as well, hon. But what's your thought? For me, if you had that conversation with him and you said, listen, when we have an argument, you just did some really out there stuff and telling me that I'm unattractive or telling me that, you know, I'm too much because I'm sharing my thoughts with you. Uh you and you said it to him before and he's still doing it. You need to exit. Jojo, I must wait for you to send the the writing because I did the next letter but I'm waiting on your response on the share we already have. yeah for me it is adult like loot up on a scooter you understand me yeah adult Jojo's the lady told us how his words make you feel which is not good your partner is a coward for not
