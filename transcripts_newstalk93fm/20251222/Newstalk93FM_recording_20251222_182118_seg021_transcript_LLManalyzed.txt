20251222 182118 So many people won't lick my stool, so baby, you make I serve your tools. And if I undo your two by two, you fit to scream, you can lose in your food. So many reasons are written in the stars, oh my god, you're the reason I do what I do. So baby, make you give me your love. Make you give me that love. If you give me me, I'm not gonna let go. Give me me, can't give my sample. Feelings got me hittin' on the freaky dance floor.
