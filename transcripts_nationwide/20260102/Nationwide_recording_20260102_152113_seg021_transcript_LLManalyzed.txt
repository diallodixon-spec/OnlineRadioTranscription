20260102 152113 lives dear. You see if you love somebody if you appreciate somebody and if you tell them too dear because you don't know. And so we'd like to extend our sincerest condolences to the family and friends of award-winning sports journalist and a friend to the show Donald Oliver. It sounds so weird to say this. The entire media fraternity is in mourning because what? Yeah it is such such a sad news. Donald and I, we've worked on a couple of projects together. And as you've said, he's somebody who's always been championing for this show. He's always been applauding us and he's somebody whom I even spoke to, I think, a couple of days before he passed. You did? He sent me a message about a video that I posted on Instagram and he whatsapped me and what was supposed to be a comical video like he showed me or he was expressing to me how much that video felt to him.
