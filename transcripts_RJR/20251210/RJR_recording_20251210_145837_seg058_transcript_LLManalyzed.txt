The last message I'm going to keep on stressing the point over and over and over again because I want our women in Jamaica to understand the well-women visit. Visit a gynaecologist once a year from the age of 21 all the way up until the end of life, right? That is my personal message. Just nothing has to be wrong with you for you to visit your gynecologist. That's what I want women to enter 2026 with. Have a positive outlook and a positive attitude towards your female healthcare, right? And I can be found at 3D Gynecology, 23 Tangerine Place. I'm on all social media. My handle is at drdaryldailyobgyn. My personal email is ddailyat3dgyny.com and I answer all emails. Thanks a lot for having me.
