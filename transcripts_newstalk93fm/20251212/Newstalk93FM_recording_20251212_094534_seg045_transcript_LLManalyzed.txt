20251212 094534 Now I'm not trying to preach to you But it's a fact we ignore the truth Getting dragged around with our rules Do you see See how we're falling See how we're stalling, stalling Don't you feel like a movie one big bad exclusive would make evil a use. All I'm pulling, just like a peanut moving. A big bad exclusive will make evil a use, don't be used.
