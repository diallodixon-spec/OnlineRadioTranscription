20260102 182009 And I see my family every month I found a girl my parents loved She'll come and stay the night And I think I might have it all And I thank God every day For the girl He saved my way But I know the things He gives He can take away And I hold you every night That's a feeling I wanna get used to But there's no man as terrified As the man who stands to lose you Oh, I hope I don't lose you
