20251225 105841 I've been drinking more, the past five days Did you check on me? Now did you look for me? I walked in the room eyes are red and I don't smoke banga Did you check me Now did you notice me? Nobody will know the pattern of your world Cause I put a smile on my face If I said you can never face And if you don't know me well, well, well You won't see how buried I am inside
