I would say, for one, probably... I'm sorry, you're your best friend who is probably saying... Well, yeah, you need to get him commissioned. He's the catalyst.

And they were the ones who really pushed. And thankfully it happened for me. First of all, when you got your degree, what was that moment like when you realized that you're done? It was an exciting moment. I let out a big sigh when I realized I was done because it was four years of non-stop work.
