20251229 183125 I confess that it's working, lady. Cause you got me so addicted, I can't get enough of you. Baby, you, you turn me on. Love it when I'm in your arms., just hold me Kiss me Put it on me, baby I love your eyes, I love your thighs When we meet between the sheets And I love the little thing you do When you stick your tongue between your teeth Your Your lips kiss and my neck weakens my knees. Don't you you shine now, baby, like a hundred degrees. You'll turn me on, baby, till the break of dawn. Baby, you'll turn me on.
