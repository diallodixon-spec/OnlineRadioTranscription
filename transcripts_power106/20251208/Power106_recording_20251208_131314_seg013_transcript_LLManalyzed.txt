Sir, you have 90 seconds. You have 90 seconds. Okay, so let's start. We're going somewhere. So do not recognize the treaty, which means let's have the discussion in Parliament and get rid of the treaty. Is that what you're saying? And then what next?

What I'm saying is, the descendants of the Maroons, I have no issue with them. Which are your relatives right around you? First of all, can I say something? Re-educate the children of the Jamaica. Stop associating them with honor. Oh dear. Because in Jamaica, they taught me that the mums were brave. No they're not!
