Hi, good afternoon and thanks for having me. How are you? I hope that you are also doing amazingly well. Yes, you and your family as well. Now, let's just jump right into it. Firstly, what prompted the Credit Union movement to mobilize so quickly after Hurricane Melissa? All right, so the Credit Union is all about family. We are people helping people. So after Hurricane Melissa hit, of course, it was in our nature to respond. And we decided, okay, we really wanted to get to the people as soon as possible. We would have realized that most of the efforts were, you know, persons were going to St. Elizabeth, they were going to Black River. So we did some assessment on the ground and we decided to find the community.
