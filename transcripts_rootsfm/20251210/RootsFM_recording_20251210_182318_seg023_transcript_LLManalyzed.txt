God bless me stressless, got a song got to sing, come go nothing ever trim, me heal up the king, cleanliness is godliness, that is all I bring, happiness and loveliness, peace flowing in the wind, as the birds keep flying, my meditation growing meditation growing God works to perform that is my calling my people give a naze and need my warning holy faith keep trying I know you will win though your cup is full and flowing at the brim give thanks and praise life is worth living yeah free up free up my people, free up on yourself. Stabilize, mobilize, galvanize on yourself, yo. Free up free up my people free up on yourself, no badda. Mix up yourself and go corrupt yourself, no! Free up free up, my people free up, on yourself. Just love and care and share some of the wealth.
