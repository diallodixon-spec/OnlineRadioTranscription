20260102 133718 Well, today's a new day. Give thanks to life. I'll resist to the light, be safe and sanctified. No need to stress me. We are Friday! With bread, food, tea, chair and moon in my bow and find. And the light is around us. In blessings around us. God of Brightness! Come to come to blessings. Yeah.
