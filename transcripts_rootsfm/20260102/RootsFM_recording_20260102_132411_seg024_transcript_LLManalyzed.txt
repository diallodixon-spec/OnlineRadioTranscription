I know'll never let us down Oh, oh, oh, never know Any times I coulda picked up a gun I coulda go out the street and played it down That's no fun, no Sure ain't no fun, oh, no What would happen if the other man thinks the same? Then bullets fall, I pray. It's no fun, no. No, it's no fun. Oh, I see greed and I see selfishness. Every man is for himself. Only you give thought to them, Father.
