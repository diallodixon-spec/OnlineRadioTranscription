I don't care, I don't care Don't care, don't care So pray for me If I don't come home in the morning Just know that I say it's not in my place But this mass have a hold on me I can't leave Until every second but to that If anyone look it for me then You can find me where Bamba says shit I am eating, people get it So complain if they want to know
