20251222 161811 I've seen you cry and I know why Maybe it's not treating you right But I've got what you're looking for, girl Right here So step into my house of love and Have the fear I promise you will never shatter. Love the deep. If you take my hand. Take you to a land where we go far away. Far away. Where there's no more pain. Where there's sunshine and the rain, we'll go far away. We'll go far away, so take my hand and let's go. I know.
