20251216 090722 Oh, forget myself put on this dark up till dusk I see good friends gone, girl we're did close I just like let nature take its course You're what hurt me the most But then we stick to the dream cause we've been close Think me would a deader in a jail by now You ain't got me fired up Say I'm here learning how to talk through I mean I ain't nobody if you talk through Just me, myself and and then my shadow lights up it's the darkest time for me lights up light to unsolve but i just can't feel lights up
