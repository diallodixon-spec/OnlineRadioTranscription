20251223 163926 Some people you write And them still choose to show you hate Run them out of your yard From them a play back young They ma bag bite us People critical to sideless We call them modern day Judas Spreaders of rumors Who dem a bag bite us? So why should I be afraid of you? When you bleed just like I do? The more you try, fight, judge, a light keep shining through. So I've got no time for you. Cause in my view, you wanna step in. I'ma show you we should never live alone. Feel so damn confused. How every day you wake, you hate, because you know you're fake. And every step you take, I bring you closer to your grave. What I am like a columnar.
