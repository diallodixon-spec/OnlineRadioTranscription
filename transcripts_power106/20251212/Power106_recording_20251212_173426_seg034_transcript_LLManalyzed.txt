20251212 173426 is when you see we don't play is when they gonna say you won't take a piss but that's when we won't hit that's when you gonna see it already too late and all you create blow up all in your face so I set my own table take my own space you won't take our place better start with your grace cause I've seen them break all the rules so even when they win they lose and I know it's true I see them looking all around Foreign, far around Every country, every town Calling for the sound Searching where can it be found Let them know I've got it now And it's right here on the ground I do this for my culture, for my heritage Gram speed to Morgan and my relatives How they rob my mommy in the 70s Not a cent, not a dollar, not a benefit So how you finna ask me if I'm ready?
