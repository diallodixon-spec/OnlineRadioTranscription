20251222 101109 I personally feel I'm willing to give up Christmas and to make sure that the little blind people, the little people who I know somebody, I'm trying to get a mattress all the way into a cascade for somebody, them on the ground, and them put on sleep on one part of the way they are to keep out the rain and think no man and I cannot even get a transportation to take a mattress down to them. All right well as I was about to say and as we ponder this that the election of what you want to, when I say another politics, what you want, when I say election is your choice, the choices that you make will be informed by what you think is important. And also about banning of Christmas and so on.
