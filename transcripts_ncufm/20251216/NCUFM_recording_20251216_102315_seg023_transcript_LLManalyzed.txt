20251216 102315 or ideas of Christ how many but do we really know him the one who came and died just to give us a chance at life the one who loves me who ain't passed unconditionally I don't wanna live another day not walking in your will and I don't wanna sing another song you think has praised you all day long I don't wanna be another girl walking blindly in this cold world Day in, day out, we call upon His name Yet through our very own actions we cause Him so much pain When will we really learn to give our hearts to Him?
