That's where this controversy started from. Take good care of yourselves everybody. You know how much it means to me that you learn from this program. It is important and that is why I take a stand when people say things that are erroneous because young people listen to the program and they need to be guided. I want to thank Grace Boston. I thank God for what she's doing in the Grade 7 Academy at Holy Trinity High School and I hope other schools will begin to focus on literacy. I want to also say thanks to all my listeners, my callers and everybody who participated today and I want to say thanks always always to my program assistant and engineer there Chandel Forbes and my producer Davin Thomas I see you again all tomorrow God bless take care of yourselves
