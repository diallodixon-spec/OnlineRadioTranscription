20251231 091009 So bring a case at the room Careful you don't drop it, it go break on the ground Family a come and everybody watch out We not go fear till the back and all gone Party time till the morning come Me love it when you jiggle it up for me How time that you give me the property Let me live in your fantasy Sweet gal, gimme jam, gimme jam And if you coming down for this season Oh, yeah. So my girl, you got the wine for the season. Back it up with the wine for this season. Sexy gal, when you bubble up your race, and you're mashing up the place with the wine for disease, all right? Bubble up your race so you're thicker, so you talk. Y'all, we love to move when you get in the dark, hotter than death.
