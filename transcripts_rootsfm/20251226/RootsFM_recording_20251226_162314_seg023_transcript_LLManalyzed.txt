20251226 162314 So line up the blood for the church, I got your body, make everybody jump like grasshopper. Girl, we bust enough, we cuss enough, but we touch enough. Love it when you wind, when you must launch. More time, more than cut, you know. Boy, your body make me stop like a bus, you know. One bag of this, one bag of that, but as we buck up, you must take it down. Oh, what do you do? So line up the blood for the charger, yeah. Your body make me body jump like grasshopper. Girl, me want your whole lot of water, fuck.
