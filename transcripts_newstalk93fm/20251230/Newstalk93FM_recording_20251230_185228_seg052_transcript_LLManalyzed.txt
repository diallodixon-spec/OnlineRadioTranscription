20251230 185228 Don't let me down easy If you're gonna leave me Baby go and leave me all the way Don't ask for all your things back Cussing out my name, yeah Just to go and take back what you say Burn all the bridges Don't ask for forgiveness Walk away like I'm someone you hate Don't let me down easy If you gonna leave me, baby, go and leave me all the way If it's over, it's over, so f*** it Just don't act like my love wasn't nothing Like I wasn't the one you was holding that night Telling all of your secrets to hug you Guess you're right, it's too good to be true What's important, all I needed was you But time after time, I just wasn't in fightin' It's time that you do what you do And it's cool, mama said it was fish in the sea, I got lost in the pool Knew it was coming, I watched how you knew How you turned your back on me and laid me to lose Remember the text, how you said that you knew Said that you'd never leave, we would fight till it's due But as it went on, I was fighting for you
