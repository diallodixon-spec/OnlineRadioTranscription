Oh, little baby, sweet darling It's calling, it's calling I want to tell you Oh, I seem to be falling It's calling, I'm falling Yes, I do It's calling than just a passing Ooh, where's your smile? Where's your smile? The highest of ecstasy drives me down. Drives me, drives me, drives me. If I lose it, I won't forget it forever. Say I love the way I love you.
