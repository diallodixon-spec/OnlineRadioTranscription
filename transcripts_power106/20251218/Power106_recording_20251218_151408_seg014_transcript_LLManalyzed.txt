20251218 151408 Yes, Sonia, come in. I see you, I see you. All right, so we've been pulling in our friends and everybody from off of the street and out of their business places to come and buy. Sonia just rolled in, and I know she's going to shop till she drop. She'll go and walk around and buy something from everybody and location here. That's the way to do it, right, Mr. Thompson? Certainly. All right. All right. So, Mr. Thompson, that collaboration is a very important one. This is how you turn friendships into something that is active and something that works and something that gives back. As a matter of fact, she was originally trained in agriculture and then she branched off into medicine. And so we have that synergistic approach. But one of the things I should also note is that she is running clinics in the western region and we have had a few and we will be going in some communities. I think we will be in Cave Valley next Monday.
