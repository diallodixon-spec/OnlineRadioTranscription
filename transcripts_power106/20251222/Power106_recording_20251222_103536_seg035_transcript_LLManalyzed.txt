But you are going to apply to them though? Huh? You are going to tell your members to try and get some money from them though? No, I think there is some money somewhere rather than at TBJ that come January morning we're going to be focusing on. We don't know if we can get some but I think Yeah, man, vital infrastructure. This is one of the main drivers of the economy. And they should get it. I just believe so. And come the first, second week of January, we have to focus on that. Right now, we need to be there at the 16%. And we can arrive there whole until January. The minister also said come January. So we're going to put him to the test in that.
