You're listening to Sleek Radio, 93 FM. Baby, ah, ah, baby, ah, ah Look, I don't need a rich To somebody that can make me feel Safe, yeah, look Out there with a couple But nobody ever made me feel Safe, like you Facts, cause when I'm with you I just know I'm fine Know I'm fine You take all the pressure off my mind All the time Patient and kind will not be going out my mind. Say from the problems, I don't worry, because I'm hard to find. I'm from the block, baby. It's you and I, baby. If the world turn against me, who I got, baby? I set you up, baby. I been a flock, baby. I'm talking.
