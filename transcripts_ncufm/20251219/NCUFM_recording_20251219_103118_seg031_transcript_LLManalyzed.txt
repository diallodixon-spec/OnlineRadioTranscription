20251219 103118 How can I ever learn your compassion? Covered and clothed with Christ for my fashion. Turning aside I feel godly sorrow. You confidently secure my tomorrow How can I truly show that I love you How can I truly say how I need you How can I really share, really share what I'm feeling? Can I really feel my heart as I am kneeling? How can I truly share?
