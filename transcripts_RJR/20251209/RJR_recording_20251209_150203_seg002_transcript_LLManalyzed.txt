The centrist candidate in Honduras' knife-edge presidential election, Salvador Nasralla, has accused corrupt people of manipulating the vote count in the Central American nation. Nine days after the election, the Electoral Council has still not decided a winner, but the latest results suggest that Nasser Tito as Rufa, the conservative candidate backed by the US President, has a narrow lead.
