20251215 141008 No chimney smoke, no bells to chime. Just the clock above my head ticking in time. But your bright eyes lights up the room all right. You're my holiday. You're my star tonight Sorry Santa, I don't want to waste your time Give someone else a present, I've got mine Got everything I need right here with me Merry Christmas everyone, wherever you may be I don't need a stocking or a fireplace Cause I have you to put a smile on my face We have each other like the moon and star You are my Christmas, yes you are I don't need the present or a glowing tree
