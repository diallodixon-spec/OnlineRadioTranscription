20251217 191310 was also have Dr. Brian James in the class as my best friend. Both of us from Montbe High School, you know, and we basically, you know, we're best friends. It's still, we are still right through. Studied together, argued about everything, fight about everything medically, which made us stronger. And when we, when we fought about how we interpret, how we interpreted anything in medicine, it made us research it more and then made us learn it more. So it worked. When I finished, I did my internship at Spanish Town, went back to Morant Bay to work at Princess Margaret Hospital. So how did it feel now going back to Morant bay now? You finished med school, you're now doctor, you know, and so you're coming back in a position of respect having gone through all those difficulties and have Ms. Higgins now look to you to help somebody else. What was that like?
