20251226 135242 You I don't want a lot for Christmas There is just one thing I need Don't care about the present Underneath the Christmas tree I don't need to end my stocking Live upon the fireplace Santa Claus won't make me happy With a toy I Christmas day I just want you for my own More than you could ever know Make my wish come true All I want for Christmas is you
