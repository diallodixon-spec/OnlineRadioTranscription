A total of 36 witnesses were called to give evidence for the prosecution in the trial of Constable Noel Maitland in the Home Circuit Court in Kingston. The trial started in May. Immediately after the prosecution closed its case, defence attorneys indicated that they intend to make a no-case submission, asking presiding judge Leighton Pusey to dismiss the charges. The lawyers claim that prosecutors have not made a prima facie case against the policeman. Maitland is on trial for murder and preventing the lawful burial of a corpse. He has pleaded not guilty to the charges. Donaldson was last seen alive on July 11, 2022, when the cop reportedly picked her up at her mother's home in St. Andrew. Her mother, one of several witnesses for the prosecution, testified that she last spoke to Donaldson the following morning.
