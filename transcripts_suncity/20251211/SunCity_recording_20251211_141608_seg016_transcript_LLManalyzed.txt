Never look back, we said How was I to know I miss you so Loneliness up ahead Emptiness behind Where do I go go and you didn't hear all my joy through my tears all my hopes through my fears did you know still i miss you so much From the bottom of my broken heart There's just nothing I'd do I'd like you to know You were my first love
