20251225 123423 Angel Gabriel appeared unto Mary and said, Peace be with you, don't be afraid. God has been very kind to you. You will give birth to a baby boy and you will call him Jesus. He will be God's own son and kingdom will never end. It was to be the birth of Jesus Christ. Not long after, an angel also appeared unto Joseph. Harken now unto my voice, he said. Fear not to take unto thee Mary as thy wife, for the child conceived within her is of the Holy Spirit. And so it came to pass that Mary became pregnant.
