school that child will tell you that oh I'm so happy they're doing it. We're not any worse off. Shame on you man. Dr. Gale are you saying that it takes a little under a month for the government to come up with a plan to evacuate those people who are marooned and is living in such terrible conditions. No Metro. Mic up Metro. Call the program Metro. You're sending me a few texts well now. Call the program and let's talk. Because that's not what I'm saying. I'm saying if you listen to people who work in the area of disasters, it takes some two weeks, two to four weeks of just running up and down, running up and down. I have seen it before. The matter of people being marooned and be there for three, four weeks Metro, that's a different kettle of fish.
