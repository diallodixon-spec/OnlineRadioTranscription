============================================================

So listen up, don't make a fuss. Your talk is cheap, you're not a man. You're throwing stones at your hands. But they say the sky's the limit, and you'll be the spin-through. But my printer hasn't seen nothing. There's a way to argue, because I'm bad, I'm bad You know I'm bad, bad I'm bad, you know I'm bad Let's go, I'm bad I'm bad you know you're bad I'm bad And the whole world's not the same right now I'll tell you once again. Say you'll hit me once. Help me to remember. Baby, please hit me once. I want you to remember.
