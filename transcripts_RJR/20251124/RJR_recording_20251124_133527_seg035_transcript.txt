The life of Jimmy Cliff. We can, of course, be proud that he is one of us. A man that loved his country, loved his culture. You know, I was sharing with a friend of mine that I literally grew up in terms of the soundtrack of my life. Jimmy Cliff is one of those artists that is at the pinnacle of those songs that I can remember as a child. Even now, right throughout my life, I could sing a Jimmy Cliff song.
