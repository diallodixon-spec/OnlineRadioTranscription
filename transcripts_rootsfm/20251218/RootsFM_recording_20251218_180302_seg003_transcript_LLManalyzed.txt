20251218 180302 I can't sit here while I go nowhere. Chase my dream through the polluted air. Walking on a wire, running out of life. There's no room in this so hard of mine. They'll collect us waiting down the hall. Baby, shut it up. Got to break it up now When I think about tomorrow Ooh, I can't wait to Set it up Got to shake it up now
