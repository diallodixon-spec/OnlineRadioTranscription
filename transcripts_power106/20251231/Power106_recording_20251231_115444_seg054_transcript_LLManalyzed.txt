I'm not so sure about the other bail because that bail that you, if you're speaking of bail given by a judge, then no, it wouldn't happen over the weekend because the judge wouldn't be sitting and hearing the application for bail on the weekend, which presumably is why station bail was given. What have I got here? Yeah. I keep sending you messages and put the name at the bottom of the message so I can see.
