20251222 162109 Salute to the one Admiral Bailey still doing big things in music. Work! Work! Work it! Carnival again! Carnival! Carnival! Juvé again! Juvé, Juvé! When I start to whine I have no control The carnival fever is in me soul When I hear them pan like a gun insane The carnival blood running in me bed I'll be charming
