20251216 150707 I'm on the plane now And seeing you is my aim now To hear you calling my name. Save your love for me and don't give it to nobody. I've been away from you for quite some time now. Every word I got me singing. Ooh, ooh, ooh. Yeah, yeah. Don't want to leave you again now. Ooh, Ooh, Ooh. Yeah, Yeah. You're my best friend, yeah. Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh. Yeah, yeah! Don't wanna leave you again now!
