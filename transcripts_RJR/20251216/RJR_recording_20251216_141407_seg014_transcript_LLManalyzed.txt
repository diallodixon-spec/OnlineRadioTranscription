20251216 141407 When you come around I get paralyzed And every time I try to be myself It comes out wrong like a cry for help It's just not fair Pain's more trouble than love is worth I guess forever It feels so good but you know it hurts But you make me wanna act like a girl Paint my nails in red for you. Make me so nervous that I just can't hold your hand. You make me go. But I cover up, won't let it show. So I'm putting my defenses up. Cause I don't wanna fall in love. If I ever did that, I think I'd have a heart attack.
