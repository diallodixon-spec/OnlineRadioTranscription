20251215 122817 We pray for wisdom Your voice to hear We cry in anger when we cannot feel you near We doubt your goodness We doubt your love As if every promise from your word is not enough And all the while you hear each desperate plea And long that we'd have faith to believe What if your healing comes to tears? And what if the thousands leave us now?
