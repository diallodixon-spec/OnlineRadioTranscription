Go down, go down, go down Go down, my girl, my girl They're yelling at the army when we step in at the party I wanna hop up on a yardie Watch me dancing on you Music is a lot I don't know I will be eight so I get low I know you want me higher so When I, when I'm fast, when I'm slow Only man say, girl I'm your fan so Love how you play go Love how you drop low
