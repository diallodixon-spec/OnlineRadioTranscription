We don't have to keep saying the passage of Hurricane Melissa. You know, Jimmy Kimmel does a thing, the late night talk show. And he will say, for instance, at the beginning of December, virtually every media house, every morning show, every discussion program, say, I can't believe it's December already. And he will play clips clips from every one of them and every one of them is saying the same bollocks I can't believe is December already so where you think it was eh? You did stop live after what January February March April May June July why you can't believe it is December
