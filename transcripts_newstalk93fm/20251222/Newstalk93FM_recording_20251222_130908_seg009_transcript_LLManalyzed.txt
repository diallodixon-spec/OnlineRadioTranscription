20251222 130908 Ooh, ooh Said I'm falling, falling, I'm falling As I lay my bed with my head to the ceiling Say I'm drowning alone and I'm lost in my feelings Somebody send me a sign cause you know that I need it Can't even come back to me Anxiety My remedy I tell you that we all need love Jump up and show me love When the punch on me love Together till we all need love
