Farmers across the island are being urged to register for available agricultural insurance programs as the country prepares for a dry period and continues recovery from Hurricane Melissa. Agriculture Minister Floyd Green says the government's partnership with GK Insurance has already proven its value with every farmer enrolled receiving a payout after the hurricane.

He highlighted that many of the farmers who received recent payouts did not pay any money upfront
