20251231 113933 spoke about the SSL matter. Well, Ruston and Herbert spoke about it on Monday and Tuesday. And I don't know that I can bring anything more to that issue until it's decided by the courts. I'll tell you what my gut feeling is based on our history in this country. I don't think, I don't think we're going to see anybody go to jail over this issue. There may be some criticism of regulatory mishaps or wrongdoing, but I don't think there's anything there that's going to result in anybody going to jail.
