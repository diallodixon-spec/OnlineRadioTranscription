It can be face value, excuse me, of me going to do this because this feel right or me feel like I'm going to do this. Because you know that we have those mindsets. You have some people that say me not take out no loan. I had a cousin like that. He said anything I do, I prefer to save up my money. And then I do it, I don't take a loan. And then there are other people who say, I use my money, I loan out there, I take a loan. So yeah, I've seen two sides of it, where there are people who are averse and people who are very much into taking it. I think there are two. So personally, I don't believe that there's, you know, in the category of debt that anybody should just think of all debt as horrible debt and stay away from it. There are two types of debt that I like to think of, which may be another thing. I need to check if that's another thing.
