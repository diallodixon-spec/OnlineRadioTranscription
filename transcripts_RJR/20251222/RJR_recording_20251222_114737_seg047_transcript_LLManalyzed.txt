20251222 114737 the credit unions of Jamaica are doing just that. I want to share with us some of the things that, you know, the credit unions are doing and, of course, the extent of the contributions thus far. Sure. All right. My pleasure. On behalf of the over one million members and the 23 credit unions of Jamaica. Now, when we were hard hit by Hurricane Melissa on October 28th, it was just something in our nature as a credit union movement, people helping people to respond in a timely manner. So we responded and went to Westmoreland. We went to Westmoorland, we went to southwest St. James, and recently we went to Darleston in eastern Westmoreland. And at the time when we selected the locations in Westmoreland, I think we went to Macklepine, we went to St. Farm Westmoreland, we went to Georgian Plain, and we also went to Baptiste, that's a small community in St. Elizabeth, and then we went to South West St. James.
