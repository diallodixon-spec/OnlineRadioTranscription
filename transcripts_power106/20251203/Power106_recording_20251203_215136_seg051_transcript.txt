============================================================

I'll always be here Just because I love you It doesn't mean you won't disappear And so long I'm missing you, baby Don't send me long memories once upon a time Slowly creeping on me, I'm an angel on my mind Just let somebody love you, I just don't know why Whenever I get close to you, you're the alive It's been so long, I'm missing you baby
