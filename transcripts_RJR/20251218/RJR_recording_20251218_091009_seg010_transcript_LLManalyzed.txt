20251218 091009 of hotline for the elderly in the east. And yesterday we had sort of an abbreviated version of it, but good nonetheless in the yard at 32 Lindus Road for over 150 elderly listeners to the hotline. But this year, because of Melissa intervening, we are in Grange. A number of people are owed thanks and gratitude for the mission today. So we thank you so much if you're in the environs and you can hear us. We're talking with JPS to see how soon power can be restored. But until such time, go and do what you have to do and you join us. The hotline. We thank you so much for joining us. We're happy when you come here. Happy when you find us.
