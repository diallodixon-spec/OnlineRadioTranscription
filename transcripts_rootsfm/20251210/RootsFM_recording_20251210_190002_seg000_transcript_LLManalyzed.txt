We have abdominal pains and cramping. Urgent bowel movement and for ulcerative colitis. It could be a bloody movement, bowel movement, blood in the stool. You can see that happening for ulcerative Colitis. Persistent diarrhea. So for days, some persons can't go to work, can't go to school because of this persistent diarrhea. There's also weight loss in many individuals, loss of appetite. So while they see the food and love the food and want to have this food, there's absolutely no appetite to have this food. And the next thing follows. If you are not eating, then you are weakened. You become fatigued. And that's really one of the major things that happens with persons who are experiencing this. Fever can also develop because, again, you're exposed to several microbes, bacteria, viruses that can lead to fever.
