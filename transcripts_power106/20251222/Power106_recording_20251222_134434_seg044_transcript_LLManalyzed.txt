You can't go to the custom office without an appointment. You've got to have an appointment to go to the Custom Office down there, downtown there. You can't just walk in, right? because I paid so much taxes in this country. I employed people here. I don't have to come here. I did not have to come back to Jamaica to live. I'm a United States citizen. I could stay there. I have a house there. I could live there. I want to live in my country. Why are they treating, why do we treat each other like this?
