============================================================

The race is not given to the sweet, not a battle to the strong. Daja a cover and a watch over me, so I keep on moving on. But vision is a warrior, protected in the most high shelter. And I know them naga, see vision falter. Me naga, stress out, pop down and look maga. Me say me fit and me healthy and me strong like a lion. I'm trodding to you want Even though sometimes there are obstacles You just gotta keep to keep on pressing on. Race is not giving to the sweet, and not about it to the strong. Yeah, yeah, I cover and I watch over me, so I keep on moving on.
