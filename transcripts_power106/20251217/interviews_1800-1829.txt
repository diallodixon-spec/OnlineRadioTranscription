**Interview 1: Director General of the Office of Utilities Regulations, Anzard Hewitt**

In a recent interview on Radio Jamaica, Director General of the Office of Utilities Regulations, Anzard Hewitt, defended the decision to grant a 7% bill increase to the Jamaica Public Service Company (JPS) post-Hurricane Melissa. Hewitt explained that the storm resulted in an estimated 30% reduction in electricity sales, contributing significantly to the increase in fuel and independent power producer rates. He stated, "We have agreed that, look, despite the fact that you are entitled to this pass-through, we have to manage it because your customers are to be protected against rate shocks." Hewitt also revealed that the rate increase could have been much higher, around 45%, but the OUR worked with JPS to phase the charges over six months to minimize the impact on customers.

**Interview 2: Mayor of Kingston and Chairman of the Kingston and St Andrew Municipal Corporation, Andrew Swaby**

Mayor Andrew Swaby pushed back against the government's plan to centralize roads and events management, calling for nationwide consultation with municipal authorities before any move is made. Swaby argued that the shift to a single central authority would remove two core functions from the municipal corporation, which has the capacity and partnership to carry out these functions responsibly and efficiently.

**Interview 3: Tourism Minister Edmund Bartlett**

Tourism Minister Edmund Bartlett addressed concerns about the suspended reopening of Hyatt Hotels and the extended closure of Bahia Principal Hotels and Resorts, stating that these incidents do not signal deeper issues within Jamaica's tourism investment climate. Bartlett emphasized that despite the damage to the country's tourism infrastructure, the overall product remains ripe for investment, and the resilience of the product has fortified the country's position in the global market.

**Interview 4: President of the Student Council at the College of Agriculture, Science and Education, Cameron James**

In an interview with Radio Jamaica, President of the Student Council Cameron James discussed the recent demonstration by students after a student was allegedly sexually assaulted on campus. James expressed frustration with the consistent security concerns and called for improved security measures, including a security committee, proper lighting, and regular debushing. The student council has proposed several measures to enhance security, and the college administration has agreed to implement some of these measures, including contracting a security firm and providing shuttle services between campuses.

**Interview 5: Dr. Lincoln Ferguson**

In a rebroadcast interview, Dr. Lincoln Ferguson shared his inspiring story of overcoming adversity to achieve his goals. Ferguson's father passed away when he was six, and his family struggled financially. Despite the challenges, Ferguson excelled academically, thanks in part to the support of his principal and guidance counselor. He recalled the moment when his principal bought him a set of common entrance books, saying, "It was the most amazing thing in my life at that time... Just the smell of the books was one thing." Ferguson's determination and love for learning ultimately led him to pursue a career in medicine, and he is now a successful doctor.
