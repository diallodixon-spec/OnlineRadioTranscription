20260101 103223 Oh, I want to dance the night away One jam's in a lifetime, baby So don't feel away You don't like the fast life They look on the bright side I go take the blame I just want you come and bite it up Just a little winding up Come and meet me behind the truck and we rev it up Whole day Keep throwing it back at the way you stop Baby, no way We could post up all the pictures you want When you're ready I go over here, darling You go over there But we could meet in the middle and start a bacchanal Play in the middle, hey What we gonna do now Jam to a rhythm in the heat. I can't eval, but in the heat, hey. What we go do now? Start a wine on it. I say compromise on it. Baby, spend time on it. Hey, I say compromise for me. Hey, can we change the world?
