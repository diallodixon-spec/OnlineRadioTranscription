20251225 104428 Oh, you know, sir, customs. Lisa, stop going like you're not having a sense, man. You're not saying everybody will talk about it in the media. You know, I'm not going to stop listening to you, sir. You ever experience that? Customs don't go into your package, suitcase, barrel, or cargo unless you were to ship the item or the agent stand up right there when they inspect it. Listen, customs' job is to protect the borders, collect revenue and to facilitate trade. Them not collect or store shipment, them inspect it and somebody off-represent it for inspection. Eh, so how customs ever get so much cussing then? Tracy, and the customs alone involved in the clearance process you know, even though it's them we tend to talk about. Look at it this way, shipment delayed, talk to your airline agent, missing items, talk to your freight forwarder, the charges surprise you know, call customs, but remember to collect your signed and stamped decoration
