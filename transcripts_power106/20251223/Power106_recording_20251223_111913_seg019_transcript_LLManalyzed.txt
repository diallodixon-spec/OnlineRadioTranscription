20251223 111913 Biles believes collaborative effort between Jamaica and overseas workers, especially on construction works, will enhance the country's rebuilding efforts. Yeah. Governor did himself a whole lot of good yesterday, made a presentation that was very clear, whole lot of clarity, laid out all the problems that the economy faces. He wasn't hiding anything. Yeah. And he's correct in saying that we alone won't be able to do these things so the people believe that them alone can do these things they are making a very big mistake yeah governor spoke with a whole lot of clarity yesterday some 17.1 billion dollars will be offered to private institutional investors and individuals on a competitive basis while 900 million will be offered to public sector institutions on a non-competitive basis. Again, the governor is in a defensive mode. What he's saying, I haven't seen anything from these people in relation to how they are going to grow the economy and generate more foreign exchange.
