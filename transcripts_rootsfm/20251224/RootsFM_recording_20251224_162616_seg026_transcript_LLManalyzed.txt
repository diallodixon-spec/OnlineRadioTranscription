20251224 162616 I feel like running wild As anxious as a little child To bring you near the mistletoe Kiss you once and then some more I wish you a Merry Christmas, baby Such happiness in the coming year Take the halls and holly Sing it holly night Fill the tree with angel hair And pretty, pretty lights. Gotta sleep and wake up just before daylight. All these things and more, all these things and more now, baby. That's what Christmas means to me, my love.
