Mr Taylor, I just walked through Spanish Town and saw something extremely troubling. Uncollected garbage is everywhere, spilling over full garbage bins. Added to this is the debris collected from the drains, which has been left at the side of the road, no doubt awaiting another shower of rain to wash it back into the drains. Even business places are now piling up garbage in front of their business places. Where are the government representatives? Apparently none of our politicians live in the Spanish Town area. asking me to hear this concern as well, so let me see, let me see who I go under. But no, I mean, that doesn't make any sense though, who I really go under sir, choo choo, because I've been hearing about it.
