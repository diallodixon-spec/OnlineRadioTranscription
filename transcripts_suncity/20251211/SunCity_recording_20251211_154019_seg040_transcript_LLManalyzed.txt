Well, it's Christmas time now still, so I understand, you know. Hey man, because I said Davin, glad to see you checked in. And Lesan over there in Miami also checking in and she said, say hello to Queen Jojo for me. Okay, no problem. She's hearing. Jojo, Lesan says hello. She'll be here at five p.m. So you can always send her a message at that time and also during the youth forum which will be at 6pm she's the one hosting the program so you can definitely chime in and give your input and communicate with Queen Jojo and also the panelists, the guests that we'll be having in the in the studio as well all right shoutouts to Trum checking in she says locked in and singing all right Trum let me just become one plus one more person big up to Debbie over there in Mercury Garden
