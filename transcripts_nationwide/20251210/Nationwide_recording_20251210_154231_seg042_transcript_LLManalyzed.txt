============================================================

Just say you're ready When all the baggage just ain't as heavy And the party's over, just don't forget me We'll change the pace and we'll just go slow Won't ever have to worry You track I counted all the days Till you would come back I stood and passed back Now you're missing what we used to have Gives the bright, the bright, the feeling back I was caught up in the aftermath But now, if you really wanna know Thank you for many nights I've been thinking of you
