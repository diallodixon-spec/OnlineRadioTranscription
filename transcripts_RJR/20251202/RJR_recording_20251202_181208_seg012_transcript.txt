Thank you so much for staying with us. We continue with you on Beyond the Headlines. I'm Dionne Jaxmillo.

Mariah in Portmore on our WhatsApp line, 8762540693, 876254 0693, give us your first name, give us your general location.

Well, yes, she did, and you heard them call her on it, but I think they decided to take it as, well, seem to be taking it as a joke, so they didn't make a thing of it. Okay. Tafari in Portmore says, as entertaining as today's parliament has been, it's unfortunate when these things occur,
