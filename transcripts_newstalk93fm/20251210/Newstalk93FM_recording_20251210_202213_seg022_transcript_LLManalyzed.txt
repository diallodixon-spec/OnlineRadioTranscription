I won my race with a run to make you not always die Oh, no, no pressure Make you give me that love If you give me me, I'm not gonna let go Give me, make a girl my zanko Feelings got me hitting on the freaky dance floor Make you give me the love All right. Make you feel my love, oh Make you no disappoint, oh Me, I got you from my end, oh My mind, oh God, I rap in regard Get the way your body make me feel excited Loving you, they put me on the tip of my set Girl, not only you, they make me stick to one girl God, I eat you, I get God
