That's two wingers, a striker, probably Mateus Cunha of Man United and Vinny Jr. as well. Now, in order to get that to work, those front players have to work back. They have to sacrifice. And maybe it's a point that Ancelotti keeps stressing he says that he is not interested in anyone going to the World Cup who wants to be voted the best player in the world he's interested in people who want to be part of a winning team and that's because if this system is going to work with four front players those front players are going going to have to sacrifice.
