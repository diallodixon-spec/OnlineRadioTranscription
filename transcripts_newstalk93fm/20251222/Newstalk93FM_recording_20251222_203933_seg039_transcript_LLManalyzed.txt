20251222 203933 I'm falling, falling, I'm falling. As I lay my bed with my head to the ceiling Say I'm drowning alone and I'm lost in my feelings Somebody send me a sign cause you know that I need it Can't even come back to me cause you know you're my healing. I said it's OK, it's my therapy. Therapy, my therapy. It took away all of my anxiety. Anxiety might rob my day. I tell you that we're all in love.
