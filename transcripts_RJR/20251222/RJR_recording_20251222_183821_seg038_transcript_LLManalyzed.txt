20251222 183821 and I said, listen, I have to go because I haven't heard anything from my sister. So I went down there, traversed through Montego Bay side. By then the road in Longhill leading into Westmoreland was reopened. And so it took me eight hours from Kingston to get to Ferris in Westmoreland. I had to stay the night in a community outside of Subway. I have a relative, my nephew lives there. And in the early morning on Saturday, Sunday rather, I decided to start my journey up to where my sister lives in Westmoreland, a small community named Petersville, just outside of White House in the hills. When I got out at 5 a.m. on the day, I got clearer. You could see the destruction. There was nowhere to walk to her house. All the trees are down, All the houses in the community, they were down. Everything down. I had to walk through some bushes, climb over fallen trees to get to her house carrying stuff. I made about four trips to my vehicle.
