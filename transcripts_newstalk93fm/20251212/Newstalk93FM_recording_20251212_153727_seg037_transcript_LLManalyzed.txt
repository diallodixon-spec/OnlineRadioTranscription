20251212 153727 Hold on, hold on Leave me on red, babe, but I still get the message Instead of lines, three dots, can connect them. And if it ain't right, babe, you know I respect it. But if you need time, just take your time. Honey, I get it, I get, I get it. The way you got me on in my head. I think I'd rather you in my bed. Whatever it is, you know I can take it. Counting the days, how many days till I can see you again. Blowing kisses like we could chill my night. I'm cute but with arrows babe, I'm just shooting my shot.
