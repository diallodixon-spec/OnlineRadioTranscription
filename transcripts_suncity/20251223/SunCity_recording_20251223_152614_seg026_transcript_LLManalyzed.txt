20251223 152614 You're welcome to vacate on my island class Ultimately, we are one little signal Let me see you light it up We are diamonds in the rough Voices so loud, can't be denied Across the world, our lives still shine together We We are one people, oh. One people. One country, oh. One country. Spreading love everywhere we go. Hey, one people. One people, one country, oh. Spreading love, everywhere we go. Everywhere. All right. Come to Jamaica, the land of duty, where life on the beach feels like coming. We take a trip, touch down if you're feeling groovy. We party every year, cause we love to party. We will rise above the hardness of the times. Even though sometimes the hills are hard to climb, let your light shine.
