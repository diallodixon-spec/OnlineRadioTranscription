20251215 205527 I'm trying to find something to do, baby, until your return. Turn on the TV or play some solitaire. It does the job for a while. But nothing takes the place of you. There's no substitute. There ain't no substitute. Cause you're all that I want in me. Only you can set me free. Don't stay too long. Don't stay long. Pretty baby. Know you're what you are. Don't stay away from me. Pretty baby. Oh, what a night! Oh, what a joy!
