This Christmas, Scotiabank wants to make your holiday plans a little easier with the Scotiabank Plan Loan. Yes, it's me, Santa, and even I needed a little extra help last year. My Scotiabank plan loan helped me fix up the workshop, treat Mrs. Claus to a holiday getaway, and cover a few health related expenses.
