============================================================

Take the name of Jesus with you Child of sorrow and of woe Don't you know, don't you know He will joy and comfort give you Child of sorrow and the flow Don't you know He can free you from your burden And cleanse you of your sin Just Just open your heart, let joy and peace within. He's the lily of the valley. He's the bright and morning star.
