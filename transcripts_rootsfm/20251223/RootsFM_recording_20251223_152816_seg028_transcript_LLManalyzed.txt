20251223 152816 You're listening to Roots 96.1 FM. You are now live in the mix. It's DJ String, the prince of afternoon radio. For so long, your heart's been aching But you're too shy to say it inside We both know what's been going on We know the game and we're gonna play it I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling Gotta make you understand Never gonna give you up Never gonna let you down Never gonna run around and desert you Never gonna make you cry Never gonna say goodbye Never gonna tell goodbye And hurt you, never gonna give you up
