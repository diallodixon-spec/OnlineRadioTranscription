Under the agreement, AIC is required to make payments totaling just over 94 million US dollars by December 31, comprising approximately 19 million US dollars in outstanding interest and US$75 million toward principal. However, the trustee says it has not yet received the required payments and has been advised by the issuer that it intends to make the payments on or before January 26 next year. JCSD trustee services has warned that if the payments are not made, it is committed to pursuing the instructions outlined in bondholders' resolution. The advisory comes as Michael Lee Chin confirmed that he has begun a structured, time-bound review of repayment options under an agreement reached with bondholders.
