20251224 100703 We lie back A beautiful, beautiful time lapse Ferris wheels, kisses and lilacs And things I said were dumb Cause I thought that I'd never find that Beautiful, beautiful life that Shimmers that innocent light back Like when we were young Every youngest child felt they were raised up in the wild but now you're home If this isn't savage And I'm never gonna let you down I'm never gonna leave you I've had so many traitors Smooth operators But I'm never gonna break that vow I'm never going to leave you
