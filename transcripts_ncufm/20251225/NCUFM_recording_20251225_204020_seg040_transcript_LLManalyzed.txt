20251225 204020 are so intolerant. People were offended. Don't you think God is offended when you change His word? God is tolerant. He'll understand. I don't think so. He wasn't very tolerant of Sodom and Gomorrah or of the world when He sent the flood. Oh, we've eliminated those events from our Bible. Listen, God wants what's best for us. Ignoring His moral standards doesn't change His expectations of us, regardless of how offensive you find them. Oh, sorry if I've offended you. Don't worry about me. It's God you need to be concerned about. Another message from Lifeline Productions, located on the web at lifelinepro.com.
