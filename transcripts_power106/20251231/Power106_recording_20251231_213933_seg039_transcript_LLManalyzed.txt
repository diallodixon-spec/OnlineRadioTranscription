20251231 213933 I'm happy with the package Let's forget this talk about marriage I just give me to myself I don't claim to be an angel But the devil is no friend of mine I've given you a chance to love me But you wanna waste my time If you want to meet, you've got to take me as I am, because I've accepted you for what you are. And if you mean to me, you've gotta try to understand. You shouldn't try to change me, love me as I am I don't claim to be an angel
