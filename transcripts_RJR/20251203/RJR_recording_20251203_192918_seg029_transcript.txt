============================================================

I appreciate your work Dion and all angles and I think that's where we have to end here on Beyond the headlines today but you can come back to us tomorrow at 5 o'clock for news and 5.20 for discussion on behalf of the team or intern Jadim Hall as well as production assistant Yannick Williams and of course, studio engineer Judith McGregor. Once again, I am Kemmon White, sitting in for, well, special thanks, rather, to regular host, Dion Jackson Miller. Once again I'm Kemmon White, have yourselves this oath to serve and protect, to serve and protect you.
