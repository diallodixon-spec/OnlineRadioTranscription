20251231 200708 That's alright I found a martyr in my bed tonight Stops my bones from wonderin' Just who I am, who I am Who I am, oh who am I? Well, some nights I wish that these all would end Cause I could use some friends friends would change And some nights I'm scared you'll forget me again And some nights I always win I always win When I still wake up I still see your ghost Oh lord I'm still not sure What I stand for What do I stand for? Most nights I don't know So this is it I sold my soul for this Wash my hands of that for this
