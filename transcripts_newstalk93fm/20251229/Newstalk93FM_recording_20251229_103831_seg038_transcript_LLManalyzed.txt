20251229 103831 And I try my best to keep my head up Every day I get in the morning I hat it Me cooler ready Me heist done ready Me punching that's automatic I have a lightning jumbie A kind of energy inside me And it ready for the rum, ready ready for the rum Ready ready for the rum ready for the action A spiritual encounter Kid me soul taking over Telling me to start up the drinking Can't do away with good behaviour So we out on the road now BOOM! It's Mars and Riddy Man
