20260101 101107 I found the nerve to try again Some broken hearts given time will mend Will you be gentle if I surrender all to you, to you Please understand that I've got to be sure The lessons I've learned, I can't ignore Will you be gentle more Will you be gentle If I surrender all to you? Take good care of me
