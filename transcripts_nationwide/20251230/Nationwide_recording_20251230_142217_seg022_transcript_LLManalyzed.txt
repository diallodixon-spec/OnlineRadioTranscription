20251230 142217 There's one thing I can't stand is me hearing you so early in the morning This 9 to 5 I have is surely getting to me For the third time this week I think I'm gonna have to call in sick If I leave you now I'll be losing my mind I hope we never get tired And I never have to go to work No one knocking on the door Disrespecting the noticed girl Sorry, no, baby, crying And no horn blowing Just the whisper of our voices A man who don't sweet treat his woman He's surely wasting a lot of time She might not say it but she needs tenderness for your life When I look in your eyes
