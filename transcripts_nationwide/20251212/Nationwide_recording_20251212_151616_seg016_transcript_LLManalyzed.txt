Do it all again Where's Friday night Do it all again You think I'm pretty Without any makeup on You think I'm funny When I touch the crunch line wrong I know you get me so I let my walls come down, down Before you met me, I wasn't right, but things were kinda heavy You brought me to life now, every February You'll take my valentine,, Valentine Let's go all the way tonight No regrets, just love We can dance until we die You and I, we'll be young forever
