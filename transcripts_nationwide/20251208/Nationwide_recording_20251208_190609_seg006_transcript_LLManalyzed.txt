New York City's mayor-elect, Zoran Momdani, is advising immigrants that they have the legal right not to speak to or comply with ICE agents amid sweeps across the Big Apple. Momdani said that as mayor, he would protect the rights of the roughly 3 million migrants in New York City. He did so in a video on the social media platform X. The incoming Mayor said that ICE officers cannot enter an individual's home, school, or private workplace without a judicial warrant signed by a judge. He also says individuals have the right to remain silent, ask whether they are free to go while being detained and film ICE activities.
