20251212 190002 Zulu Warrior is currently showing as the 7-2 second choice in the Overnight Odds, which have the Dane Nelson Mount Atlantic Convoy as the 5-2 favourite. There's also good support for Major Danger at 4-1 with Linton Steadman, Teflon Don the Mount of Robert Halladine, and Shooting Star to be ridden by Paul Country Francis. The 4-year-old chestnut colt Zula Warrior from the stables of in-form trainer Adrian Prince has been very consistent in the overnight allowance category failing only to make the frame once since coming to this level on September 7. His last race two weeks ago saw him chasing home a California crown going five and a half furlongs. Prior to that he won going six furlongs after rallying to beat the likes of Oil Machine and Provident and another capital effort is expected this time around. The presence of four-time champion Jockey Day Nelson on Atlantic Convoy should ensure a decent effort from the five-year-old Chestnut Horse on whom he won a year ago. Zulu Warriors stablemate a shooting star who is seeking a hat-trick of wins moves up in class for this contest
