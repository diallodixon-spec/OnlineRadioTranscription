20260102 113528 So many men that I dream of my love, so many men that I work for my love. So many men they I kill for my love. Hey, yo. So many men get that shirt for my love. But let me tell you, I ain't really got the time. Look what I gave for you, I'm too much of a dime. You really want to get with this one of a kind? You got to give me everything like all your pride. My love, love. Baby girl. You just give me everything like I am right. My love, love, can't just give you my love. Love, so sweet, sweet for real. Love, love can't just give me.
