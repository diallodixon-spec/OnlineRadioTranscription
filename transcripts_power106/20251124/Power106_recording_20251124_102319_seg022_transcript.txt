The report stressed that based on the World Bank's estimate that Hurricane Melissa wiped out 41% of GDP and the debt-to-GDP ratio is now at 115%. As one of the principal architects of the Peshekarib deal and the highest-ranking foundation member of the epoch, we know a lot more about the Jamaican economy and its debt-to- GDP ratio than the Hapness minister who opposed the deal and the World Bank representative. So we know that Jamaica's GDP was at $3.2 trillion last year. We also know that 41% of that is $1.3 trillion. And we also know that the debt is $2.2 trillion, although the hapless finance minister and the government is trying to give the impression that we have been paying down the debt, which was at $2 trillion in 2016. So if the GDP is now at $1.9 trillion and the debt is $2.2 trillion, the debt-to-GDP ratio is now 115%. So we do not need the World Bank to tell us that. And it cannot be based on this year's GDP of $3.5 trillion.
