2025-12-12 15:57:24 Under its new global health aid strategy, the US prioritizes direct deals with governments rather than channeling funding through aid agencies. Countries are required to increase their own health spending. The US contributes $1.7 billion and the Kenyan government covers $850 million and gradually takes on more responsibility. The US has since entered into similar deals with Rwanda, Liberia and Uganda. But many Kenyans have raised concerns that the deal could allow the US to view personal medical records such as their HIV status, TB treatment history and vaccination data. The High Court agreed to bar the implementation of the deal until the full case is heard. Kenya's government has sought to reassure citizens over the deal. The U.S. has not commented about the data privacy concerns. The case is due in court on February 12. And that's it for the Education and Health Report.
