Don't seem so far away I will never find another lover sweeter than you, sweeter than you And I will never find a lover more precious than you, more precious than you The girl you want Close to me you're like my mother Close to me, you're like my father Close to me, You're like my sister Close to me You're like my brother You are the only one You're my everything And for you the song I sing You all my life I pray for someone like you And I thank God that I finally found you In all my life I prayed for someone like you
