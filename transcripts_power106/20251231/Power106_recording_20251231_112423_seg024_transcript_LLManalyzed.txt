And hear my thing now. As we said, too many people have been silent. The churches have been very silent in what is happening in the country. So I do not believe that the churches should be taking any money from the government. Because we need the voice of the churches now to deal with some of the problems that we are having in the country. Too many people are silent. Academia silent. Umbrella groups silent. Church silent. No. If I were one of the church leaders, I wouldn't be taking money from the government because we need the church to start criticizing the government and some of the things that it is doing. You think their independence would be compromised? Compromised, that's the point I'm making. I think it's rare.
