20251218 161113 I have never had to ride in a one-horse open sleigh Or watch Santa Claus and his reindeer fly away Where was Khan our bread, fruit, our turkey for Christmas dinner Down in Jamaica there's hot sunny weather And people are warm and friendly all the time Now it's the Christmas season and it's warm here down So have a joyful, iry Christmas in the sun Junko and Nick don't mean a thing to me I know about sorrow and junko loop and chatting together oh yeah
