20251225 150704 We are team to celebrate I'm telling you Hard work without the work, it's not worth it We don't want no batter that I need a liquor breeder Two days on the road with some jam in the middle Drive me home, we need to find the middle For the sake of peace of mind So the middle of the road is clear You'll find me and my friend and them because We move so hard, so hard For a week, we deserve a party She deserved it, she deserved it, she said We deserve it, she said we deserve it Tell your friend and them we deserve it
