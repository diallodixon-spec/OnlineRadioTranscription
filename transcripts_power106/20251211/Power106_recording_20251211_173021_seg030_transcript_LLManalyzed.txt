2025-12-11 18:49:47 where Germany in particular is competitive. But isn't it true that they're less competitive in general across all industries right now? And whether that's a combustion engine or an electric motor, just given the cost of labor, the cost of everything. In other words, this won't suddenly make the German car companies more competitive again, will it? Yeah, you're absolutely right. Germany is suffering a lot of fundamental issues over regulations, high labor costs, very high social standards. And I think that needs to be done in parallel, not only save the auto industry, but really reinvent Germany from scratch, basically. Chancellor Mertz tries to go that path, but he's in a coalition with social democrats, so he has to find compromises. That will be a tough ride to reinvent Germany, but your general observation is definitely right.
