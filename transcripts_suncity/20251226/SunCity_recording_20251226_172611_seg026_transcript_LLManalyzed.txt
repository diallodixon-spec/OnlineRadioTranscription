20251226 172611 Alright folks, welcome back to Live Racing. We're here for the 11th and final race from Caymano Spark and what it's's gonna be. Field of 12 very young horses, two year olds. This is the way in the Costa Stakes. And again, very competitive field of 12 runners. A lot of them are going their journey, if not all of them for the first time. Eight furlongs is the journey. A number of them just starting their racing career so they haven't... It's kind of a guessing game as to see who will relish this journey so early in their careers. But you know what? It's named after Wayne da Costa who won so many different championships.
