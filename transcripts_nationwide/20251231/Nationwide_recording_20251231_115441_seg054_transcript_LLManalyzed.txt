20251231 115441 I think we had a pretty good year. I think in terms of the economy, it could have been better. I see where books are getting new jobs. The economy is not as great as it used to be but i think people are coping people are people are still living uh people are still still making making due with what they have um and for the most part look we still get to do the things that we enjoy um and my friends we get to travel we to go places, we get to do do the things that we enjoy doing. So, from that perspective, I think for the folks that I am associated with, I think we're, I think we we did relatively okay. Very well. Who you want to shout out to in Jamaica before we go?
