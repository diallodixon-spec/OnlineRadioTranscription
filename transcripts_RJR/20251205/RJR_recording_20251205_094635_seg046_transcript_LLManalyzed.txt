on Hotline. Radio Jamaica, active for the good of our nation. Thank you, listeners. We're back with you on the Hotline. We will be taking your calls. We were scheduled to have a consultant this morning talking about matters of relevance to you and all of the emerging, the new avenues in which people are rebuilding. But perhaps we'll fix that for next me in studio today. Hello, this is Conversations with the NHT. Good morning. Hi, morning. Morning. Who is this? This is G for Post West.
