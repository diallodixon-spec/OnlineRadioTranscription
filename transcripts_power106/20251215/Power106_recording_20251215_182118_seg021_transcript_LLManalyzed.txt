So that's also very significant. She just went out there and right off the bat she smashed three in. So that's her great form continuing. And again, remember that she had a bad injury ending the the last season I think or earlier this season so that would have taken her out of international competition somewhat because the club was trying to protect her I think and in the Guardian it had said she had taken a year off but they didn't say for what reasons but now that she's back I think you should see her climb in the ladderala backup again. I mean, as a Ballon d'Or, highly ranked Ballon D'Or candidate, she's naturally going to go right back up in the rankings. Let's focus a little bit on her strike rate. She had the highest at the international level, believe it or not.
