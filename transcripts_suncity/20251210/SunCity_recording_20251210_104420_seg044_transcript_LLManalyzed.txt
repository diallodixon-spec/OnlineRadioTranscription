You said I shouldn't hate your grudge And I won't, not even for a minute Let only truth come from my lips Bless our souls, cause without you we can't make it God works over our shoulders tonight And help us live our words tomorrow Let's not forget where we're from For the show is the way to go You are the wind beneath my wings See me through all the things You lifted me when I was down Now you have me standing on higher ground Lord watch over shoulders tonight And help us lead by words tomorrow Let's not forget where we're from Father show us the way to go How excellent is that name Deliver us from sin and shame Out of the mountain babe And suckle in you of our day's strength
