20251216 111512 of next year. It will be coupled with a PDC event, which is a qualifier for Latin America and the Caribbean. Our players will be trying to qualify for this very event that's taking place now. This will be one of the qualifiers. There are three. Last year, one of our rising players, Jonathan Heron, he's actually ranked fifth in Latin America and the Carribean. Oh, that's not bad. And he only attended two of the three. So I imagine if he had attended all three, his ranking would be higher. Right. It took us as far as Chile in October for the final of those opportunities. OK. So it's July for the Caribbean Championship. And then there are the PDC qualifiers spread between April and October. And we'll be making every effort to support the players who want to participate so they can interact with players above their skill level, punch above their weight, and in so doing, get the confidence that they need to rise. Thank you very much, Evan.
