20251222 151613 Take the blade I just want you come and rise it up Just a little whine there now Come and meet me at the end of the truck and we rev it up Step all day Keep throwing it back at the way you stopped us Baby no way We could boast of all the pictures you want When you're ready I could overshare Darling, you could overdo it What we could eat in the middle and start a bacchanal. Play in the middle, hey. What we gonna do now? Jam to a rhythm, yeah. Eat a carnival, baby. Hey, what we go do now? Start a wine on it. I say compromise on it. Baby, spend time on it. I say compromise on it.
