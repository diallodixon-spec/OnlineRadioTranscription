Baby, washing my hips and waist So feminine with grace I touch your soul when you hear me say, boy Let me be a woman Let me be your woman Women, women, women I can be your woman Woman, woman, woman I can be your lady I'm a woman,'m a mother fucker but they got a problem Put some babies in your life and take away the drama Put the paper in the picture like a diorama Gotta face a lot of people of the opposite Cause the world told me we ain't got the common sense Gotta prove it to myself that I'm on top of shit And you would never know a guy without a goddess is honest And I'm just kidding I could be on everything I mean I could be the leader head of all the states I could smile and jiggle and tell us pockets empty I could be the CEO just like a Robin Fenty And I'mma be there for you cause you on my team girl Don't ever think you ain't had these dreams girl They wanna pit us against each other when we succeed And for no reason they wanna see us end
