20251217 204929 I don't want to be naive, don't want to regret Because the life won't let me down, it was like D-word Before I let you in, I got to get to know you first My love, love conscious, I want you to trust it, girl The stars and the moon shine bright, ready to sign the dotted line. I know you're anxious, you want me to touch it, girl. But welcome, trust me, I want you to trust it, girl. The stars and the moonshine for us, girl. You are my Isis and you're my Cyrus, girl. My love, love. Baby, girl. You just gave me my love. My love.
