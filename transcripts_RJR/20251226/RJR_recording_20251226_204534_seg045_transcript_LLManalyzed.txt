20251226 204534 But I'm a Jamaican boy who was born and raised Nowadays I'm lost between two shores L.A.'s fine but it ain't home New York's home but it ain't mine no more I am myself Didn no one dare And no one heard at all Not even the chance I am my pride Not gonna feel like a woman's touch As the morning sun comes shining on my face, yeah, believe you're not here in my place. I miss you.
