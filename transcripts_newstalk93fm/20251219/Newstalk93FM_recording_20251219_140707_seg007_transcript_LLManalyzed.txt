When you're feeling under the weather You just make me feel sweet Ice the cocoa tea, use the sugar And together we are complete, darling Heat me up Only you alone can put fire back in the soul Heat me up I could never let you go. Miss Oshine, Miss Oshine. Girl, I promise no more, I'll see you again. All day through the night, I dreamin'. Miss Oshine Miss Oshine When you turn the top, make it smooth, my darling. When outside is pouring rain, say put a button on the fire.
