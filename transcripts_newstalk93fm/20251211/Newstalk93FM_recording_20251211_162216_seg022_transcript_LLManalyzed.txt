2025-12-12 10:06:07 I see this fine girl from my party, she wear yellow Every other girl did they do too much but this girl mellow Now you might find situation I could use, they tell I'm mellow Finally I find way to talk to the girl but she ain't no one follow Who you gonna phone for more? Why you no one call for more? Then I start to feel a bum bum bum But she didn't give me small small one I know, she said she saw people sit down one't tell no And my hips make you cry when I'm moving around you
