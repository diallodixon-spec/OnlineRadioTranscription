============================================================

You see the tears in my eyes, I said. Chance is such a surprise. Please don't think I'm feeling sad. I'm getting back the love I had. If you believed a long day, but have never known all of the time. Oh I know we're starting over again It's not the easiest thing to do I'm feeling inside again Cause every time I look at you I know we're staring over again
