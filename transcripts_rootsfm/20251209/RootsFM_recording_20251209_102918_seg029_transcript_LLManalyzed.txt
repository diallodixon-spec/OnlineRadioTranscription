============================================================

The appointment comes with a lesson It's for me to get wiser, got to work harder In the end, it will get better Lord, I thank you for sunshine, thank you for rain Thank you for joy, thank you for pain It's a beautiful day, it's a beautiful day. If you got life, then you've got friends. You may not have money, but you're living day by day. You can't have faith and don't want to work. Get up off that seat and put that brain to work.
