Pay something, man. Pay something. You know, sir, I'm not the first, I hear this person ask this question, if Mr. Decker's son is a member of the Babsai team, Donovan Decker's? You know, yeah, the second time I think somebody's asking this, you know. I think it's the same person asking again. Donovan, never mind asking. I don't think so. You may ask Donovan right now. Johnny, ask him. That means that Donovan, where did you you get that? Let me get that because I wonder if it's Donovan come on the radio, come say so. Because if I see him, something I may talk about it. I got jackass for a cane bump, got a pound. Because if not, not go so. Yes. Good afternoon. Donovan, is your son one of the, um, bobsledders that have won gold for Jamaica? Someone wants to know on the show. Donovan, please respond promptly. Thank you. Okay. You look like in company.
