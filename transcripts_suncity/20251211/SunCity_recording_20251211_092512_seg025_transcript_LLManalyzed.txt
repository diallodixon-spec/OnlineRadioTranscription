you think is too good to be true, then it is. It's a lie. And when people, I don't even know, but them poor old people, they fall for it. Yes, you've won out a million. You just have to send. You didn't enter anything. So why did you win something? And then why do you have to send money to get it? Exactly. I don't know one company or one lottery or one anything that you have to pay to get your winnings. I've never heard of that. Worse if you've never entered anything. And that's what upsets me sometimes. Cause I'm like, you're greedy. Why are you, you haven't won anything. You haven't entered anything. Why are you sending your hard earned money? But the thing is what upsets me is that these people, like you, I don't know how people have the heart, the conscious, the soul to like do this to old people that's just their whole life savings just gone in seconds. It's, it's, oh boy, people lost their house. They've lost their livelihood.
