I'm full, full of visions, unrealized, full of dreams, unrealized with no strategy given, full of songs, full of businesses that could have changed the world. But I held on to it because I got comfortable and I got complacent. But when I get to heaven, I want to hear himself, well done, good and faithful servant.
