Just it's very difficult to hear you, but let's see how best I can. OK, so let's ask the students to make some adjustments here. So they'll work on that. Yes. All right. So the National Drink Ride campaign, give us all the background about that, because I know that Red Stripe has been doing this for a number of years now. Yes, yes, yes. So it's actually transitioned from Drink Right. So this is a campaign that we started way back in 2008. And it was Think Responsibly, Drink Responsibly. It transitioned to Drink right, right age, right amount, right way and now it is drink and live responsibly. So it expanded the campaign in a big way to make sure it's not just about drinking but also how you look wholesome
