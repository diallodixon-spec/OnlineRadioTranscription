20251231 193016 All right Sunnys, that's it for me. Yeah, this is the last time you'll be hearing my voice in 2025. But of course you'll be here in my voice tomorrow. Yeah man, I'll be back for Lovers Thursday, 3 p.m. to 7.30 p.m. nonstop love songs. But continue to keep it locked, Sonja Yumi is in the building. Sunnys, I just wanna to thank you all for the support in 2025. Trust me, you've made my job so easy, so fun. And I really, really appreciate every single listener out there. Whether you are active on the WhatsApp line or not, big up on yourself. I really, really, really, appreciate every single one of you guys out there. Shout outs to TJ. TJ said lovely show as usual. Yeah man, thanks TJ. Happy New Year to you and the family when it comes, safe travel. Bless, appreciate that TJ. Same to you, same to you. Johnny Mega over there in Chicago.
