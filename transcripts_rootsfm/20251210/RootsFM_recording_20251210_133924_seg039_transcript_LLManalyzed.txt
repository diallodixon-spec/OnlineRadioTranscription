I still believe that you can, darling. I still believe, that you love me, baby. Forever and ever. She would take her time, and she would walk on by. And still I I would ignore to even drop a line no I would give the world to have you back on spine I took her for credit and lost it all But I know these dogs, she loves me, and she cares.
