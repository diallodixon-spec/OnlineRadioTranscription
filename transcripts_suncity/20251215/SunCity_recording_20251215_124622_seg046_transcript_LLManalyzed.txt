20251215 124622 Say goodbye I'm holding you tight. At least I'm not trying to just break down and cry. Pain in my head. Oh, I'd rather be dead. Spending the road in a row. Although we've come to the end of the road, still I can't let you go. It's unnatural. You've been wrong to me. I've been wrong to you. Go to the end of the road.
