20251217 181810 Sizzla's part. So let me play back this from top. This is Rock Stone by Steve Marley and Capetown and the Sizzla. Conduct a ball, be big of yourself. East side crew checking in. Shout out to Natalie, got it locked I guess in our life, our innards are to make them pay off. Self-implied, cannot get laid off. But the work we have, can even get a day off. Who do you want to slap me down the pine? I'll set them way off. All right.
