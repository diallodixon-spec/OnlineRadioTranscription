20251218 165426 Just tell me on the hill they can tell you they know what's in my heart. What do they get from telling you that I don't give a damn about you? Just tell me why the hell somebody wants to tear you apart. Why do the people have to tell you lies? I know, I know. I love you more than words could ever show. I can't explain. Why do some people have to be better? I can't take much more. I can't ignore. I have to let you know what's in my heart. I'll never ever say that I love you.
