============================================================

You weren't born blind as well, correct? Technically it was. It happened post-birth. I was born premature. And what had happened was, I guess the doctors had already pronounced me dead while in the womb. They had pronounced me stillborn. And when I came out, they were about to ship me off to the morgue, but then I cried out. And then they had incubated me for about three months, because I was born about five months and two weeks. They had incubated for about three months. But my eyes, they never received whatever covering that was supposed to be administered. And as a result, the light in the incubator burnt out all the oxygen in my retinas. So over time, I gradually started to lose the sight, but it was at a very, very young age. So me, I've never known vision. Got you. I have to say though, that I can't just skim over what you just said, because I know it's something you've lived with, so you used to. I can imagine my listeners just hearing that.
