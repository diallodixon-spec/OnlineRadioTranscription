of the student loan bureau, Nikesha Walsh. Now to the agriculture sector. Minister of Agriculture Floyd Green has announced that phase one of the National Agricultural Recovery Program has been completed. This included the use of intensifying our interventions over the next six months.

We're already in an additional stage of procurement for another $70 million worth of seed.
