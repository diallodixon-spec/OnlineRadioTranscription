20251218 105740 You better be good, I'm telling you why Santa Claus is coming to town Sleigh bells ring, all you're listening In the lane, snow is glistening A beautiful sight, we're happy tonight Walking in a winter wonderland Gone away is the new bird Here to stay is the new bird He's singing his song as he go along, walking in a winter wonderland. In the meadow, he can build a snowman and pretend that he is Pops or Brown. He'll say, are you married? We'll say, no, man. You can do the job when you're in town. Later on, we'll conspire. Have me dream by the fire. We'll face on and pray the dreams that we made walking in a winter wonderland.
