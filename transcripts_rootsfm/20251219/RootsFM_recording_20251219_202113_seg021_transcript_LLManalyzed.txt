20251219 202113 There's no me without you There's no meaning to life without you Tell me why should I care about doing my hair When I get stuck up thinking about you There's no moon without you. There's no Saturday night without you. And there's no walk through the park, no beating my heart. No, I love you. No, I can't live without you. So blue for you. So deep in love with you So hard to say bye bye When you know how hard I've tried
