It's not how many times you get knocked down. Yeah. Yeah. How many times you get up. You know, as we sit here in the heart of the inner city, Dona Tonas, I like to say, you know, at Spectrum Management, their second annual wellness fair. There's so many people in the community who need that resilience from way before OCAD 5, but what words of wisdom would you give to people who are hearing us who come from that region? What words of wisdom, I like to say, wow, would you, even one word, would you send over to those people who are going through a difficult time? It's temporary. It is not permanent. It's a process. The question now is not what happened then. It's what we do now. What are you prepared to do?
