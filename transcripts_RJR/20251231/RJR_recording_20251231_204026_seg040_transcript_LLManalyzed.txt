20251231 204026 I get close to you You always say not tonight You said you'd be here for me But when you turn away Why don't you treat me right? I don't believe it should be like this Knowing your love I just can't resist I want you babe To be holding me So why don't you give me the love that I need Girl this is your chance to pour it all So don't waste another moment baby With me you have to make romance So pour it all I don't know what else to say I think I said it all It's time for action to start Girl try to understand It's got to be this way If you still want my heart
