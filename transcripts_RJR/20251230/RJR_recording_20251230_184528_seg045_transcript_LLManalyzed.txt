Now, although playing to a one-all draw, both Racing United and Darnit Gardens believe they should have come away with a win in their rear-neve of Jamaica Premier League at the Anthony Spalding Sports Complex on Monday. Fabian Reid pulled the junglist in front in minute 67, but T'Jay Grant Gran pulled the league leaders level in the 74th minute. The result meant Racing moved to 27 points and remained atop the standings while Arnett Gardens remained just above the relegation zone in 11th and 13 points. Anthony Patrick is the coach of Racing.
