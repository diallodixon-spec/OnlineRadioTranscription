20251229 192415 Yes, there's a little bit of South American talent in the Paris Saint-Germain team. There's Marquinhos, the Brazilian centre-back, although he's struggling to be fit in time. And there is Pacho, this big left-footed Ecuadorian centre-back. But they've got a lot of French talent. And France is one of the great producers of talent in world football. Again, so many Afro descendants there. I'm always of the view that Africa won the World Cup for the first time in 1958 when Brazil won it. There's a strong African influence there. And Africa is now helping France win some titles. So there is a lot of talent, a lot of talent. More experience, perhaps, with Flamengo. It's a very battle-hardened team. Can they, at the end of the season this is the end of the the South American season got a tired limbs out there can they hold Paris Saint-Germain for the full 90 I doubt it to be honest but if they can just hold on and seize their moment we could see a win and it's been a long time since South America
