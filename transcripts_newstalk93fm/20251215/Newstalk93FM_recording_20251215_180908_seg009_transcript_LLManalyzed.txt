Hot and groovy Hot and groovy Look what so good for me It's happy and I'm again Feel like a movie When you throw it back on me I feel no stress again Let let me dance in the dark. We shall live, feeling rhythm in Teneco. Take two fall in love, baby. I didn't know we were dead. Looked it back and oh, no, no, no. Welcome to drop down, baby.
