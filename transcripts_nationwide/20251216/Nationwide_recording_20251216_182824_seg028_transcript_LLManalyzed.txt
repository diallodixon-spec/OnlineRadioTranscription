20251216 182824 your reaction this evening to the 7% increase in JPS bills for this month I'll start on our Facebook platform where Clifton is saying we should ask the opposition they were the one who negotiated the contract that's according to Clifton and he says pure genius okay George Elliott is saying there's a reasonable explanation for the increase and the country was advised to expect it resulting from the use of expensive fuel. In any case, it wasn't a high or it wasn't as high as the 16.5%, uh, imposed after barrel. Uh, Kurt Powell saying it's a very tedious situation. We just have to remain positive and hope for the best as things are very challenging currently. Oddly, Nain says the JPSco should be encouraging people who are not on the grid to get regularized and try and collect from those people. The company would collect a lot more money from those people.
