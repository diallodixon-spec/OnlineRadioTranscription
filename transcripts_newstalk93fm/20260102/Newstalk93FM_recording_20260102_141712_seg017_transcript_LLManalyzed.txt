20260102 141712 And I know you said not to call You didn't really miss you And I hope I can see you I hope you're well, I hope you live. I miss your touch, I miss your smell, I miss your lips. Maybe grab a drink, maybe grab some food, don't be shy. Call my mama, baby. I know it's hard, but I don't have the glass. I have to protect my heart. I built the wall so tall, I couldn't look over. I need to touch you. One more time. I need to see you. I'll take you one by one.
