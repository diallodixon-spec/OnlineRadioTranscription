20251223 105323 I wanna be a fly to make you be clean Believe in a god and he'll call me a witch I'm grateful and I'm unshakeable I'm grateful and that's why I'm capable No matter how high you be, you're gonna stumble So I'll forever be humble I'll forever be, I, ever be No, we'll never change, never change Stay by my side, love, we'll juggle from evil The earth and sky, now full of wicked people Love know how to simmer and They don't know what to fight, what to fight All I've got my bad man and my hopelessness What if we could make a change?
