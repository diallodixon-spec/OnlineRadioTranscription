20251230 131813 Last night I had the strangest dream I sailed away to China Seen a litter of bulk to find ya And you said you had to get your laundry clean Didn't want no one to hold you What does that mean? And you said Ain't nothing gonna break my stride Nobody gonna slow me down But oh, I've got to keep on movin' Ain't nothing gonna break my stride I'm runnin' in a one-touch crowd Oh no, I got to keep on movein' You're on the roll and now you play with me
