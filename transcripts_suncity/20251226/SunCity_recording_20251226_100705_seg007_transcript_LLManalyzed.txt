20251226 100705 I swear. No chicken. No curry goat. None of them think they ain't on my plate. Cut the hell tail. In the meantime, right now, I want to send shout out to Joy from Spanish Town. I know she enjoy the energy. Big up yourself, Joy. Send shout out to Leon. Also want to say shout out to CP Chill Spot Taranto. You know, got it locked in. Shout out to all the peeps on the TikTok right now. Big up on yourself, enough love, enough respect. All right, shout out to Mr. Billings. Shout out to Queen Jojo. Hey, crazy in the whole family. Merry Christmas to the whole Sunites. Big up the Sun Jacks, them. All members of Sun City 104.9 FM. We just want to say happy holidays. You know the tingle. Still keep the vibe going. We got 30 more minutes.
