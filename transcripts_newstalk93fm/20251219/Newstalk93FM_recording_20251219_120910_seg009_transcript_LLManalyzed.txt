20251219 120910 I'm the director So I can't even reach high Out on the road, beat it All by the stage, beat it All in the band, beat it We on by the trap, beat it Out on the road Beat it All on the stage Beat it All by the trap Beat it Where we meeting up, beat it Drop your location Tell me where every friend to discuss your behavior. When you reach the road, get on like you're catch-act-able. Advertise the mode, jump off cause it's one from Ali, the fan of the year. Inside, they're pumped up by me, displaying me self, like we don't care about nobody. Out on the gravity, almighty state, all in the gravity, almighty trumpeting.
