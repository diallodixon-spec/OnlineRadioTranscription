20251226 152715 The one who reigns over land and all the sea We bow before you like Noah Cause you're the one who gives me life and liberty And no words can express just how great you are. And no song can not say just how mighty you are. Glory, glory to you, Lord. To heaven and earth and angels sing. We give you the honor and the praise you're the one who knows my name lord we praise you yes we do you are my king forever
