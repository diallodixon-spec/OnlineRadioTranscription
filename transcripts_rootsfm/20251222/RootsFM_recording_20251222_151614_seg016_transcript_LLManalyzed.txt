20251222 151614 I love you, baby, anyway I never buy you fancy clothes I never bought you chocolate or rose I wonder if it's things like those Can make you go away I know your friends been telling you A lot of things about me I don't hear them What am I to do? And I know you've been through lies then I know you've seen many faces Oh I know you think that this is what I have to say You could have never found another one like me
