20251218 130706 Oh Just as long as you're there, as long as there is you. I know I'm not thinking, I'm not thinking about the Christ. I'm sure that they're wonderful, but I won't be there to enjoy the view. I think heaven will be, I think that it will be alright. Just as long as your there there Long as there's you Somebody help us say What am I thinking about? I'm not thinking about the night I'm sure that they're beautiful But I won't be there to join you
