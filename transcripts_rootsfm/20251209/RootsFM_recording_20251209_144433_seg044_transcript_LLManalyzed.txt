============================================================

I feel a shiver running up my spine. It's a lonely, lonely feeling, catching all the time. Every time you go away, it seems I can't live another day. You feel a shiver when I wake. Come back another sleepless night. I feel a shiver, baby. But I'm a true believer. It's you, it's you I'm thinking of right now. I get lonely. That's the dark thing.
