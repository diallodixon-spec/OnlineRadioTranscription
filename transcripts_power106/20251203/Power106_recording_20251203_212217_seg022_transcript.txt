Thank God, I'm free from sin. Listen. Dear Lord, you have answered my prayer. From all strength and misery, you have lifted me up and put me higher. Come on, Saint. End in misery and born again. Happy lives and free from sin. I know the world massive love it and them respect it to man. Hear this? A lot of mercy. Help me pick up Jamaica, the land of wood and water.
