Christmas is coming home The church bells will tell you I'm reading a song With a happier sound Christmas is coming home They're singing that song But it's not like Christmas at all Cause I remember when you were here And all the fun we had last year Pretty lights on the tree I'm watching the time You should be here with me Where's mine? Baby please come home Where's mine?
