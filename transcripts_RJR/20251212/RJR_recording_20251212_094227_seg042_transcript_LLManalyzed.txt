2025-12-12 09:51:43 Alright, Darren Wallace, tell me now what is the role of a building technologist? So, I just want to say thank you. Yes. Mrs. Shields, thank you. Um, Ms. Edwards for, you know, um, letting me be here. Yes. So, the building technologist really, you know, we call ourselves building technologists because we tend to, to bridge the gap between just not only design, right? But we do designs, we do the construction documentation, meaning your bill of quantities, your reports, your project scoping, you know, project scheduling, and we also do construction and project management. All right? So the thing is that what we try to do, or what we have done, is to bring all the professionals under one roof. So when our clients call us, we are able to do the work, do it efficiently, and go to the individuals instead of having the client stressing out themselves trying to find this person, that person.
