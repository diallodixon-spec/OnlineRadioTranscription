20251224 202515 In the west, in the west, every Christmas is a time for all to smile. There's no winter time, there's just sweet sunshine and Christmas Jamaican style. In the West, in the West it rains. Christmas is a time for all to smile. There's no winter time, there's a sweet live. Oh, glory, hallelujah. Oh, glory hallelujah. Oh glory hallelujah. Glory hallelujah to the newborn.
