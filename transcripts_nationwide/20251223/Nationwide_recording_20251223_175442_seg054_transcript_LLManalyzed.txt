I know that the Prime Minister will be making a very fulsome statement on what the DNA of NARA will be. I would say, though, that as a whole of government, while NARA will be responsible for the recovery, NARA will have to depend on other agencies, such as the NWA, such as ADCEM, such as the National Water Commission, Jamaica Public Service Company and so on. What NARA I think will be is a coordinating force that has significant authority to get things done very quickly.
