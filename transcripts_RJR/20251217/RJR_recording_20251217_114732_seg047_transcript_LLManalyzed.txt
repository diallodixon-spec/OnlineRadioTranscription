20251217 114732 a set percentage, that's the question I'm asking. In the agreement, there is obviously a formula that sets the price at which they pass on electricity to the GPS. And again, it is reflective of whatever they're purchasing fuel for, or some indexation to the market, whatever is prevailing atailing at that time and it is of course reflect their capital cost as well. So the requests for JPS for an increase can never be on the basis that the IPPs have sold the, what is it they sell now? The electricity? The electricity. It cannot be that they've sold electricity to a price that is greater than what JPS would produce it for. Can that be a reason for JPS to increase or to seek an increase from you?
