Oh, well. Oh, well. You're the only one for me. Oh, baby. Loving you, girl, can't you see? That we were meant to be. From here to eternity. What did I do to turn you away from me What can I do to have you in my arms. Maybe you were leaving, maybe you were lonely, cause I know that something, something is the matter cause I see the danger in your eyes.
