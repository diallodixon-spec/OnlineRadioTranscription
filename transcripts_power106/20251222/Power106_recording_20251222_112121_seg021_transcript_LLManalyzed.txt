20251222 112121 and then they just crashed and they died it's happened very very very frequently out there I don't know I think there has to be some evaluation of Westmoreland roads I mean I know we have to depend on motorbikes down there because the roads are absolutely horrible and Westmoreland is quite mountainous but some of the accidents down there yeah man you can't explain it in terms of how many of them crashed. Freak accidents, I do. I can't work it out at all. And you know, we have bike taxis, right? Yeah, of course, we know that, man. Lots and lots of bike taxis. Taxi man, they're crashing into each other. Yeah, man. I don't know. Head down. Yep. Ray, please, you may have to come and check out that one for us. Believe it or not, motorbikes crashing head on. That don't make any sense to me. That's exactly why you have a motorbike. Because it don't take up much space.
