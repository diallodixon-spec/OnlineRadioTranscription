20251217 163823 Now that you've gone, I'm gonna miss you so But you should know I'm crushed You left me with a broken heart My world will fall all apart And I've gotta start all over Crushed, I'm hanging on to shattered dreams A dream that means so much to me Just one more time where we used to be Looking at you, I see the years roll by As I look in your eyes, I see the tears that dry. I wonder why. I need your love. I've done all I can just to understand that I'm crushed. You left me with a broken heart. My world fell all apart, and I've got to start over.
