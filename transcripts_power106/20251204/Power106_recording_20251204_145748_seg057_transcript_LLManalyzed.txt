David's account on the Iranian sugar deal. He needs to return and deal with the alleged American broker denounced by the Iranian authorities insistence that the contract had been negotiated bilaterally, a government to government transaction. Please, David, you owe it to the nation and the world, he says. All right, let us see if David is able to get through to us and engage us in conversation. Thank you so very much, Razor, for that. In the week ahead, we will see if we can get the conversation in with our practitioners and get some clarity, bring more clarity to the issues that you have raised. All right. So we will certainly work on that. Just a reminder then that we are having some challenges with our telephone lines and as a result of that, we are not able to connect with those of you who are calling us from Digicel, from the Digicel network, but we are able to connect to those of you on the Flow network. So please feel free to call us
