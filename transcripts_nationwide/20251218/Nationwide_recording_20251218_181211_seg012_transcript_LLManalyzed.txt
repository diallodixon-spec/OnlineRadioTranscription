20251218 181211 at the National Stadium. Conron College broke their place in the championship match with a solid 2-0 victory over McGrath High School at Draxall. Forward Shaquem Gibson was the hero for the Montego Bay Institution, scoring both goals to guide his team safely into the final. Meanwhile, Conron College advanced after a dramatic semifinal against Manning's High. The contest ended 1-1 at the conclusion of regulation time forcing the match into a penalty shootout. Clowden College held their nerve from the spot winning 4-1 on there, you know, he went out there seeing a player on the team and he did what he had been promised that he would have done. Just bring it to penalty and I'll take you guys home. Devon Anderson.
