20251223 185451 I think we mirror each other in many respects. Interesting. And speaking to law enforcement in general going into 2026, obviously we've reaped quite a few successes in 2025 with that reduction in murders and other violent crimes. Do you see the way forward in terms of bringing Jamaica out of that slump that we've suffered through so many years going into 2026 and beyond? We're able to tame that corruption beast. We're able to bring on the public support in our fight against organized crime, corruption and crime in general. I'm hoping that, you know, this is the doorway to a new Jamaica, where crime and violence doesn't dominate the headlines the way it has over the world.
