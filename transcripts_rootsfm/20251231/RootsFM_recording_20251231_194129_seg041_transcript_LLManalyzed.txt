20251231 194129 I got a sweet like pineapple, a sweet like tangerine. And I am the sweetest place, I'm waiting here for you. The way that you're giving the vibes, I just want it next to me. And I'm here watching you all night, I love all your energy. All night you're just moving. I see you know what you're doing. All are the captain. Sail away. Watch my hands on your base and I try to navigate. Sail away. Anchor down, let me dive and get a move. Sail away. Took the ends of the globe and right around the gate. Sail away. Oh, Lord, sick of flutter, go get my YouTube. Throw me overboard. I don't need no lifeguards.
