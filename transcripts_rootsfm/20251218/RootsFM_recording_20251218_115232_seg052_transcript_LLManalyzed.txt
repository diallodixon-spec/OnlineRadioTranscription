It could be somebody legitimately who saw my number in their phone, but I don't think it is that serious for somebody to saw my number in your phone and decide that they want my information because my number is in your phone. If it is that important, the number will be saved and my information will be there. If we're meant to communicate, I'm sure that we'll communicate one day. So don't rush to give people your information because they're telling you that they saw your number in their phone. Teenage girls, men are going to do that and they're going to lure you into a relationship. They're going to tell you that they saw, you can't imagine how it's a young girl who is probably 14 and somebody texts her who is this i saw your number randomly in my phone then she started telling me what's your name what you live me you know with experience you can't why she cannot tell me that because you can't you can't tell me that you saw my number in your phone randomly and you want to know who i am
