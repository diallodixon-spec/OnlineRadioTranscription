That's why I will spin forever Falling in love with you I will spin forever falling in love with you Time is erased and we need face to face. I'll be falling in love with you. Till I sit at your feet. Till I set at your feet. And my heal is complete. I will be falling in love. With you. Till everyone's fear is gone.
