You feel like this. And really, I don't want to lose my ticket in the heaven and a chance to be used by you. And if it's God that I'm after, I just can't serve two masters. And before something happens, I got to turn it all around because I know I can't just have my cake and eat it too. Because it's really easy to stay on the fence and still do you And it'd be cool if we could love the Lord and still go do our thing But see it doesn't work like that
