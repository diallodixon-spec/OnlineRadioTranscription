May we hastening your coming, O God, of Heaven, by covenanting to you in baptism. Because you are coming back for me every day. Me, as you come down, we know there will be trying times and we ask and seek after you. I don't have a choice. I don't want to die. I want to live. I want to be alive. I want to go to heaven. I want to die.
