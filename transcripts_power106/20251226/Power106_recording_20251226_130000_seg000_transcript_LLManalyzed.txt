Importers, shipments requiring you to pay customs duties and taxes are cleared on a customs goods declaration known as an IM4 or IMS4. Ask your clearing agent to provide your customs declaration, customs assessment notice and customs receipt once duties and taxes are paid. Where your clearing agent may not be able to provide the IM-4 or IMS-4, request your customs goods declaration registration number or CNUMBER which can be used to verify your payments. Importers, request your IM-4, IMS-4 or CNUMBER. It is your right! For details, email the Jamaica Customs Agency at public dot relations at jca dot gov
