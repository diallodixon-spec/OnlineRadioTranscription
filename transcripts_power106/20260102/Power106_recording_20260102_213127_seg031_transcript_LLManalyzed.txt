20260102 213127 In the summertime when the weather is hot You can stretch right up and push the sky When the weather's fine You got women, you got women on your mind Have a drink, have a drive, go out and see what you can find If a daddy's rich, take her out for a meal If a daddy's poor, just do what you feel Screed along the lane, you can count or return a twenty-five When the sun goes down, you make it bigger, good or lullaby We're not bad people We're not dirty, we're not mean We love everybody But we do as we please When the weather's fine We go fishing or go swimming in the sea
