20251216 135437 In life Like royalty, royalty If I ever make it in a life I could be livin' like royalty So me happy sitting around Never ever happy think twice, no way Me used to sleep on stagga couch Me used to sleep and curry coach Them and they never left me out Me used to live at Eddie's house Me never keep me own a key She keep my used to let me out Me bring him with me go L.A. It's like a hymn get nominated He watch the grammy side of me Cause how much people can you say Would feed you when you hungry When you brought them bless you with money But I have been so fortunate Surrounded by so many people
