I promise you will reach a goal Everything takes a little time So just wait a little while And a little time I pray to the most die But patience is the last thing on my mind So rocky life's road We living in hell Confined in a place Call that a cell, someone shoot behind the bars And a liquor did a serve, but a weed did a sell Long time in no life Mess up Black on black violence, some white people set up Look on Mama Africa Look on the whole of Jamaica No guns never make ya Everything takes a little time So just wait a little while I'm a little time I pray to the most dying But patience is the last thing on my mind If it takes a little time
