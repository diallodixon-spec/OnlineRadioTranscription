20251226 130605 I'm in love, I'm alive Intoxicated, lying high Feels like a dream When you touch me tenderly I don't know if it's for you, but I like the way you feel. You make me feel like emotions deeper than I've ever been, girl. Oh, you make me feel like an emotion. Oh, you're the one I have in my heart. In my mind I rise, you are the first thing on my mind. And in the middle of the night, I feel your heartbeat.
