20260101 125347 Tell me that you need me And I'll pretend that it's for real The way you want me to Please tell me a lie When you're lying close beside me And whisper when you hold me Sweet words like I love you Won't you tell me a lie When my night is almost over Make it easy on us both When it's time for you to go Come on, tell me a lie Say you'd really love me
