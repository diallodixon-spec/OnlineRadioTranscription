20260102 133730 I'm gonna catch, get you, carry You go, I'm going too Cause it was always you And if I'm burning blue Please don't save me Nothing left to lose Without my baby Words have a feather We should stick stick together And though I said I'd never think I was a better alone Can't change the weather, might not be forever But if it's forever, it's even better And I don't know what I'm crying for I don't think I could love you more It might not be the right thing to say I'll love you till the day that I die
