20251225 203323 Friendships and community networks that have carried us year after year celebrate the chance we now have to rebuild stronger and more united. I encourage all of us to take a moment today to give thanks for life and for each other. If you can, reach out to someone who might need a helping hand. Check on the elderly, look out for the vulnerable and keep in mind the families who suffered the hardest blows. They will need our support beyond today. As Leader of the Opposition, I stand with you. I remain committed to a Jamaica where our infrastructure is stronger, the system is fairer, and every community is safer. We will continue to push for a recovery that reaches everyone no matter where they live. My family and I send warm Christmas greetings to all Jamaicans at home and across the diaspora. We wish you a season of joy and comfort with moments of truth
