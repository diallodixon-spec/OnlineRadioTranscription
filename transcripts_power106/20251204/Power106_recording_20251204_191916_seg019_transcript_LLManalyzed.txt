Winter Olympic Games, two males and two females. And in our squad, we actually have triplets who are trying to compete for Jamaica in the 2026 Winter Olympic Games. We have one, one of the triplets is a male and two are females. The male has already qualified. We are guaranteed one person definitely going to the Winter Olympics and the two females are, they are just short of, one of them is just short of getting the points needed to qualify and the other still has a little bit to go but they are confident that with the races that they have ahead of the Winter Olympic Games, the deadline is in January, early January and they still have a month to go that they can do the races to qualify for the Olympic Games. That is really quite extraordinary, Andrew. Must admit, I'm blown away by the fact that we have a qualifier, and it looks as though there may be more coming from the Olympic Games.
