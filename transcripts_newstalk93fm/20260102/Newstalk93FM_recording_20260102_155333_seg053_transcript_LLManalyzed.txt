20260102 155333 We like to share a walk in Central Park. I could be fresh air, might be the girl of your dreams. There's no need to hide if you're into me, because I'm into you quite intimately. And maybe one night I could turn into three. Well, I'm down to see, because I make it so easy to fall in love So come give me a call And we'll fall into love On a perfect mix of Saturday night and the rest of your life And even one with a heart would agree It's so easy Fall in love with me
