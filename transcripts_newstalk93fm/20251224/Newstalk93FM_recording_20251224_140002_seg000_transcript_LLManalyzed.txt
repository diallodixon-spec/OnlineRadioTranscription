I love the way that you bring a vibe With your hands them up in the sky Rollin' back and havin' a time We like men again And we have the money to spend Yes, we jammin' down to the end See me with me carnival friend I wish you'd come from here London, I wish you come from here New York, I wish you would come from here When you come in, my baby I wish you'd came from here Atlanta, I wish you could come from here
