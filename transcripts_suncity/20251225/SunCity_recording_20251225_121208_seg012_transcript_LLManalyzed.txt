20251225 121208 I came over with my click Don't try to change it now See you, got a bounce Went two seconds ago Said you just got in the house It's hard to believe that you Are at home, by yourself When I just heard the voice Heard the voice of someone else Just this question why Do you feel, you gotta lie Getting caught up in your game When you cannot say my name I know you said that I am a super thing Something's going down, that's the way it seems Shouldn't be no reason why you act so strange If nobody's holding you back from me Cause I know how you usually do When you're saying everything to me's all true Why can't you just tell the truth? If somebody's scared then tell me who Say my name, say my name You know what feels so brown Say baby I love you When we run in games Say my name, you ain't running, baby, say my name. If no one's around, say, baby, I love you. You ain't running, babe. Say my name. Say my name, baby. You ain't the kind of shade that's calling me, baby, while it's all been changed. Say my name if no one's around. Say, baby I love you.
