20251219 133126 I have my house and I have my car Have my drink and I have my bar Have my peace and I don't want work Have my riches, I don't need part Got my money, I got my girl Got my diamonds, I got my purse Got my things and I got my wings And me fly strong, resilient and full of love. A love that moves us to give. Now at Mothers, you can pay it forward. With just $300, you can donate a meal to someone in need. Because sometimes a warm meal is more than a bellyful. It's hope, comfort and a reason to smile.
