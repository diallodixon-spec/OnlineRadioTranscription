You know, so that is how I was growing up. Um, when I was going to school, my mother was a nurse. If I complained about feeling sick, she would dose me up as I go to school. If it's cold, that's what I have to call her and tell her, Paula is running a temperature, come for her. So that is how I was grown. So this thing about calling in sick, if you're not sick, or fear, I had a responsibility as DPP to lead my team. And because all the prosecutors there are your agents, they look to you to lead, to be with them in the time of crisis, to crisis manage, to problem solve, to have their back and that responsibility as far as I'm concerned. Transcend any fear that you may have. If you have it, you better hide it.
