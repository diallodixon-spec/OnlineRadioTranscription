Severe storms can damage hospitals and other health facilities interfering with their ability to provide care to those in need. Even when facilities remain open, damaged roads may prevent safe access to care and this can lead to the interruption of schedules for medical interventions such as dialysis and chemotherapy that can make them difficult in refilling prescriptions and postponement of life-saving surgical procedures. These inconveniences can significantly increase morbidity and mortality. Storms can also disrupt healthcare supply chains, leading to health impacts at locations distant from the site of the damage.
