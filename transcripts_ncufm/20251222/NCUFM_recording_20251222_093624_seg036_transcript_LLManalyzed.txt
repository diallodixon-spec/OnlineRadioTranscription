20251222 093624 You bear your burdens, that's the least that I can do. I'll be standing in the gap for you. Just remember someone somewhere is praying for you. Calling out your name,aying for your strength I'll be standing in the lamp for you Right now you may be troubled But everything will work out fine For the spirit knows before you speak What is on your heart and mind So I'll be able to see you See you standing strong again Peace that passes understanding
