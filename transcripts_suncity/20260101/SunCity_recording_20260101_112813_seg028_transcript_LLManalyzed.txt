20260101 112813 I finally see Just the other day And I wanna say That I finally realized Where the love don't mean a thing It's so hard for me to see That you meant everything to me But I guess I gotta move on Even though it hurts, I gotta be strong If you don't wanna love me Don't love me Don't wanna touch me Don't touch me I don't need to do anything That you don't wanna do And if you don't want you to do anything that you don't want to do. And if you don't. You don't want to miss me. You don't miss me. Don't want to kiss me. Don't kiss me. I don't you to do anything you don't want.
