20251222 130405 You need me and I need you. Love and us is very special. Things you seem to do divine. You look straight into my eyes. I know what love is meant to be. Cause our souls touch to believe. Love's in life and life is living is very special in my heart there's a shield holding love is life when dreams come true and even though I can't have you, baby These eyes like these are true for you I hold my hand and take my life Through these days of adventure Once my love was gone
