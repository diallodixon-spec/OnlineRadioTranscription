20251217 202012 I'm dying to see you go I don't know where you are Every day bad to you Life and living are never thanksgiving They don't know it's short or easy The girls are more for easy Long side Tyler Now the world is hot up like fire The way we move Skin on the skin No separation, need no conversation On everything, it's automatic going zero to a hundred Right in wishing the wheels would fall off Time is ticking, it's taking you too long Right before I decide to go home And like you heard me. Only serve it up if you deserve me in. Girl, my love is worth it. Press it up, y'all. Push us down. Act like you hear me. On this, I've made up with you to serve for me in. Shake it up, love.
