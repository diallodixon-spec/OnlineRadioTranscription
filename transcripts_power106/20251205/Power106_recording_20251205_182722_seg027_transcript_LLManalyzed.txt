auctioneer called things to order? Well, the auctioneer this year, as you know, is Mr. Brian Sporty-Ritman. Things will be called to order at 12 noon. We want to ensure that we have a reasonable good sale. The numbers are down. They're very low, as you can see. A number of factors. We had a very low turnover this year in terms of the farms producing. I think for 2026, the numbers are going to be much, much higher. Because based on the report that we are getting from the farms and the breeders, the numbers have improved for 2025, has improved drastically. And you'll see a significant improvement in the number of foals. Because what Toba does, Toba would have not just taken the information from the GRC, Toba would've checked the farms, because it's our business to know what is happening on the farms, to know what numbers are coming in, to see how best we can make recommendations.
