20251229 133723 is all of us in the same keg and expects that we're all supposed to be churned out the same way. But we're not machines, we're human beings with individualities that we don't know about, some of us. So I'm just saying, you know, sometimes it's not the children, sometimes it's the environment. Everybody, as you said, different places. But the problem I have is also we have to get more mature too about education and where people are. Because it's the same reason why you'll have some people who are adults and they have a challenge reading and writing, but they don't want to say anything because people are going to look upon them a certain way. And I tell people, you know, I say listen, I'm me, you want to learn how to read and write. You't look for me any way you want to look for me at the end of the day if I enroll myself into a program that's gonna teach me to read and write how long you got how long you gonna say that about me yeah yeah how long you got to say that about me so you can't say anything
