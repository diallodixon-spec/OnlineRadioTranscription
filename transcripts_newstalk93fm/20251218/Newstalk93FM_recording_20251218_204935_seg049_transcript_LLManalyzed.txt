20251218 204935 I'm not afraid of the ocean Keep you warm and cosy You'll be coming on me arms When the storms approach, it's a wipe on me When all of us think like the tides on me The lighthouse, we are where I fallin' Deep as the blue sea Your love's flowing into me And even though the waves are rough, this love is tough. Just love me. Deep as the blue sea, deep as the blue sea. Love me really and truly. And even though the storms will come, no, we won't run. Just love me, deep as blue sea. Wherever the wind may carry us, I will never let you go. One thing I have to say to you, I just love you and it can make me gravitate to you. Give me the compass, let me navigate to you. Fly up and say that my way to you.
