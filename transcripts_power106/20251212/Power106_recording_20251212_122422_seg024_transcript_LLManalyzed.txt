2025-12-12 12:48:17 Acting SSB Barrett was speaking at a Jamaica Information Service think tank at the agency's television department earlier this week. He is assuring the public that the JCF is fully committed to safeguarding Jamaicans amid these emerging threats. The Ministry of Health and Wellness is training 3,000 individuals in psychological first aid to help deliver emotional support to those affected by Hurricane Melissa. Chief Medical Officer, C.M.O., Dr. Jacqueline Besesa-Mackenzie says 1,250 individuals have already been trained under the initiative. Dr. Besesa- Mackenzie notes that the ministry is also training teachers, community leaders, guidance counselors, health care workers, members of the security forces and church groups as psychological first aid responders. What we expect also is that knowledge will translate into the next step.
