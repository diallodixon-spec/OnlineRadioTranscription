We're anxious to hear some result or anything, but they're saying they have real work to do. You know, real painstaking work. Johnny, I've seen some case in the US where they said this has been a 25-year and a 20-year whatever, because they wait until they have, because it doesn't make sense. You say, oh, say oh it's this person that person you just want to lock up people and then at the end of it it it goes nowhere no justice is served expedients don't always serve justice that's true so police is right give them some time right give them sometime and and and see what will come what we're seeing is something have to come out of it. However long it takes, it's something have to come of it. It's quite reassuring and I'm sure the public will feel a little better knowing that the investigation continued though.
