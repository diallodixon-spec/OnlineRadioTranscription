Checking your reflection and telling your best friend. Girl, I think my butt getting big. Oh, it's getting hot in here. It's so hot. So take off all your clothes. Oh, I am getting so hot. Uh-uh, uh-uh, uh. I want to take my clothes off. Oh, It's getting hot. It's getting so hot. Oh, I'm getting so hot, I want to take all my clothes off. Let it hang on. Mix a little bit of ah, ah, with a little bit of uh. Let it hang all out. Mix a little bit of, with a little bit of. Let it just fall out. Give a little bit of with a little bit, let it hang all out with a little bit and a sprinkle of it. Let it fall out. I like it when you, girl baby.
