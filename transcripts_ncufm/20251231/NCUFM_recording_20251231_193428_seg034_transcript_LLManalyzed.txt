20251231 193428 I have no sun, no moon, no stars, no clouds, no day or night. Nothing is right if I don't have you. I have no hills, no mountains, no valleys or plains, no plateaus. Nothing goes if I don't have you There is no reason in any season of the year To live without the one I love and cherish
