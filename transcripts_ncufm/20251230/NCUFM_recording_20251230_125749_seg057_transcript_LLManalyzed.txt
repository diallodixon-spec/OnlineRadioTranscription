20251230 125749 and pure energy. A big salute to my second mate Abigail Bethune and the new sports and current Fierce Crew who always do their best to keep this ship steady. As your holiday cruise captain, Xavier Dixon, I want to remind you the holidays are about carrying joy from the kitchen to the living room. Carrying joy from laughter to love. And carrying joy from one heart to another. So as we drop anchor today, I want you to take that holiday spirit with you. May your seas be calm. May your sails be bright. And may your celebrations be full of cheer.
