20260102 090906 Yesterday Don't be jumping to conclusions God can't fix it, God won't do it real once They know this fight is only for a season So cry Just know this moment won't define your heart Don't be jumpin' to conclusions You make me say Thank you Jesus for another day rainbows remind me we gon' be okay Ignoring what detractors have to say See I must protect my peace Focus now on what you have for me Cause faith is like a mustard seed
