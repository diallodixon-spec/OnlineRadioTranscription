============================================================

No way Lord, I'm sorry for the times When I gave up on you I regret every moment When I never worshipped you Lord, I'm so sorry for allowing them To steal my joy away I won't let it happen again, no, no. Hallelujah in the name of the Lord. Thank you, Jesus Christ, at noon. Praise the Lord in the light of time. We praise, we praise, we praise your name. Hallelujah in the morning.
