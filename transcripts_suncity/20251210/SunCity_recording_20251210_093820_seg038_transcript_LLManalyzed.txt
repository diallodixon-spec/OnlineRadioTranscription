Africa, what does this crisis look like on the ground today, you know, from your opinion? Well, I think with climate change and all the different factors and all of the boundaries and borders and lack of unity and the manipulation, there's a lot of moving parts to this as to why Africa is having a food crisis, because number one, we are the original farmers, you know what I'm saying? And it seems that mentality and that legacy is nowhere to be found too much anymore. So unless Africa go back to the basics of survival, you know, we're going to have an issue. I think now though, there are people that are waking up because let me just say the way of the world is changing and this is going to sound weird. Let me just because I didn't have my coffee yet. It's going to sound weird, but what is going on? The world is a shift.
