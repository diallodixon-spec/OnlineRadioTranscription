We went to the John Golan rehab center where we did some work including painting, cleaning, and very importantly, shipping with the residents of the John Golan Rehab Center. As disciples of Christ, we are asked to bring hope to communities, to our families, and where will we go? Because that's what Christ did. Wherever he went when he was on earth, he healed the sick, he fed the hungry, and he gave hope to those who are in need. And this is what we tried to emulate.
