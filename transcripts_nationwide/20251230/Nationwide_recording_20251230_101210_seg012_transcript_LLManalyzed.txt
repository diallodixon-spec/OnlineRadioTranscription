20251230 101210 that the board decided to act and so for 714 days us the taxpayers have been paying Mark Barnett and there have been at least two people who've acted as CEO and have been acting as CEO since he was sent on administrative leave. And nobody knows how close we are to getting a resolution to this matter. Now, it is important, I believe, for the record to show. Some would have you believe that because of the difficulties and the circumstances, i.e. that damaging report from the integrity commission, which caused the board of the NWAC to send Mark Barnett an administrative leave, that Mark Barnett was some form of cancer at the NWAC. That is not true.
