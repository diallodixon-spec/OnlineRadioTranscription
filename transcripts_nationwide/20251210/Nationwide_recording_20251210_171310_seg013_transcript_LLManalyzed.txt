Meanwhile, the Jamaica public service company, the JPS, says it has met its projected December restoration targets, marking a major step in the national recovery effort after the passage of Hurricane Melissa. At a media briefing on November 13 in Montego Bay, JPS President and CEO Hugh Grant pledged to restore electricity to 95 percent of customers in St. Mary and Portland by the first week of December. He also pledged power restoration to 75% of customers in Manchester, Clarendon and St. Anne by December 10. The company now says those targets have been met and in several cases exceeded.
