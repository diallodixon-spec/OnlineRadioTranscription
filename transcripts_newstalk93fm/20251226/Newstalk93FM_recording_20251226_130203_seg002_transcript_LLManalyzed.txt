20251226 130203 And it's nothing too risky, limited liability Don't worry if you try all the things I like You could still be shy in the morning So don't feel away You don't like the fast life But look on the bright side, girl I go take the blame I just want you to come and rise it up Just a little whine there now Come and meet me at the end of the truck and we rev it up Say hold it, keep throwing it back I know why you stopped us up Baby no way, we could post up all the pictures you want When you're ready, I could oversh, darling, too good of a day But we could eat in the middle and start a bacchanal Play in the middle, hey, what we gon' do now? Jam to a rhythm, heat a carnival But we be heat, hey, what go do now? Start a wine on it, I say compromise on it
