What is it about, you always use, and Dalia said it earlier, you always encourage us to eat Jamaican, cook Jamaican meals, but you find that unique way of presenting the meals, I find that sometimes because of the way you presented it, we just fell in love with Jamaican meals. What was it, Miss Maisie, what did you do? You did your research? Tell us about how you came up with those ideas. At Grace Kitchens, we worked as a team. And we tested recipes. We had people in-house sampling. And then we also invited a panel from outside to come. And we would ask them to do, which is really sensory evaluation. And we asked them to critique, tell us what you like about it, tell us, don't critique us, just tell us what is wrong and what is good.
