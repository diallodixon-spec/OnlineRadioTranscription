20251222 132017 Where I'm all talking out of my head again Feeling like a stranger to my heart I believe that we could fall in love again But you keep stepping on the one that loves you Anyone One month ago today I was happy as a lot But now I go for walks To the movies, maybe to the park I have a seat on the same old bench To watch the children play You know tomorrow is their future
