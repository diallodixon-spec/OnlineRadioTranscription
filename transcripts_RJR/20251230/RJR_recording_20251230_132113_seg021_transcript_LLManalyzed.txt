20251230 132113 Good afternoon to all the two live faithfuls. Thank you so much for joining us one to five each and every day. I think we're the only day we're not on Sundays, right, Deli? Big ups to every time. Big 94 Business on a Tuesday. So you know it's going to be a great day today. Always a great day on the 2Live crew. Big up to Denis Lee, our producer. And I see the WhatsApp family, they are already up and running with us. Already sending in some of the birthdays and the anniversaries. We do that at 1.50 each and every weekday Monday to Friday. Yes, my man from Ploaden already up with us. Rosalie, I see you too.
