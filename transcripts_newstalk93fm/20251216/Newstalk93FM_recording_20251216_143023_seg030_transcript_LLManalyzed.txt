20251216 143023 Why you know they kept my time? Is there someone else? You did do me good to you Everyday news told you She just wasted my time Cause she don't become someone else Zip a lava for me You know they touch my body It feels good to love somebody And somebody loves you back But it feels one sided now It feels one sided now You don't have to return about it Cause it's crystal glad now, now Guess it's bye to the good times I'll be gone by the sunrise I'll be better on my own, I'll be better my own, na na Nobody should call my phone, nobody should call my phone na na This is my last heartbreak song, this is my last heart break song
