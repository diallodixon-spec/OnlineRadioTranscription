20251231 142515 Sure wish I could keep you near For more than a day So your love, your love won't slip away I remember when I held you to myself you belong to me. And over the last time has changed everything. And oh, how I wish we could start all over again. The sweeter you treat love, the longer you keep love. The sweeter, you treat love.
