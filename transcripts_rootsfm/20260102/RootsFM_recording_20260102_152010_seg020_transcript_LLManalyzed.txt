20260102 152010 Follow your heart, baby. Give in to love. Follow your heart. Trust and love today. Folks, talk. That's what they do best. Don't you let it get you down? What scares us today? We will laugh at tomorrow. It's worth the chance you take for love. When I look in your eyes, I realize there's no mountain too high for me to climb. So baby, why should we wait? We're just victims of fate, so hurry on.
