============================================================

I'll never find any words that could explain. Just how much my heart, my life, my soul, you've changed. Can you run to these open arms when no one else understands? Can we tell God in the whole world I'm no one? man. You just feel how much I love you. One touch of my hand, and I just spend my life with you. No touch has ever felt so untimely. I know deep below, I've never known. I swear this love is true.
