wrap up New Zealand's first innings when play resumes on day two of the first test at Christ Church. New Zealand are set to resume in 231 for nine in their first innings. Zach Fawkes and Jacob Duffy on four each will return to the crease for the Kiwis. Kane Williamson is so far top scored with 52 while Michael Bracewell contributed 47. Tom Blundell also made 29 and Nathan Smith 23 for the kiwis. Debutant Jamaica's OJ Shields has so far taken 2 for 34, Justin Greaves 2 for 35, and Keemah Roach 2 for 47 for the Windys. There has also been a wicket each for Jayden Seals, Johan Lane, and captain Rosten Chase. The play was halted for 90 minutes when the players were forced off field after just 3.3 overs in the contest because of rain. That's on the first day. Day 2 action begins later today. Former England batter Robin Smith has died at the age of 62. Nicknamed Judge, Smith won 62 test caps.
