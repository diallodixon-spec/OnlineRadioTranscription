20260102 120806 We're not feeling under the weather You just make me feel sweet Ice the cocoa tea, use the sugar, and together we are complete, darling. Heat me up, only you I'll want to put fire back in the store. Heat me up. And they're telling me I should leave that fire alone. Well, the more they tell me is the more I hold in your clothes. I could never let you go. Where you turn the top, make it smooth, my darling.
