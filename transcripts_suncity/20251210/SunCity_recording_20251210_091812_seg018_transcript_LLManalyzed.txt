Okay, wonderful, wonderful, wonderful. Okay. So can we start with a prayer, please? Okay. Heavenly fathers, we come before you. We know that you are our God and our father. You are the source of our existence. The very breath we breathe comes from you and we give thanks today. We praise you. We honor you. We magnify you. We glorify you, we exalt you because you are the living and true God. There is no other God besides you. None can take your place and none can compare with you. We come to say thank you, for this is the day that you have made and we have come to rejoice and we've come to be glad in it. And we thank you for the opportunity that you present to us that we can share your word that the world can hear Thus saith the Lord God that you have your way with us Lord Help us to be knitted together in harmony unity and love and through it Lord you be glorified Have your way with us now in Jesus name. Let your spirit lead us
