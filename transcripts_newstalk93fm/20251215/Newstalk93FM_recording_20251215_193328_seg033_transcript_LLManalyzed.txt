20251215 193328 Give me your everything Show you how much you mean to me Forever I must be part of it You know that I want this I know I'm nothing less Than every bit of your energy I've been patient And I've been waiting Call me stopper But I can depending on you So you better come through this time Please hear my cry and if I ever let you down, my friend It was a misunderstanding, so I thought you'd keep forgetting Then the promise from today I go chomp, like I never chomp, waste like I never waste
