My music hit me so hard, makes me say Oh my lord, thank you for blessing me with a mind to ride and two pipes feel just good when you know you're down I'm Superdome Homeboy from the old town and I'm known as such and this is good I told you homeboy, you can't touch this Yeah, that's how we livin' and you know you can't touch me Look at my eyes, man, you just can't touch me No matter how hard I try You keep pushing me inside And I can't break through There's no talking to you
