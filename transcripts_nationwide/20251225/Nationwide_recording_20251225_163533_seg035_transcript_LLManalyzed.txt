20251225 163533 Oh, baby, baby, it's a wild world It's time to get by, just don't miss my view Oh, baby baby, It's a wild world I'd love to see you, but I could try to cry You say you're hurting on me cause They say I'm hurting on you I don't need it anymore Your friends say I'm no good for you But in my heart I'm sure I'd love for life to end with you Where's me for some time to clear your mind? to play with I stayed away Hurt all my pain without your touch Now I'm back now you take Just a little bit longer baby Oh my love keeps growing stronger A little more time to save But in my head a love's on base
