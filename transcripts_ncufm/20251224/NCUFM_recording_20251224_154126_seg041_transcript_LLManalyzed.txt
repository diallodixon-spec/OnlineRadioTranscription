20251224 154126 All of creation say we bow before the ancient of days. Every tongue in heaven and earth shall declare your glory. Every knee shall bow at your throne and worship you to be exalted, O God. And your kingdom shall not pass away, oh ancient of day. Your kingdom shall reign over all the earth, sing to the ancient of day. Though none can compare to your nextless works. Sing to the ancients of age, your kingdom shall reign over all the earth.
