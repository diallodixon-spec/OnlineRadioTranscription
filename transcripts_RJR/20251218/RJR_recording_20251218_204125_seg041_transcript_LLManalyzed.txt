So we work very closely with the police in terms of compliance. So what happens is once the police receive a report that a farm has been lost or stolen, a report is sent to the FLA also. We monitor license holders because every year a license holder has to come to a farm licensing authority to register the firearm. Registration shows that the firearm is still in the person's possession. And therefore, where a person does not come in to register the firearm, our compliance unit makes contact with the police and visits the person to see if the person is dead. Maybe the person can't find the firearm.
